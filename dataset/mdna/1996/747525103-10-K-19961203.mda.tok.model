wireless telecommunications industry overview 
demand for wireless telecommunications services has grown dramatically since the commercial introduction of cellular telephony in this demand is largely attributable to the widespread availability and increasing affordability of mobile telephony  paging and other emerging wireless telecommunications services 
technological advances and a regulatory environment more favorable to competition have also served to stimulate market growth 
in less developed countries  wireless services have become an alternative to fixed wireline services which are characterized by poor quality  limited capacity and long installation waiting periods 
the company believes the demand for wireless telecommunications will continue to grow dramatically 
currently  wireless penetration in the us is estimated to be and  according to paul kagan associates  inc  is expected to be approximately by as reported by the cellular telephone industry association  the compound annual growth rate of cellular subscribers exceeded from through despite this rapid growth in the number of cellular subscribers  wireless minutes of use represent only a small percentage of total telecommunications traffic 
the company believes that the anticipated lower cost and higher quality of wireless service  combined with technological improvements in handsets  will fuel further growth in the wireless market 
in addition to lower prices  the company believes that increased voice quality  battery life and functionality and awareness of the productivity  convenience and emergency communications capability associated with wireless services will contribute to the growth in demand for wireless airtime 
technology 
wireless telecommunications service is currently available using either analog or digital technology 
the majority of cellular services transmit voice and data signals over analog based networks by varying the amplitude or frequency of one continuous electronic signal transmitted over a single radio channel 
although it is more widely deployed than digital  analog technology today has several limitations  including limited capacity  inconsistent service quality eg  poor voice quality and dropped calls  lack of effectiveness in preventing eavesdropping  susceptibility to fraud and cloning and unreliability in data transfer 
digital wireless telecommunications systems overcome the capacity constraints of analog systems by converting voice or data signals into a stream of digits that is compressed before transmission  enabling a single radio channel to carry multiple simultaneous signal transmissions 
this increased capacity  along with enhancements in digital protocols  allows digital based transfer systems to offer new and advanced services including greater call privacy  fraud protection  single number service  integrated voice and paging and enhanced wireless data transmission services such as e mail  facsimile and wireless connections to computer networks 
two primary digital technologies are available for cellular  pcs and wll applications cdma and time division multiple access tdma gsm global system for mobile communications 
in july  the telecommunications industry association tia adopted a north american interim standard is for cellular telecommunications based on qualcomm s cdma technology 
in april  the company s cdma technology was approved as a standard for pcs which was published as ansi standard j std a form of tdma has been adopted as a standard for cellular and pcs in the us and gsm has been adopted as a standard for pcs in the us and for cellular and pcs in europe 
most major telecommunications equipment manufacturers are offering both cdma and tdma gsm infrastructure and subscriber equipment  including hughes  lucent  matsushita  mitsubishi  motorola  nortel and samsung 
the company believes cdma networks will offer end users significant advantages  including increased capacity  higher quality  fewer dropped calls  lower system costs and enhanced privacy  when compared to analog and other digital technologies 
personal communications services 
pcs is a digital wireless communications system using cellular wireless technologies operating at frequencies ranging from mhz to mhz 
in order to increase competition in wireless communications and promote the rapid deployment of advanced technologies  congress enacted legislation directing the fcc to assign radio frequency licenses for pcs by competitive bidding 
in march  the fcc completed its first auction  the a block and b block auction  resulting in the award of two licenses for mhz each of spectrum in each of major trading areas 
each licensee must construct networks that serve at least one third of the population in its markets within five years of the grant of the applicable license and at least two thirds of the population within ten years 
the c block auction  comprised of mhz basic trading area bta licenses  was recently completed and the auction of the mhz d block  e block and f block bta licenses commenced in august as with digital cellular  pcs is expected to include a number of attractive features  such as i the provision of all services to one untethered  mobile number  ii low priced service options  iii in the near future  medium speed data transmissions to and from portable computers  advanced paging services and facsimile services and iv increased security and fraud protection 
wireless local loop 
wll systems provide fixed non mobile telephone services to users by transmitting voice messages over radio waves from the public switched network to the location of the fixed telephone 
wll systems are an attractive alternative to traditional copper and fiber based fixed services with the potential to be implemented more quickly and at lower cost than wireline services 
the installation of wll systems minimizes the need to obtain right of ways and excavate existing roads and infrastructure to lay copper or fiber cables 
wll systems increasingly are being adopted in developing markets in order to quickly respond to the large unmet demand for communications services 
in many international markets  including the people s republic of china  india  indonesia and brazil  fixed telephone systems are inadequate to handle demand with telephone line penetration ranging from less than to less than compared with over in major developed markets 
strategy qualcomm s strategy is to be a leading provider of cdma based digital wireless communications products  services and technologies 
the company believes its proprietary cdma technology to be an ideal base for digital cellular service  pcs  wll  data services  wireless private branch exchange pbx systems  satellite based voice and data communications and other wireless services serving broad geographic areas 
elements of qualcomm s strategy include promote worldwide commercialization of cdma cdma has emerged as the leading technology in north america for digital cellular and pcs and systems  and is a leading technology internationally 
this acceptance of the company s cdma technology is evidenced by the broad commercial deployment of cdma already undertaken in numerous markets in the us  south korea and hong kong  and the commercial deployments announced in south america  elsewhere in asia  europe and africa 
based upon public announcements by pcs licensees and cellular service providers  the company estimates that cdma technology will be employed by cellular and pcs service providers whose networks cover approximately of the us population 
in order to facilitate worldwide implementation of cdma  the company has entered into numerous royalty bearing license agreements  including agreements with twenty one subscriber  nine infrastructure  two asics and fourteen test equipment licensees 
the company continues to participate actively in various standards setting organizations  trade organizations and seminars in order to expand commercial implementation of cdma 
remain a leader in product manufacturing during fiscal  qualcomm was the leading provider of cdma based digital subscriber equipment  and a key component of the company s strategy is to remain a leading cdma equipment provider 
qualcomm manufactures infrastructure and subscriber equipment for direct sale to operators of cellular  pcs and wll applications  and supplies proprietary asics to other cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment suppliers 
the company will continue to expand its manufacturing capacity and establish strategic alliances with third parties to meet the demand for cdma infrastructure and subscriber equipment 
further  the company intends to support the sales and marketing of its cdma equipment by arranging or providing for financing for purchasers of the company s cellular  pcs and wll equipment where required 
leverage industry partnerships industry partnerships with leading domestic and international communications companies help qualcomm facilitate the development  design  funding and commercialization of new products and services  and enable the company to participate in a broader range of wireless communications product and service opportunities 
the company is licensing its cdma technology to equipment manufacturers to encourage the wide scale adoption of cdma 
in addition  qualcomm has and will continue to enter into strategic alliances  such as those with nortel and hughes  to promote the deployment of cdma equipment and generate manufacturing revenue for the company 
the company has formed qpe  a joint venture with sony  to develop and manufacture subscriber equipment 
the company has also entered into service and equipment supply agreements with numerous international partners  including alcatel  to further the penetration of omnitracs around the world 
from time to time the company may invest in domestic or international wireless carriers such as globalstar  nextwave and shinsegi mobile telecom where such investment strengthens the carriers commitment to cdma and or qualcomm s role as a supplier of equipment 
focus on core technologies qualcomm s proprietary core technologies are used in a variety of digital wireless communications systems that are deployed in terrestrial  airborne or satellite based products 
the company continues to place strong emphasis on filing and obtaining us and foreign patents and other forms of intellectual property protection for its technology 
the company has been issued approximately us patents and has patent applications pending in the united states 
the company believes that its issued patents provide broad coverage for many digital wireless applications of cdma  including satellite  cellular  cordless telephone  pcs  wireless pbx and wll applications  as well as the company s omnitracs system 
the company also actively pursues foreign patent protection in other countries of interest to the company 
the company attempts to leverage its technology across product and business areas 
cdma technology and products the company s cdma technology is a proprietary integrated software and hardware system for digitally transmitting telecommunication signals in a wireless network 
unlike analog or other digital systems  qualcomm s cdma system can reuse the same spectrum in each antenna sector of each cell in a cellular system 
this provides a more efficient use of the allocated spectrum resulting in an increase in capacity 
using the company s cdma technology  multiple calls are coded and transmitted across a mhz channel 
each cdma telephone is assigned its own code to encode analog voice signals that have been converted into digital bit streams using the company s proprietary purevoice vocoders 
the coded signals are then transmitted over the air to the cell site  where they are then processed by a cdma channel unit or modem 
the company s cdma technology competes primarily with analog and tdma gsm based systems to implement wireless systems in the cellular  pcs and wll markets 
repeated field trials have demonstrated that the company s cdma technology provides the following advantages over analog technology and the other digital technologies increased capacity 
the company s cdma technology allows a greater number of calls within the allocated frequency than other systems  thus increasing subscriber capacity to as much as to times the current analog system 
under certain system configurations  even greater capacity increases are achievable 
higher quality 
there are inherent quality advantages in the company s cdma technology that result in a consistently higher quality voice and data transmission throughout the coverage area for mobile and portable telephone operations 
fewer dropped calls 
the company s cdma technology is designed to allow for soft hand off when a user switches from one cell site to another  thus reducing the number of dropped calls compared to analog and tdma gsm systems 
enhanced privacy 
because calls made over cdma systems are low power  wide band and coded  the company s cdma technology inherently provides greatly improved privacy for users 
lower power and extended talk time 
the company s proprietary power control system constantly monitors and adjusts mobile telephone power output to the minimum level required to achieve high quality voice or data transmission 
as a result  the average power required to operate cdma handsets is typically reduced from one twenty fifth to one thousandth of the power required for analog cellular telephones that are currently available on the market 
lower average power results in longer battery life and lighter weight  lower cost portable telephones  and also significantly increases talk and standby time 
lower infrastructure costs and easier transition 
cdma systems can achieve the same level of coverage as the current analog or tdma gsm based systems using fewer cells  which reduces overall infrastructure cost and the subsequent maintenance cost of cdma systems 
in addition  the company s cdma technology is expected to offer an easier transition from analog to digital than competing technologies because less frequency must be reallocated to produce acceptable capacity gains and high quality digital service 
licensing of cdma technology as part of qualcomm s strategy to support worldwide adoption of its cdma technology  qualcomm licenses to third parties the rights to design  manufacture and sell products utilizing cdma technology

globalstar has entered into a four year agreement for qualcomm to design  develop  manufacture  install  test and maintain four gateways  two ground operations control centers and pre production subscriber terminals 
a portion of the ground operations control centers is being developed and manufactured under a subcontract by a loral subsidiary 
total revenues under the contract to qualcomm are estimated to exceed million at completion  million of which have been recognized by qualcomm to date 
qualcomm is reimbursed for its development services on a cost plus basis 
in september  globalstar completed an important milestone when forward and reverse link calls were successfully completed in a laboratory environment 
it is anticipated that globalstar will require capital of approximately billion prior to full scale commercial implementation of its system 
to date  globalstar has received funds and financing commitments totaling approximately billion 
such capital is being used  in part  to fund the development agreement 
there can be no assurance that globalstar will be successful in raising additional capital or that delays or technical or regulatory developments will not arise which could adversely affect globalstar s ability to continue funding the development agreement and which would have a material adverse affect on qualcomm s business and results of operations 
the globalstar development agreement is terminable at the election of globalstar in the event that globalstar abandons its efforts to develop the satellite based communications system 
the company s interest in globalstar is owned indirectly through certain limited partnerships 
the company s current ownership interest in globalstar is approximately 
eudora electronic mail the company has developed eudora  an electronic mail software application which is marketed in commercial and freeware versions and available for both the macintosh and windows platforms 
the company estimates that eudora currently serves over million users  including over million users of eudora s commercial version  making it the leading internet e mail application in terms of total subscribers 
eudora software adheres to internet standards so users can communicate with anyone on the internet  regardless of platform or e mail software 
the company believes that the combination of eudora and its cdma wireless technologies may create the opportunity to develop new wireless products and services in the future 
government systems qualcomm performs a variety of prime and subcontract work for various departments and agencies of the us government involving communication related technologies 
qualcomm is incorporating encryption into its cdma digital cellular system architecture for use in multiple us government applications 
as a prime contractor  qualcomm is developing wireless secure phones and may be developing deployable base stations for a wide variety of government uses 
many of these products contain additional features and enhancement that are unique to us government applications 
one such effort is the addition of dispatch capability to the digital cellular system 
qualcomm is also involved in providing globalstar products and engineering services to the us government 
like the terrestrial system  application dependent features are in review to better support the us government use of globalstar 
security and interoperability are some of the unique requirements under study 
the company is in the process of completing the production of its data link system for the us department of defense 
the system is used to support air to ground communications on training ranges and has been in production for the past four years 
the company also sells other airborne and satellite subsystems to the government and believes that future government business is an important element of its strategy and will continue to pursue work in this area for the foreseeable future 
manufacturing and backlog qualcomm began high volume manufacturing of its cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment in and has been manufacturing omnitracs terminals in high volumes since the company is in the process of expanding its manufacturing capacity for cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment 
during fiscal  production capabilities at qpe were significantly expanded which resulted in shipment of approximately  subscriber units in the fourth quarter of fiscal with higher production anticipated for fiscal the company is completing construction of a  square foot facility to manufacture cdma infrastructure equipment 
as of november   the company has shipped approximately base stations and related infrastructure equipment 
qualcomm has entered into strategic alliances with nortel and hughes relating to the development and manufacture of cdma infrastructure equipment 
see cdma technology and products infrastructure equipment and subscriber equipment 
at september   backlog and contracts subject to contingencies were approximately billion for the company 
included in backlog and contracts subject to contingencies are all customer commitments to purchase regardless of the scheduled delivery dates 
because some of these contracts may be canceled without significant penalty  the total backlog and contracts subject to contingencies may not be indicative of future results 
a significant portion of the billion backlog and supply contract reflects large contract awards in fiscal those awards include approximately million for qualcomm s share of nortel s infrastructure contract with sprint spectrum  nearly million for the sprint spectrum contract award to qpe for pcs subscriber equipment and approximately million for primeco s contract award to qpe for cellular and pcs subscriber equipment 
research and development the telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change  requiring a continuous effort to enhance existing products and develop new products 
the company maintains a substantial program of research and product development 
company sponsored research and development expenditures in fiscal years   and totaled approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
most of these expenditures are related to the company s development of cdma technology for cellular  pcs and wll applications and the continued development of the company s omnitracs system 
the company intends to continue to maintain a substantial research and development program and expects research and development expenses to increase in the future 
in addition to company sponsored research and development  the company performs contract research and development for various commercial and government agencies and contractors  including globalstar 
competition competition in the wireless communications industry is intense 
the industry consists of major domestic and international companies  many of which have financial  technical  marketing  sales  manufacturing  distribution and other resources substantially greater than those of the company 
the company competes on the basis of product quality  reliability  price  customer support and responsiveness and product features 
the company believes that it is competitive with respect to each of these factors 
cdma 
the primary competition with respect to cdma technology is from current analog and digital tdma based systems  including gsm 
gsm has been adopted as the digital cellular standard throughout europe and has received substantial international acceptance in other countries 
industry publications have reported that over countries have adopted or are deploying gsm 
in japan  the ministry of posts and telecommunications has adopted tdma as its primary digital cellular standard  which has been widely deployed throughout the country 
japan s proprietary tdma system is not compatible with either gsm or the us is tdma standard 
however  in  two of the three largest cellular service providers in japan have announced plans to offer commercial cdma service in in addition  a number of alternative radio systems are also being marketed for wll applications 
several major equipment suppliers have made substantial investments in tdma and gsm technology including alcatel  hughes  lucent  motorola  nokia  nortel and siemens  all of whom are licensees of the company  as well as ericsson 
the company also competes against its licensees in the manufacture of cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not devote a significantly greater amount of their financial  technical  marketing and other resources to aggressively market competitive communications systems or develop and adopt competitive digital cellular technologies  and that such efforts will not materially adversely affect the company s results of operations in the future 
omnitracs 
the company s primary competition to its omnitracs system operations include amsc and highwaymaster communications  inc amsc and its resellers are offering services through the amsc satellite which was launched in recently  rockwell international  the primary reseller to date of amsc services  ceased acting as an amsc reseller and transferred its customers to amsc  thereby increasing amsc s market presence 
these competitors are aggressively pricing their products and could continue to do so in the future 
in addition  these competitors are offering new value added products and services similar to those developed or being developed by qualcomm 
emergence of new competitors  particularly those offering lower cost products and future leo satellite communications systems  may impact margins and intensify competition in new markets 
the company also faces competition abroad from numerous suppliers of equipment and services 
these include inmarsat and its authorized resellers through its inmarsat c geostationary satellite service 
in addition  the company is facing competition abroad from various terrestrial based systems and specifically in europe from gsm based terrestrial systems 
all of these competitors are aggressively pricing their products and services and the company can continue to expect pricing pressures 
patents  trademarks and trade secrets the company has been issued approximately us patents and has approximately patent applications pending in the us  of which patents and patent applications relate to the company s omnitracs products and approximately patents and approximately patent applications relate to the company s cdma digital wireless technology 
the company also actively pursues foreign patent protection in countries of interest to the company 
the policy of the company is to apply for patents  or other appropriate proprietary or statutory protection  when it develops valuable new or improved technology 
the company believes that the issued patents provide broad coverage for its omnitracs system and many digital wireless applications of cdma  including satellite  cellular  cordless telephone  pcs  wireless pbx and wll and other wireless applications 
in addition to potential patent protection  the company relies on the laws of unfair competition and trade secrets to protect its proprietary rights 
the company attempts to protect its trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with customers and suppliers  proprietary information agreements with employees and consultants and other security measures 
although the company intends to protect its rights vigorously  there can be no assurance that these measures will be successful 
the company believes that  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the communications industry  patent and trade secret protections are important but must be supported by other factors such as the expanding knowledge  ability and experience of the company s personnel  new product introductions and frequent product enhancements 
employees as of september   the company and its subsidiaries employed approximately  full time and temporary employees 
of the total employees  are involved in engineering and engineering support functions  are involved in manufacturing related functions  are in sales and marketing  are general and administrative  and are in various activities which support all areas of the company 
none of the company s employees is represented by a collective bargaining agreement 
the company considers employee relations to be good

risk factors uncertainty and fluctuations of operating results 
the company has experienced quarterly variability in revenues and profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company will sustain profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
the company s future results will depend in part on continued success of its omnitracs operations  the timing and magnitude of licensing fees and royalties from the company s cdma licensees  the successful large scale implementation of the company s cdma technology and equipment  the continuation of the globalstar development contract  and the company s ability to successfully manufacture and sell commercial scale quantities of cdma infrastructure  subscriber and other equipment on a timely and profitable basis and to meet any applicable performance guarantees 
in particular  any delays in commencement of commercial operation of cdma based cellular  pcs or wll systems could have a material adverse effect on quarterly and annual operating results 
the company has experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results due to variations in the amount and timing of cdma fees and royalties 
in addition  earnings in future periods could be adversely affected in the event that the company does not meet performance obligations relative to scheduled delivery dates and performance specifications for cdma equipment 
ability to manage growth 
the company is experiencing a period of rapid growth which has placed  and is expected to continue to place  significant demands on the company s managerial  operational and financial resources 
the management of such growth will require the company to continue to improve and expand the company s management  operational and financial systems and controls  including quality control and delivery and service capabilities  and to expand  train and manage its employee base 
in particular  the company must carefully manage production and inventory levels to meet increasing product demand and new product introductions 
inaccuracies in the company s demand forecasts could quickly result in either insufficient or excessive inventories and disproportionate overhead expenses 
the company must also continue to hire and retain qualified technical  engineering and other personnel in the face of strong demand from the company s competitors and others for such individuals 
any ineffective management of growth or unsuccessful recruitment and retention of personnel could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company is experiencing significant growth in connection with the commercial implementation of its cdma technology  including significant expansion of manufacturing  test and installation capabilities  customer support capabilities  and marketing and sales personnel  which requires significant expenditures to build the necessary organizations 
the company is expanding its business into international markets which will require it to establish  manage and control operations in countries where the company has limited or no operating experience 
the company s success will depend in part upon the company s ability to successfully manage such growth 
there can be no assurance that the company s attempts to expand its manufacturing  customer support and marketing and sales organizations will be successful or will result in additional sales or profitability in any future period 
in order to accommodate planned growth  it is expected that the rate of growth of the company s operating expenses will continue to increase 
there can be no assurance that expense growth will not exceed the rate of revenue growth 
dependence on equipment sales 
an important element of the company s strategy is to remain a major supplier of cdma infrastructure and subscriber equipment worldwide for cellular  pcs and wll service providers  including c block pcs licensees in north america 
the company s ability to generate substantial revenues and profits from sales of its cdma infrastructure and subscriber equipment will require substantial capital investments by the company and is subject to risks and uncertainties 
pcs systems have a limited operating history in the united states  and the extent of demand for pcs is uncertain 
wll systems in the us and foreign countries are just beginning to be implemented  and their cost competitiveness with wireline and other wireless systems and market acceptance is uncertain 
the wireless telecommunications industry is experiencing significant technological changes 
as a result  the future prospects of the industry and the success of pcs  wll and other competing services are uncertain 
in order to commence operation  pcs and wll operators will need  among other things  to complete their system designs  acquire sites  purchase and install equipment  hire personnel in each market and raise sufficient capital to finance the construction costs and start up operating losses of their commercial systems 
to complete system build outs and implement their business plans  pcs and wll service providers will require substantial amounts of capital 
the failure of the company s customers to design  construct and launch their systems would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
the company expects that a number of its potential infrastructure and subscriber equipment customers will be c block licensees 
c block licensees are subject to a number of risks in addition to those facing other wireless service providers 
many c block licensees have limited financial resources  are highly leveraged and will require large amounts of capital to complete the build out of their systems 
there can be no assurance that c block licensees will be able to raise such capital 
c block licensees will be subject to competition from up to five additional pcs service providers  as well as the two cellular service providers in each market 
many of such other pcs and cellular service providers will have substantially greater resources than the c block licensees  who were required to qualify as small businesses in order to bid in the c block auctions 
further  there can be no assurance that future fcc auctions of wireless spectrum will not reduce the competitiveness or attractiveness of c block licensees and their systems  or that such licensees will not be sold at prices substantially less than those recorded in the c block auctions 
in addition  the c block auctions were concluded over one year following the conclusion of the a block and b block auctions  which provided the a block and b block licensees with a significant time to market competitive advantage over c block licensees 
risks related to vendor financing 
cellular  pcs and wll systems operators increasingly have required their suppliers to arrange or provide long term financing for them as a condition to obtaining or bidding on infrastructure projects 
these projects may require the company to arrange or provide financing of amounts ranging from modest sums to over a billion dollars on any particular project 
internationally  potential service providers have limited governmental or other financing sources and may have particular needs for vendor financing offered or arranged by the company 
such amounts financed may include soft costs such as software  cell site leases and permits  and thus the amount financed may exceed of infrastructure equipment costs 
pursuant to an equipment requirements agreement with qualcomm  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  nextwave is obligated to purchase approximately of its infrastructure equipment requirements from qualcomm 
the agreement also provides that qualcomm will offer financing for equipment purchased under such agreement  on commercial terms 
the terms of the equipment purchases  including financing terms  will be established in a further agreement to be negotiated in good faith between the parties 
there can be no assurance that such an agreement will be concluded 
the company s ability to arrange or provide and be competitive with such financing will depend on a number of factors  including the company s capital structure  level of available credit and ability to provide financing in conjunction with third party lenders 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to arrange or provide such financing on terms and conditions  and in amounts  that will be satisfactory to such system operators 
a number of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources than the company  which may enable them to offer more favorable financing terms and successfully compete against the company for infrastructure projects 
the inability to arrange or provide such financing or to successfully compete for infrastructure projects could have a material adverse effect on the company and its business and prospects 
in order to arrange or provide financing for cellular  pcs and wll projects  the company will be required to expose itself to significant project  market  political and credit risks 
the company may be required to provide such financing directly  and or guaranty such financing through third party lenders 
the amount of such financing could become significant and  if not repaid by the network operator  could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results and liquidity 
the company may be required to maintain any such extensions of credit  or remain obligated under guarantees  until maturity  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s credit rating 
although the company may seek to have third parties assume some or all of any such credit arrangements  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
many wll and pcs network operators  including a number of c block licensees  have limited or no operating histories  are faced with significant capital requirements and are high credit risks 
pursuant to fcc regulations applicable to c block licensees  the company will not be permitted to retain a security interest in any c block licenses  which initially will constitute the primary asset of many c block licensees 
c block licensees are faced with strict regulatory requirements under applicable fcc regulations 
compliance with those regulations is outside of the control of the company 
the failure of a c block licensee to comply with any of those regulations could result in the revocation of that licensee s fcc licenses 
the company has limited experience evaluating the credit worthiness or commercial viability of potential purchasers of cdma equipment  and there can be no assurances that such customers will not default on any financing arranged or provided by the company for the purchase of its cdma equipment 
the company may be required to provide vendor financing for a portion of the globalstar system prior to its full scale implementation 
see dependence on key customers 
future capital needs 
the design  development  manufacture and marketing of digital wireless communication products and services are highly capital intensive 
in addition  cellular  pcs and wll systems operators increasingly have required their suppliers to arrange or provide long term financing for them as a condition to obtaining or bidding on infrastructure products 
to the extent that such cash resources are insufficient to fund the company s activities  the company may be required to raise additional funds from a combination of sources including potential debt or equity issuances 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on reasonable terms or at all 
if additional capital is raised through the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities  dilution to the company s stockholders could occur 
patents and proprietary information 
the company relies on a combination of patents  copyrights  trade secrets  trademarks and proprietary information to maintain and enhance its competitive position 
the company has been granted approximately patents and has approximately patent applications pending in the united states  of which patents and patent applications relate to the company s omnitracs products and approximately patents and approximately patent applications relate to the company s cdma digital wireless technology 
the company also actively pursues patent protection in other countries of interest to the company 
there can be no assurance that the pending patent applications will be granted  that the company s patents or copyrights will provide adequate protection  or that the company s competitors will not independently develop or initiate technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to the company s technologies 
there can also be no assurance that the confidentiality agreements upon which the company relies to protect its trade secrets and proprietary information will be adequate 
from time to time  certain companies may assert exclusive patent  copyright and other intellectual proprietary rights to technologies which are claimed to be important to the industry or to the company 
in addition  from time to time third parties provide the company with copies of their patents relating to spread spectrum and other digital wireless technologies and offer licenses to such technologies  and the company evaluates such patents and the advisability of such licenses 
if any of the company s products were found to infringe on protected technology  the company could be required to redesign such products  license such technology  and or pay damages to the infringed party 
if the company is unable to license protected technology used in the company s products or to redesign such products  the company could be prohibited from marketing such products 
ericsson  motorola and interdigital have each advised the tia that they hold patent rights in technology embodied in is lucent and oki electric have claimed patent rights in is in accordance with tia guidelines  each company has confirmed to the tia that it is willing to grant licenses under its rights on reasonable and nondiscriminatory terms 
in connection with the settlement and dismissal of the company s patent litigation with interdigital  the company received  among other rights  a fully paid  royalty free license to use and to sublicense the use of those patents claimed by interdigital to be essential to is if the company and other equipment manufacturers are required to obtain additional licenses and or pay royalties to one or more patent holders  this could have an adverse effect on the commercial implementation of the company s cdma technology 
on september   ericsson inc and telefonaktiebolaget lm ericsson ericsson filed suit in the us district court for the eastern district of texas  civil action no 
cv the complaint alleges that various elements of the company s cdma equipment system and components infringe one or more patents owned by ericsson 
the company has not yet filed a formal response to ericsson s complaint 
although there can be no assurances that an unfavorable outcome would not have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  financial position or results of operations  the company believes the complaint has no merit and will vigorously defend the action 
on november  the company was served with a complaint in connection with a lawsuit filed in the us district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania by btg usa inc the complaint alleges that the company s global positioning system  cdma telecommunications products and the omnitracs system components thereof infringe united states patent no 
re 
 the patent expired in november although there can be no assurances that an unfavorable outcome would not have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity  financial position or results of operations  the company believes the complaint has no merit and will vigorously defend the action 
manufacturing of cdma equipment 
qualcomm has received orders for cdma wireless communications infrastructure and subscriber equipment and asic components for delivery in fiscal and expects to receive additional orders in the future 
the company is investing substantial amounts in product development activities to maintain or improve its competitive position 
the company may spend substantially more on such software and hardware development than currently anticipated 
the company has significantly expanded and will continue to significantly expand its infrastructure and subscriber equipment manufacturing capabilities 
many of the company s competitors have greater resources and experience with such large scale manufacturing 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to timely or effectively accomplish such increases in production volume 
any delays or difficulties in connection with the planned increase in manufacturing capacity could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
if the company is unable to manufacture cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment at commercially acceptable costs  or if the company expands its manufacturing capacity but is unable to secure sufficient orders for its cdma equipment  the company s competitive position and the ability of the company to achieve a profitable return on its cdma research and development expenditures could be materially impaired 
the manufacture of wireless communications equipment is a complex and precise process involving specialized manufacturing and testing equipment and processes 
defects or impurities in the components or materials used  equipment failure or other difficulties could adversely affect the company s ability to meet planned production yields 
there can be no assurance that the company will not encounter difficulties in achieving planned yields on its products  which would adversely affect its margins and operating results 
the company manufactures its cdma cellular and pcs subscriber equipment through qpe  a joint venture between the company and a subsidiary of sony electronics 
the risks associated with the commercial manufacture of the company s infrastructure and subscriber equipment products which are described in this document also apply to the manufacture of subscriber equipment by qpe 
to the extent that qpe experiences any of the complications  delays or interruptions described herein  the company s results of operations would be adversely affected 
dependence on suppliers 
the company has from time to time experienced delays in obtaining quantities of specification compliant rf components and other parts to meet the demands for its equipment 
several of the critical products and services used in the company s existing and proposed products  including asics  flash memory chips and certain rf components used in the company s cdma products and certain custom and semi custom vlsi circuits and other sophisticated electronic parts and major subassemblies used in the omnitracs system  are currently available only from single or limited sources 
the reliance on sole or limited source vendors by the company and its licensees involves risks  including the possibility of shortages of certain key components  product performance shortfalls  and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing capability  quality and costs 
business disruptions or financial difficulties of a sole or limited source supplier of any particular component could materially and adversely impact the company by increasing the cost of goods sold or reducing the availability of such components 
while the company believes that it could obtain necessary components from other manufacturers  an unanticipated change in the source of supply of these components could trigger performance guarantees or cause significant shipment delays in the company s products 
unanticipated supply limitations could adversely affect the company s ability to meet its product orders 
there can be no assurance that the supplier commitments will be met 
the company is also working with its vendors to obtain expanded volumes of specification compliant components 
there may be significant demand on the company s suppliers from other manufacturers including the company s licensees for such components 
delays in the availability or reduced quantities of these components could adversely affect the company s ability to manufacture subscriber equipment in the volumes and within the time frames required by its customers  which could result in lost revenues and profits and possible performance guarantee payments 
see performance guarantees 
certain components require an order lead time of six months or longer 
other components that currently are readily available may become difficult to obtain in the future 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience delays in the receipt of certain of its key components 
delays or the failure of the company to order sufficient quantities of these components in advance could prevent the company from meeting production requirements and could result in the requirement to pay performance guarantees 
to meet forecasted production levels  the company may be required to commit to certain long lead time items prior to contract award 
if forecasted orders are not awarded  the company may be faced with large inventories of slow moving or unusable parts which could have an adverse affect on the company s results of operations 
rapid technological change and new products 
the market for the company s products is characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards  changes in customer requirements and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
the introduction of products embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could render the company s existing products and products currently under development obsolete and unmarketable 
accordingly  the company s future success will depend upon its ability to enhance its current products and develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments  satisfy varying customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments or customer requirements  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  could damage the company s competitive position and have an adverse effect on revenues and results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing new equipment products on a timely basis or that the company will not experience significant delays in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operations 
in addition  there can be no assurance that new products developed by the company will achieve market acceptance 
performance guarantees 
qualcomm and qpe have entered into contracts that provide for performance guarantees to protect customers against late delivery or failure to perform 
these performance guarantees  and any future commitments for performance guarantees  are obligations entered into separately  and in some cases jointly  with partners to supply cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment 
certain of these obligations provide for substantial performance guarantees that accrue at a daily rate based on percentages of the contract value to the extent the equipment is not delivered by scheduled delivery dates or the systems fail to meet certain performance criteria by such dates 
the company is dependent in part on the performance of its suppliers and strategic partners in order to provide equipment which is the subject of the guarantees 
thus  the ability to timely deliver such equipment may be outside of the company s control 
if the company and qpe are unable to meet their performance obligations  the payment of the performance guarantees could amount to a significant portion of the contract value and would have a material adverse effect on product margins and the company s results of operations 
dependence on key customers 
a significant portion of the company s cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment sales are  and are expected to continue to be  concentrated with a limited number of customers 
as a result  the company s performance will depend significantly on relatively large orders from a limited number of customers  as well as gaining additional customers  both within existing cellular  pcs and wll markets and in new markets 
the loss of any existing customer for cdma equipment or the failure of the company to gain additional customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company has entered into a four year development agreement with globalstar to design and develop subscriber equipment and ground communications stations of the globalstar system through through september   the company has recognized revenues of approximately million under the globalstar agreement and expects to recognize significant revenues under the contract during fiscal years and it is anticipated that globalstar will require capital of approximately billion prior to full scale commercial implementation of its system 
to date  globalstar has received funds and financing commitments totaling approximately billion 
such capital is being used  in part  to fund the development agreement 
there can be no assurance that globalstar will be successful in raising additional capital or that delays or technical or regulatory developments will not arise which could adversely affect globalstar s ability to continue funding the development agreement and which would have a material adverse effect on qualcomm s business and results of operations 
the globalstar development agreement is terminable at the election of globalstar in the event that globalstar abandons its efforts to develop the satellite based communications system 
cdma commercialization 
the company s cdma technology has been launched commercially for pcs and cellular applications in the us  hong kong and south korea 
the successful implementation and operation of such systems is a complex process requiring coordination of a number of factors  including the successful interface between infrastructure and subscriber equipment from multiple vendors and the public wireline network  as well as avoiding interference from microwave and cellular systems 
there can be no assurance that unforeseen complications will not arise as more subscribers are added to these systems or in the scale up and operation of other commercial cdma systems that could materially delay or limit the commercial use of the company s cdma technology 
further  if the company s licensees are unable to deliver cdma equipment to the market on a timely basis  or if carriers which have adopted cdma fail to deploy their systems on a timely basis  the company s business and the reputation of the company s cdma technology could be adversely affected 
a number of companies with international operations are developing and implementing competing cellular  pcs and wll technologies 
while the company strongly believes that cdma is superior to competing digital technologies and is actively promoting the benefits of its cdma technology outside of the us  there can be no assurance that the company will receive significant international acceptance of its cdma technology for cellular  pcs or wll applications due to the installed base of gsm systems and competition from the us and japanese tdma systems 
in some countries  the company s cdma products may be required to undergo extensive testing and certification by government entities before cdma can be approved for commercial use in those countries 
dependence on omnitracs 
omnitracs systems  complementary software products  related messaging service and maintenance services historically have accounted for a significant portion of the company s total revenues and margins 
the company expects that revenues and margins from its omnitracs operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of the company s total revenues and margins 
a significant portion of the company s omnitracs revenues is derived from the north american trucking industry  particularly providers of long haul transportation of goods and equipment 
any adverse events affecting the domestic trucking industry could have a material adverse effect on the company s omnitracs revenues 
although an increasing portion of the company s omnitracs revenues is derived from ongoing messaging and maintenance revenues  new customer sales of the company s omnitracs systems are important to the company to maintain continued growth 
in addition  the company has been experiencing pricing pressure from competitors on sales of its omnitracs products and messaging services  which could result in further reduction of the margins for such products and services 
see business competition 
the company expects that an increasing portion of its future omnitracs sales will be derived from international sales 
there can be no assurance that the company s domestic or international omnitracs business will continue to grow at the levels experienced in the past  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
competition 
competition in the wireless communications industry is intense 
the industry consists primarily of major domestic and international companies which have financial  technical  marketing  sales  manufacturing  distribution and other resources substantially greater than those of the company 
many of these companies are licensees of the company s technology  and have established market positions  trade names  trademarks  patents  copyrights and intellectual property rights and substantial technological capabilities 
see business competition 
the primary competition with respect to cdma technology is from current analog and digital tdma based systems  including gsm and dcs  the gsm implementation for pcs in the us gsm has been adopted as the digital cellular standard throughout europe and has received substantial international acceptance in other countries 
industry publications have reported that over countries have adopted or are deploying gsm 
in japan  the ministry of posts and telecommunications has adopted tdma as its primary digital cellular standard  which has been widely deployed throughout the country 
japan s proprietary tdma system is not compatible with either gsm or the us is tdma standard 
however  in  two of the three largest cellular service providers in japan have announced plans to offer commercial cdma service in in addition  a number of alternative radio systems are also being marketed for wll applications 
many of the major equipment suppliers have made substantial investments in tdma and gsm technology including alcatel  hughes  lucent  motorola  nokia  nortel and siemens all of whom are licensees of the company  as well as ericsson 
the company also competes against its licensees in the sale of cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment 
there can be no assurance that the company s competitors will not devote their significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources to aggressively market competitive communications systems or develop and adopt competitive digital cellular technologies  and that such efforts will not have a materially adverse effect on the company s results of operations in the future 
moreover  certain equipment manufacturers may offer extremely attractive financing terms as a means of gaining access to the us pcs market 
the company s primary competition to its omnitracs system includes american mobile satellite corporation amsc and highwaymaster communications  inc amsc and its resellers are offering services through the amsc satellite which was launched in recently  rockwell international  the primary reseller to date of amsc services  ceased acting as an amsc reseller and transferred its customers to amsc  thereby increasing amsc s market presence 
these competitors are aggressively pricing their products and could continue to do so in the future 
in addition  these competitors are offering new value added products and services similar to those developed or being developed by qualcomm 
emergence of new competitors  particularly those offering low cost products and future leo satellite communications systems  may impact margins and intensify competition in new markets 
the company also faces competition abroad from numerous suppliers of equipment and services 
these include inmarsat and its authorized resellers through its inmarsat c geostationary satellite service 
in addition  the company is facing competition abroad from various terrestrial based systems and specifically in europe from gsm based terrestrial systems 
all of these competitors are aggressively pricing their products and services and the company can continue to expect pricing pressures 
as with the us operations  the international business may also experience competition in the future from leo satellite communications systems 
equipment sales by cdma licensees 
full commercial implementation of the company s cdma technology requires that subscriber and infrastructure equipment be made available in commercial quantities in a timely and cost effective manner 
although the company is a supplier of certain cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment  the company expects that a major portion of the subscriber and infrastructure equipment that will be made commercially available will be supplied by the company s licensees 
if cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment is not delivered to the market on a timely basis  customers could select other digital wireless technologies 
availability of equipment and other factors are critical for cdma technology to be chosen for wireless applications 
the amount and timing of resources devoted by licensees to the development of cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment are controlled by such licensees  and thus the timing of the availability of third party equipment is not under the company s control 
reliance on satellite and other facilities for omnitracs service 
the company s omnitracs system currently operates in the us market on leased ku band satellite transponders 
the company s data satellite transponder lease runs through the company s position reporting satellite transponder runs through may  with the rights to extend through may the company believes that its current domestic transponder capacity is adequate to support over  omnitracs terminals  assuming current per unit message and position reporting volumes 
future system enhancements may allow for increased utilization of transponder capacity 
the company believes that us omnitracs operations may require additional transponder capacity in fiscal year which it believes will be available on acceptable terms 
however  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to acquire additional transponder capacity on acceptable terms on a timely basis 
any failure of the company to maintain adequate satellite capacity would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial results 
the company s nmf operations are subject to the risk that a failure or natural disaster could interrupt the omnitracs service and have a material adverse effect on omnitracs revenues 
the company maintains a fully operational nmf in las vegas  nevada as a backup to its primary nmf in san diego  california 
see business omnitracs 
factors affecting international business 
revenues from international customers accounted for approximately of total revenues in fiscal  of total revenues in fiscal and of total revenues in fiscal because certain joint ventures between the company and foreign firms provide for a minority ownership position by the company in the joint venture  the company may be limited in taking actions it might otherwise wish to pursue 
since the company is a relatively new entrant into some of these markets and its competitors may have long standing  entrenched positions  it may be difficult for the company to succeed in certain markets  thereby limiting international sales 
other risks faced by the company in its international business include unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export controls  national standards  currency exchange rates  expropriation  tariffs or other barriers  political risks  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  and potentially negative tax consequences 
these factors could have an adverse impact on the company s operating results 
the company is subject to us export control laws and regulations with respect to all of the company s products and technology that are exported from the united states 
the company is subject to the risk that more stringent export control requirements could be imposed in the future on product classes that include products exported by the company  which would result in additional compliance burdens on the company or ensure the enforceability of its contract rights 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries  including developing nations in asia  south america  africa and eastern europe  may not protect the company s intellectual property rights or ensure the enforceability of its contract rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
uncertainty of government regulation 
the company s products are subject to various fcc regulations in the us these regulations require that the company s products meet certain radio frequency emission standards and not cause unallowable interference to other services 
the company is also subject to government regulations and requirements by local and international standards bodies outside the us  where the company is less prominent than local competitors and has less opportunity to participate in the establishment of regulatory and standards policies 
changes in the regulation of the company s activities  including changes in the allocation of available spectrum by the us government and other governments  or exclusion of its technology by a standards body  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and its ability to market its products and services 
the company is also subject to state and federal health  safety and environmental regulations as well as regulations related to the handling of and access to classified information 
reliance on key personnel 
the company s success depends in a large part upon its ability to retain highly qualified technical and management personnel  the loss of one or more of whom could have a material adverse effect on the business of the company 
none of these individuals has an employment contract with the company 
the company s success also depends upon its ability to continue to attract and retain highly qualified personnel in all disciplines 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring or retaining requisite personnel 
product liability 
testing  manufacturing  marketing and use of the company s products entail the risk of product liability 
while the company currently has product liability insurance that it believes is adequate to protect against product liability claims  no assurance can be given that the company will be able to continue to maintain such insurance at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect the company against losses due to product liability 
an inability to maintain insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of the company s products 
in addition  a product liability claim or recall could have a material adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the company 
news reports have asserted that power levels associated with hand held cellular telephones may pose certain health risks 
the company is not aware of any study that has concluded that there are any significant health risks from using hand held cellular telephones 
if it were determined that electromagnetic waves carried through the antennas of cellular telephones create a significant health risk  there could be a material adverse effect on the company s ability to market and sell its wireless telephone products 
anti takeover measures  rights plan 
the company s certificate of incorporation provides for cumulative voting in the election of directors 
in addition  the company s certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors and includes a provision the fair price provision that requires the approval of the holders of at least of the company s voting stock as a condition to a merger or certain other business transactions with  or proposed by  a holder of more than or more of the company s voting stock  except in cases where certain directors approve the transaction or certain minimum price criteria and other procedural requirements are met 
the company s certificate of incorporation also requires the approvals of holders of at least of the company s voting stock to amend or change the provisions relating to the classified board  cumulative voting or the fair price provision 
the company s certificate of incorporation also requires that any action required or permitted to be taken by stockholders of the company must be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders of the company and may not be effected by any consent in writing 
the classified board  fair price provision and other charter provisions may discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of the company  including transactions in which the stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices  and may limit the ability of stockholders to approve transactions that they may deem to be in their best interests 
further  pursuant to the terms of its preferred share purchase rights plan  the company has distributed a dividend of one right for each outstanding share of common stock 
in the event the convertible preferred securities are converted into common stock  each share of such common stock will also be granted a right 
these rights will cause substantial dilution to the ownership of a person or group that attempts to acquire the company on terms not approved by the board of directors and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts 
in addition  the board of directors has the authority to fix the rights and preferences of and issue shares of preferred stock  which may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company without action by the stockholders 
volatility of stock price 
historically  the company s stock price has been volatile 
the sales prices for the company s common stock have ranged from to during the past weeks 
see item market for registrants common stock and related stockholders matters 
future announcements concerning the company or its competitors  including the selection of wireless technology by cellular  pcs and wll service providers  the timing of roll out of those systems  the receipt of substantial orders for infrastructure or subscriber equipment  results of technological innovations  new commercial products  changes in recommendations of securities analysts  government regulations  proprietary rights or product or patent litigation  may have a significant impact on the market price of the company s common stock 
the company s future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfalls in revenues or earnings from the levels expected by securities analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given period

overview qualcomm commenced operations in july  initially providing contract research and development services and limited product manufacturing 
in december  the company began shipping its two way omnitracs mobile terminals and providing messaging services to its omnitracs system customers 
the company has also been involved in the development and commercialization of its proprietary code division multiple access cdma technology for digital wireless communication applications  including digital cellular  personal communication services pcs and wireless local loop wll applications and now is involved in production of its own products for those markets 
the company s revenues generated from its proprietary cdma technology have historically been derived primarily from license  royalty and development fees and contract agreements with domestic and international wireless communications equipment suppliers  service providers and research organizations 
although the company expects to continue to receive cdma license  royalty and development fees from its existing agreements and may receive similar fees and royalties from new licensees  the amount and timing of these cdma fees and royalties will depend on the extent to which and when the company s cdma technology is commercially implemented 
delays in roll out or commencement of commercial operation of cellular  pcs or wll systems could have a material adverse effect on quarterly and annual revenues 
the company has experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in quarterly and annual operating results due to variations in the amount and timing of cdma fees and royalties 
the company began manufacturing significant volumes of cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment during fiscal production capabilities at qualcomm personal electronics qpe were significantly expanded which resulted in production of approximately  subscriber units in fiscal with higher production anticipated for fiscal the company shipped the first significant volumes of pcs phones in the fourth quarter of fiscal infrastructure production began during fiscal and is expected to continue to grow into fiscal the company  either directly or through qpe  has entered into agreements with sprint spectrum  primeco personal communication lp primeco and northern telecom nortel pursuant to which the company or qpe has agreed to provide approximately million  million and million  respectively  in cdma equipment and services 
the company is subject to performance guarantees on these orders 
in september  the company and hughes network systems hughes entered into an agreement whereby hughes has agreed to purchase a minimum percentage of cdma infrastructure equipment from qualcomm for resale to hughes customers 
any delays or difficulties in connection with the planned increase in manufacturing capacity could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
if the company is unable to manufacture cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment at commercially acceptable costs and on a timely basis  the company s competitive position and the ability of the company to achieve a profitable return on its cdma research and development expenditures could be materially impaired 
revenues related to cdma application specific integrated circuits asic component shipments to licensees also realized significant growth in fiscal to support the manufacture of cdma equipment  qualcomm shipped over million of its cdma asics in fiscal domestically  the company generates revenues from its domestic omnitracs business by manufacturing and selling omnitracs terminals and related application software packages and by providing ongoing messaging and maintenance services to omnitracs users 
competition in resulted in a reduction of the margins on unit sales and services 
the company generates revenues from its international omnitracs business through license fees  sales of network equipment and terminals and fees from engineering support services 
messaging services are provided by service providers that operate network management centers for a region under licenses granted by the company 
since the introduction of omnitracs  the company has shipped over  omnitracs units worldwide 
the company has experienced  and expects to continue to experience  increased operating expenses as a result of the company s overall expansion 
in fiscal  operating expenses were significantly higher  although operating expenses as a percentage of revenue declined 
the increase was primarily due to increased research and development expenditures  expanded sales and marketing efforts and overall expansion of the business base 
in fiscal the company expects to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and to increase sales and marketing expenses as the company s products are marketed throughout the world 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of total revenues represented by certain consolidated statement of operations data years ended september  revenues communications systems contract services license  royalty and development fees total revenues operating expenses communications systems contract services research and development selling and marketing general and administrative litigation settlement and related costs total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net minority interest in loss of consolidated subsidiary equity in losses of joint ventures income before income taxes income tax expense net income communications systems costs as a percentage of communications systems revenues contract service costs as a percentage of contract services revenues the company s fiscal periods end on the last sunday of each period 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues for fiscal were million  a increase compared to million for fiscal revenue growth was primarily due to the growth in communications systems which was driven by increased revenues related to subscriber  asic  and infrastructure products  as well as increased messaging revenues and sales of omnitracs units internationally 
also contributing were higher license  royalty and development fees related to additional cdma licensing and royalties 
communications systems revenues  which consisted primarily of revenues from the sale of omnitracs products and services  sales of cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment  and asics chip sales were million in fiscal  a increase compared to revenues of million for fiscal the growth in communications systems revenues for fiscal was primarily attributable to increased sales in subscriber equipment  producing approximately  phones in fiscal  and increased asic sales  with sales of over two million chips to cdma licensees 
infrastructure sales were also higher primarily driven by component shipments to nortel 
omnitracs messaging revenues continue to increase due to the expansion of the installed omnitracs base in the us omnitracs international shipments increased in fiscal due primarily to expansion of unit shipments 
contract services revenues for fiscal were million  a increase compared to million for fiscal the increase resulted primarily from the development agreement with globalstar which has continued to ramp up since its inception in fiscal license  royalty and development fees for fiscal were million  a increase  compared to million for fiscal the increase was primarily as a result of a number of new cdma license agreements signed in fiscal to date  the company has entered into numerous royalty bearing license agreements including agreements with twenty one subscriber  nine infrastructure  two asics and fourteen test equipment licensees 
increased cdma royalties  generated through equipment sales by licensees  also contributed to the revenue growth 
costs of communications systems  which consisted primarily of costs of manufacturing omnitracs units  operating the nmf and leasing ku band satellite transponders and manufacturing cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment  and asics components  were million or of communications systems revenues for fiscal  compared to million or of communications systems revenues for fiscal the dollar increase in costs primarily reflects increased shipments of cdma subscriber and infrastructure equipment and increased asics volume 
the increase in communications systems costs as a percentage of communications systems revenues was due to previously anticipated start up costs associated with the manufacturing of cdma subscriber  infrastructure  and asic products and increasing volumes of cdma subscriber equipment and components 
such subscriber equipment generates lower margins than the company s omnitracs business which was the major element of communication systems revenues in fiscal contract services costs for fiscal were million or of contract services revenues  compared to million or of contract services revenues for fiscal the increase in costs was primarily related to the significant growth in the globalstar development effort 
the percentage decrease in contract services costs as a percentage of contract services revenues was related to the overall growth and relative mix of labor and subcontract costs on the globalstar development contract 
research and development costs were million or of revenues for fiscal  compared to million or of revenues for fiscal this dollar increase was attributable primarily to increased efforts toward the development of commercial cdma infrastructure and subscriber equipment  and asic components 
the company anticipates continued growth of research and development expenditures into fiscal selling and marketing expenses were million or of revenues for fiscal  compared to million or of revenues for fiscal the dollar increase in selling and marketing was due primarily to the growth in personnel and other marketing expenses  primarily related to the introduction of cdma products in the domestic and international marketplace  and to support sales growth in the omnitracs 
the company opened three new international offices in fiscal and now has offices in twelve countries to provide a base for operations  sales  marketing and support of qualcomm products worldwide 
general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million or of revenues  compared to million or of revenues for fiscal the dollar increase was driven primarily by additional personnel and associated overhead costs necessary to support the overall growth in the company s operations 
general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues declined due to the significantly increased revenue base in fiscal also  during the second quarter of fiscal  the company and hughes agreed to dismiss their respective litigation against each other without penalty by either party 
in fiscal  the company had accrued million for the anticipated liability for legal fees 
as a result of the settlement of this litigation  the company reversed this accrual in the second quarter of fiscal  resulting in a million reduction to general and administrative expense 
interest income was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase in fiscal was primarily due to interest generated from the public offering proceeds received in august interest expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increased outstanding debt and capital leases related to the qpe joint venture 
the minority interest primarily consists of sony s share of the losses of qpe  a joint venture consolidated in the company s financial statements 
income tax expense was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower pretax earnings in fiscal and the incorporation of the additional tax losses from the guarantee of globalstar vendor financing obligations 
the effective tax rate in fiscal was compared to in fiscal the company has not elected early adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
fas becomes effective beginning in fiscal year  and will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
upon adoption of fas  the company will continue to measure compensation expense for its stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb opinion no

the company is evaluating these alternatives  and is considering multiple sources of funding including unsecured bank facilities  preferred securities and or convertible debt 
there can be no assurances such capital will be available or  if available  that it will be on acceptable terms
