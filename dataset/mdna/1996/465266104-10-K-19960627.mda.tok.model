item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition results of operations continuing operations overview the company operates in one industry segment and provides a broad range of environmental management services to clients principally in the united states 
the company s principal strategy is to market its services on a full service basis 
the company s operations are managed under a structure consisting of three regions comprising regional operations and national project operations 
the two complement each other as regional operations provides full service capabilities locally and project operations manages large projects with construction requirements 
project management  technical  sales and support functions are present in each of the regions and are coordinated by a national functional leader 
accordingly  it offers all of its services to all clients 
the company has changed its fiscal year in to consist of four thirteen week fiscal quarters with the fourth quarter ending on the last friday of march 
international technology corporation results of operations continued revenues revenues for fiscal year declined by compared to an increase of in fiscal year effective with the inception of operations for quanterra in the second quarter of fiscal year  the company ceased recording any analytical services revenue 
however  since a portion of analytical services revenue historically was derived from the company s other operations  additional revenue is now being recorded related to analytical services subcontracts performed by quanterra for it  similar to other third party subcontracts 
after excluding fiscal year and analytical services revenues other than those provided to the company s other operations  revenues for the company declined for fiscal year and increased for fiscal year during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company experienced a decrease in revenues to  from  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  primarily due to the slowdown of awards of federal governmental contract delivery orders caused by the delayed authorization of the federal government budget 
additionally  current fourth quarter revenues were adversely impacted by unusually severe weather in much of the united states  which held up field work on several projects 
this fourth quarter decline was the primary cause of the fiscal year revenue decline since revenues excluding analytical services for fiscal year were up through the first three quarters of the year compared to the prior year 
in fiscal year  the higher revenue level was due primarily to an increased number of remediation contracts under federal governmental programs 
a substantial percentage of the company s revenues during the three years ended march  was earned through executing governmental contracts for various federal  state and local agencies 
revenues from governmental contracts accounted for of the company s revenues in fiscal year  compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
see the table in business operations customers federal  state and local governmental clients for an analysis of the company s revenues attributable to federal  state and local governmental contracts 
federal governmental revenues are derived principally from work performed for the dod and  to a lesser extent  the doe 
an expected transition by the doe over the next several years to emphasize remediation over studies is expected to be positive for the company based on the company s favorable experience in winning and executing similar work for the dod as well as the company s experience with doe related to its past performance of doe studies 
in the near term  the company expects that the percentage of total revenues from the execution of federal  state and local governmental contracts will continue to be substantial 
after lengthy delays  the us congress has enacted legislation providing current fiscal year environmental cleanup budgets for dod  doe and usepa s superfund which resulted in reductions of  and  respectively  from prior year levels 
for the upcoming fiscal year  the clinton administration has proposed budgets for each program that maintain this year s funding level 
congress is considering a substantial increase in usepa s superfund cleanup budget  contingent upon reauthorization of cercla this year  and a increase in doe s cleanup budget 
failure of the congress to increase future environmental restoration funds may adversely affect future government contracting opportunities and funding of the company s contracted backlog 
commercial work has increased slightly in fiscal year  reflecting management efforts to reduce the company s reliance on governmental contracts 
the company believes this increase would have been greater if commercial clients were not delaying certain work until final congressional action is taken on the reauthorization of cercla 
funding authority under cercla lapsed on december   and it is uncertain when reauthorization will occur or what the details of the legislation  including retroactive liability  cleanup standards  and remedy selection  may include 
uncertainty regarding possible congressional rollbacks of environmental regulation and enforcement have led commercial clients to delay projects as well  although there are recent indications of a reduction in the likelihood of significant rollbacks 
contemplated changes in regulations could decrease the demand for certain of the company s services  as customers anticipate and adjust to the new regulations 
however  the proposed legislation could also result in increased demand for certain of the company s services if regulatory changes decrease the cost of remediation projects or result in more funds international technology corporation results of operations continued being spent for actual remediation 
the ultimate impact of the proposed changes will depend upon a number of factors  including the overall strength of the us economy and customers views on the cost effectiveness of remedies available under the changed regulations 
approximately of it s revenues in both fiscal years and were derived from large  complex thermal remediation contracts utilizing the company s htts thermal treatment technology 
incineration as an allowable remedy under cercla continues to come under legislative and regulatory pressures 
if policies were implemented or regulations were changed such that the company was unable to permit and use thermal treatment on remediation projects due to either regulatory or market factors  the company would have to find alternative uses for its htts equipment 
if alternative uses  such as foreign installations  were not found or were uneconomical  there could be a negative effect to the company due to impairment of htts assets as well as lost project opportunities 
the company s backlog of contracts which utilize htts equipment was approximately  at march  the company is actively pursuing other contract opportunities which utilize the htts equipment 
at march   it s htts equipment had a net book value of approximately  in the quarter ended september   the company reduced the net book value by  of costs related to equipment specially constructed for the motco project which has been idle since ceasing work on the project 
see other income expense 
the company s total funded and unfunded backlog at march  was approximately   at march  including approximately  of contracted backlog scheduled to be completed during fiscal year and between  and  of additional project work expected to be defined and performed in fiscal year under existing governmental ido contracts 
backlog revenues are expected to be earned primarily over the next one to five years  with a substantial portion of the backlog consisting of governmental contracts  many of which are subject to annual funding and definition of project scope 
the backlog amounts at march  and march  include  and  respectively  of future work the company estimates it will receive based on historical experience under existing ido programs 
in accordance with industry practices  substantially all of the company s contracts are subject to cancellation  delay or modification by the customer 
backlog at march  does not include a  award to it in may of the savannah total environmental restoration contract ido program by the us army corps of engineers 
the company s backlog at any given time is subject to changes in scope of services required by the contracts leading to increases or decreases in backlog amounts 
the increased volume of contracts performed subject to such scope changes has also increased the number of contract claims requiring negotiations with clients in the ordinary course of business

the federal budget authorization delay and regulatory uncertainties discussed above are putting increased pressure on the company s business 
although funding trends under dod contracts have recently improved and the company has been awarded several new  large contracts in april and may  it expects to report a net loss after preferred stock dividends of between  and  or and per share  for the first fiscal quarter ending june  on revenues of approximately  based on recent trends  revenues are expected to progressively increase from first quarter levels during the remainder of fiscal year gross margin gross margins were  and of revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
excluding a  provision for major litigation in fiscal year see notes to consolidated financial statements commitments and contingencies central garden  gross margin would have declined from of revenues in fiscal year to in fiscal year  primarily because of the combination of the declining level of revenues  lower pricing due to competitive industry conditions and a shift in revenue mix toward lower margin subcontracted work 
after international technology corporation results of operations continued adjustment for the litigation provision  gross margin increased to of revenues in fiscal year from in fiscal year due to the favorable impact of higher staff utilization and productivity gains experienced in fiscal year and the negative impact on fiscal year gross margin of the analytical services business  which experienced a gross margin percentage of of revenues due to weak customer demand and decreased utilization of laboratory capacity 
the company s ability to maintain its gross margins is heavily dependent on increasing utilization of professional staff  properly executing projects  and successfully bidding new contracts at adequate margin levels 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company experienced a decline in gross margin percentage to of revenues due to the significant decrease in revenues discussed above 
gross margin percentage has been and in the upcoming quarters is expected to continue to be impacted by reduced revenues since certain overhead cost elements are fixed in the short term 
additionally  since the cost of htts equipment is generally recovered over three or more projects  gross margins are also dependent on winning new contracts utilizing existing htts equipment upon the completion of previous projects  otherwise  depreciation on htts equipment idle for significant periods of time will negatively affect gross margin
