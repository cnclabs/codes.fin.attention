the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales in overview continued is primarily due to the inclusion of promptus products that generate higher margins than lan magnetics based components 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales due to the inclusion of promptus products whose rate of spending was disproportionately high in relation to its sales 
additionally  operating profit was adversely affected by promptus products operating loss of approximately  and certain severance costs 
net income was also negatively impacted by the company s recording of an estimated loss on the combined disposal of both the e group and esco during the fourth quarter of sales change change sales    the increase in consolidated sales of  in from is primarily a result of the inclusion of promptus products effective january   and continued strong unit demand an increase of from the prior year for valor products lan magnetics based components 
the year over year sales growth in valor products is a result of increased unit volume of signal management products such as filters and transformers 
during  valor products did not experience significant average selling price erosion as experienced during the increase in sales in from of  was due to overall market growth and strong demand for valor products 
however  due to competitive pressures  valor products sales were negatively impacted by a sharp decline in average selling prices 
the decline in average selling prices was offset by an increase in unit volume of approximately 
international sales continue to remain strong during increasing  representing of the company s sales compared to in the increase in international sales is a result of the inclusion of promptus products and an increase in valor products to customers outside of the united states 
sales by major product change change valor products    percentage of total sales promptus products    percentage of total sales valor products valor products sales increased in and  when compared to  principally due to overall market growth and strong unit demand for signal management products 
the growth in sales reflects increased unit volume across  substantially  all product families supplied to oems for lan and internetworking products 
in  unit volume continued to be strong with increasing demand by oems in the base t interface card market and the rapidly growing internetworking market for stackable hubs used in lan segmentation 
during  valor products did not experience significant average selling price erosion as experienced during in  compared to  the growth in sales was a result of significantly increased unit volumes offset by rapid erosion in average selling prices for filter products 
during  average selling prices for filter products decreased approximately while unit volume increased  when compared to international sales for valor products in were approximately  or  increasing to from and in and  respectively 
substantially all of the increase was a result of increased sales by valor products pacific rim operations to existing international oem customers 
collectively  two valor products oem customers accounted for of sales  while individually they represented and of sales  compared to and less than in the sales sales continued percentage from these and other oem customers has historically fluctuated and may continue to vary in future periods 
management believes that future sales concentration to these customers is likely to continue  consequently  such concentration may adversely affect both average selling prices and future sales growth 
promptus products promptus products sales increased in from and as a result of overall market growth of high speed  digital  network access products for videoconferencing 
the growth in sales reflects increased unit volume of nacs and network systems to video conferencing oems and large telecom customers 
during  promptus products experienced a decline in average selling prices for certain network system products 
these products experienced average selling price decreases of approximately from the prior year offset by unit volume increases of approximately 
international sales for promptus products represented approximately of sales in  an increase of from in substantially all of the increase was a result of higher sales to existing oem customers in europe 
collectively  two promptus products customers accounted for of sales while  individually  these customers accounted for and of sales 
management believes that future unit volume and sales concentration with these significant customers is likely to continue  consequently  such concentration may have an adverse affect on average selling prices  gross profit  and gross profit as a percentage of sales 
cost of goods sold change change cost of goods sold    percentage of sales gross profit    percentage of sales the year over year increase in gross margin in absolute dollars is a result of increased unit volumes and the inclusion of promptus products effective january  gross profit as a percentage of sales increased in from but decreased from the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales in is primarily due to the inclusion of promptus products that generate higher margins than lan magnetics based components 
additionally  valor products gross margins increased from the prior period as a result of stabilized product pricing  particularly for filter products  reduced manufacturing costs  and increased unit volume 
cost of goods sold by major product change change valor products    percentage of sales gross profit    percentage of sales promptus products    percentage of sales gross profit    percentage of sales cost of goods sold continued valor products the year over year increase in gross profit in absolute dollars is a result of increased unit volumes 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales of from is a result of stabilized product average selling prices  particularly filter products  reduced raw material costs per unit  reduced manufacturing costs  and  to a lesser extent  economies of scale associated with increased manufacturing volumes 
during  manufacturing costs increased as a result of valor products adding two assembly facilities to meet demand for higher volume products 
further  these products were subject to sharp declines in average selling prices during based on the current fixed cost structure associated with maintaining the current manufacturing capacity to produce significant volume efficiently and if actual volumes manufactured are significantly less  the actual cost per unit and gross margins could be adversely affected 
promptus products the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of sales of approximately is primarily a result of reduced  average selling prices of network system products sold to one oem customer 
management believes that future unit volume and sales concentration with this significant oem customer is likely to continue  consequently  such concentration may have an adverse affect on average selling prices  gross profit  and gross profit as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses change change selling  general and administrative expenses    percentage of sales during  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars is due to the inclusion of promptus products effective january   the inclusion of goodwill amortization expense of associated with the promptus acquisition  increased selling costs associated with valor products higher sales volume  and a nonrecurring  one time charge of approximately  relating to certain severance costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of sales  during is a result of promptus products selling  marketing  and engineering spending that is disproportionately high in relation to its sales and the inclusion of nonrecurring  one time charges of certain severance costs 
in  the approximate  increase in spending is primarily a result of increased selling costs associated with higher sales and increased costs associated with product development and investments in additional people and systems to support valor products geographically disbursed  worldwide operations 
selling  general and administrative expense by major product change change valor products    percentage of sales promptus products    percentage of sales selling  general and administrative expenses continued valor products during  the increase in valor products selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars  as compared to and  is primarily a result of increased selling costs associated with higher selling volume 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales is a result of administrative efficiencies in relation to sales growth and a decrease in selling costs as a percentage of sales 
in  the increase in spending in absolute dollars was related to higher selling costs commensurate with the increase in sales 
selling  general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales for were essentially identical to those in management believes that selling  general and administrative expenses may vary as a percentage of future sales 
promptus products during  the increase in promptus products selling  general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars  as compared to and  is primarily associated with the increase in personnel costs in the sales  marketing  and engineering infrastructure 
these investments in sales and support personnel and new product development were made to support anticipated future sales growth 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for and  as compared to  are a result of significant  year over year  sales growth 
the company believes that promptus products selling  general and administrative expense may continue to vary as a percentage of future sales until promptus products generates and sustains a base of sales sufficient to support the current and future level of spending 
non operating income and expense change change non operating income expense  net percentage of sales non operating income expense  net  consists primarily of interest income and expense and net foreign currency translation costs 
the decrease in interest income  net  from is primarily a result of increased interest expense related to significant bank borrowings associated with the promptus acquisition and increased borrowings on the credit facility to facilitate growth in valor products and promptus products 
in december  the company used the proceeds of million from the e group disposal to repay million outstanding on the million  bank term loan and a significant portion of the credit facility  both of which were originally used in connection with the promptus acquisition 
provision for income taxes change change provision for income taxes  percentage of sales effective tax rate provision for income taxes continued a significant portion of valor products operations resides in foreign countries with lower tax rates than the united states 
these foreign operations generated a significant portion of the company s total earnings in   and  and account for the significantly lower  effective income tax rate than the statutory united states corporate income tax rate 
additionally  the company did not benefit from promptus s operating loss during management believes the company s future effective tax rate could fluctuate based on the geographic origin of valor products earnings and promptus s future financial performance 
income from continuing operations change change income from continuing operations    percentage of sales earnings per share the decrease in income from continuing operations is primarily due to the inclusion of promptus products financial results effective january   and the charges to income for certain severance costs 
the dilutive effect of promptus products operating loss  net of minority interest income and including the goodwill amortization expense  was approximately  or approximately per share of common stock 
the promptus products dilution excludes acquisition related interest expense and the issuance of  common shares in january income from discontinued operations  net change change income from discontinued operations   income from discontinued operations per share the decrease in income from discontinued operations in  as compared to and  is due to esco s operating loss offset by increased e group profitability 
subsequent to december  esco has not incurred any operating losses 
loss on disposal of discontinued operations change change loss on disposal of discontinued operations  loss on disposal of discontinued operations per share the loss on disposal of the discontinued operations is a result of a gain on disposal of the e group of approximately million  net of income taxes  and an estimated loss on disposal of esco of million  net of income tax benefits 
the net loss of  or per share on disposal of both discontinued operations is primarily due to increased income tax provision and a lower selling price for esco than management originally estimated 
the company does not anticipate recognizing an additional loss on disposal of the discontinued businesses 
net income and net income per share change change net income    net income per share net income and net income per share of common stock decreased in  as compared to  due to the operating loss of promptus products  certain severance and management costs  decreased income from discontinued operations  and a loss on disposal of discontinued operations offset by valor products increased profitability 
the decrease in these same measures in from is due to valor products decreased profitability 
prospective information the company believes that its future operating results will be influenced by a number of factors including  but not limited to  general economic conditions  the continued growth of the lan  internetworking  and videoconferencing markets  timely new product introductions  dependence on key oem customers  market acceptance of the new networking technologies  videoconferencing and desktop videoconferencing  the future operating and financial performance of valor products and promptus products  and numerous competitive forces 
it is anticipated that the company s operating results in the foreseeable future will remain dependent on the success of valor products in identifying  developing  manufacturing  and marketing new products or enhancing existing product offerings and promptus products ability to expand its customer base  reduce reliance on significant oem customers  and identify  develop  manufacture  and market new products 
the company is subject to technological changes  which could cause management to reassess its estimate of the realizability of goodwill and or its amortization period 
the company s future operating results will also depend on the growth of broad band  global services and high speed  digital  network applications 
promptus s growth will depend on several factors including  but not limited to  the deployment and expansion of switched digital services and the related market for isdn customer premise equipment  the effectiveness of marketing activities  and expansion of its product line and customer base as well as the ability to compete effectively in the videoconferencing access market and in applications other than videoconferencing 
the promptus acquisition required significant capital and equity investments as well as investments in the sales  marketing  and product development infrastructure 
since promptus product s sales are currently disproportionate with these investments  promptus is likely to continue to be dilutive to net income in the near term 
it will continue to be dilutive unless  and until  promptus is able to significantly increase sales and profitability 
the majority of valor products sales continue to be derived from products that support ethernet and base t applications 
valor products operating results could be affected if there is an unexpected change in such technologies or if valor does not respond appropriately to expected changes 
valor products are supplying oems product compliant with all relevant ieee  ansi  and atm forum standards for base tx fast ethernet  tp pmd fddi over copper  and mbps atm applications 
the success of these new products is dependent on many factors  such as the company s ability to manufacture these products in sufficient quantities to meet anticipated demand and the overall market acceptance of these new technologies 
the inability of these advanced networking modes to gain market acceptance or potential delays of the widespread installation of such products could subject valor products existing products to increased competition and pricing pressures  which would adversely affect the company s operating results 
the company s future performance will also be affected by the volume  mix  and timing of orders received during a particular quarterly period 
the company s backlog at the beginning of any particular quarter is not sufficient to achieve expected sales or profitability for that quarter 
to achieve its sales and profitability objectives in a quarter  the company is dependent upon obtaining substantial prospective information continued orders in that quarter for shipment during that quarter 
there can be no assurance that orders from existing customers will continue at the levels of previous years or that the company will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
additionally  there can be no assurance that orders received and requested for shipment in a specific quarter will not be canceled or the requested date of shipment changed to a subsequent quarter 
if anticipated orders do not develop or changes in delivery schedules or cancellation of orders occur  the per unit manufacturing costs  expenditures  and inventory levels could be disproportionately high in relation to sales 
this could have an adverse affect on the company s operating results for that quarterly period 
there is one key component that valor products use in its manufacturing and assembly process that is currently available only from a single source 
there can be no assurance that this supplier will be able to meet future demand for components in a timely and cost effective manner 
the company s operating results and customer relationships could be adversely affected by either price increases or an interruption or reduction in products shipped due to an interruption or reduction in supply of any key components 
the company s future earnings and stock price have been  and may continue to be  subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
any shortfall in sales or earnings could have an immediate and significant adverse affect on the trading price of the company s common stock in any given quarterly period 
because of the factors mentioned above  as well as other factors  historical operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of future financial performance 
in december  a class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court  southern district of california  against the company and certain of its officers and directors alleging violations of the securities exchange act of specifically  the complaint asserts  among other claims  that the company artificially inflated the value of its stock by making false and misleading statements about expected financial results 
the plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages based upon the decrease in market value of the company s stock 
the company has filed its initial response to the complaint and intends to defend this action vigorously 
based upon its present understanding of the facts  the company believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims alleged 
because the outcome of the claims are uncertain at this time  no provision for any liability that may result upon adjudication has been made in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents  and available borrowings on the domestic and foreign credit facilities 
on december    and  cash and cash equivalents totaled million  million  and million  respectively 
net cash provided used by continuing operations was million  million  and million  respectively 
cash used by continuing operations improved approximately million in  as compared to  as a result of increased depreciation and amortization expense and increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities offset by reduced profitability and increased accounts receivable  inventories  and other assets 
the increase in depreciation and amortization is due to the inclusion of promptus s goodwill amortization during and a full year of depreciation for valor products capital expenditures during the increase in inventories and accounts payable is due to increased unit volume and continued growth in valor products and promptus products 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to increased sales during the fourth quarter of  when compared to the fourth quarter of  for both valor products and promptus products 
the average collection period remained stable in  when compared to and liquidity and capital resources continued the company made capital expenditures of approximately million during  a significant portion of which was expended by valor products for additional equipment to support increased manufacturing volume 
the remaining portion was expended by promptus products for increased test equipment  computer equipment  and furnishings for the increase in personnel and new product development 
during  valor products capital expenditures of million were primarily used to add one new assembly plant and one new subcontractor operation in china 
the company currently estimates its capital expenditures to be approximately million  substantially  all of which will be invested in valor products 
the company anticipates that all capital expenditures will be funded through cash generated from operations 
in january  concurrent with the company s acquisition of promptus  the company utilized the million  five year term note  approximately million on the million  domestic credit facility  and proceeds of million net of issuance costs from the issuance of  shares of common stock of which  were treasury shares 
in december  the total cash proceeds of million from the disposal of the e group were used to repay the outstanding principal and interest on the million  bank term loan of million 
the remaining proceeds were used to pay down the domestic credit facility 
the remaining e group selling price of is composed of a note receivable due in with interest due semi annually and an escrow amount the escrow funds of the escrow funds are subject to certain purchase price adjustments  if any  by the buyer 
currently  management does not anticipate any such adjustments to the purchase price 
the escrow funds will remain in escrow until june  at which time  if no purchase price adjustment occurs  all escrow funds will be remitted to the company 
in february  the company used the total cash proceeds of million from the disposal of esco to pay down existing indebtedness on the domestic credit facility 
the remaining esco selling price of million is composed of a note receivable due in equal  semi annual installments plus interest commencing in august and ending august the company is currently satisfying all working capital and capital expenditure requirements through internally generated cash flow from operations and borrowings available on its domestic and foreign credit facilities 
management believes that its financial position  future earnings  and available borrowings on its domestic and foreign credit facilities will be sufficient to finance working capital and estimated capital expenditures at least through dividends on the company s  shares of outstanding  cumulative convertible preferred stock accrue at a rate of per share  per year  payable quarterly 
in  dividends totaling were paid 
in connection with the acquisition of promptus  the company entered into an agreement for the contingent purchase of the remaining million shares or approximately of promptus s capital stock 
the first mutual put call right occurs january for of the remaining promptus shares 
the price to be paid will be based upon a predetermined formula using forecast and actual results of promptus in   and because of the determinants  it is not presently possible to assess whether the condition for this contingent purchase will be satisfied nor is it possible to estimate the price at which such shares might be purchased 
in the event the mutual put call right is exercised  the company will be obligated to pay up to per share in cash and may pay the amount in excess of in cash  common stock  or a combination thereof
