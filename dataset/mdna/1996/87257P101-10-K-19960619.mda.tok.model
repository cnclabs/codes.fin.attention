item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations since  the principal line of business has been that of a domestic onshore drilling contractor 
in  the company began acquiring and participating in the exploration for oil and gas reserves 
contract drilling operations 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s contract drilling operations years ended march  in thousands  except s contract drilling revenues    contract drilling expenses    operating costs as a percent of revenues rig utilization contract drilling revenues increased for the year ended march  by approximately 
the company has experienced an increased demand for turnkey contracts 
during fiscal year  the company drilled turnkey wells which represents of total drilling revenues  compared to in fiscal year  which represents of total drilling revenues 
operating costs as a percent of revenues have remained relatively constant as has the company s rig utilization rates 
oil and gas operations 
the following table sets forth certain information relating to the company s oil and gas operations years ended march  in thousands oil and gas revenues   production expenses dry holes and abandonments depreciation  depletion and amortization writedown of properties  oil and gas revenues have increased by approximately and for the years ended march  and  respectively 
this increase is primarily a result of an increase in the number of wells in which the company has an ownership interest 
accordingly  the related oil and gas production expenses increased by and  respectively 
the company participated as a working interest owner in the drilling of wells during  of which were dry holes 
the company participated in the drilling of wells in  of which were dry holes 
during  the company recognized a non cash charge of approximately million due to a writedown of the carrying value of its oil and gas properties 
this charge was a result of the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas requires the company to assess the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of oil and gas properties on a property by property basis in contrast to the company s prior policy of evaluating the undiscounted future net revenues of its oil and gas properties in total 
according to sfas  if an impairment is indicated based on undiscounted future cash flows  then it is recognized to the extent that net capitalized costs exceed discounted future cash flows 
income taxes at march   the company had approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards nols for tax purposes 
if these carryforwards are not utilized  they will begin to expire in the company utilizes an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
the company has a deferred tax asset primarily due to net operating loss carryforwards 
the company has provided a valuation allowance for the entire balance of deferred tax assets as it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
see note to the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s operating results are directly related to the level of drilling activity conducted by oil and gas companies in the company s areas of operation 
as a result of the present worldwide excess supply of crude oil and natural gas and higher domestic finding costs on an equivalent unit basis  producers have significantly reduced their domestic drilling budgets 
this decreased demand coupled with the extreme competitive conditions prevalent in the contract drilling industry continue to challenge the company to maximize on available opportunities while exercising caution 
on january   the company entered into a loan agreement with norwest bank texas  midland  na norwest that provides for a  revolving line of credit secured by the company s drilling rigs and related equipment  accounts receivable and inventory 
borrowings under the line of credit bear interest at the norwest bank minnesota  national association base rate 
interest only is payable monthly 
the loans mature january   at which time  the then outstanding principal and accrued interest is due and payable 
at march   the company had borrowed  under the facility 
the company intends to meet its cash flow requirements for fiscal through cash flow provided from operations and additional borrowings 
cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended march  compared to million for the year ended march  the company expended approximately million in cash during the year ended march  for asset acquisitions  including 
million for a national drilling rig with a depth capacity of  feet  and an additional 
million in related drilling equipment 
the remaining million was invested in oil and gas exploration projects 
net working capital was a negative  for the year ended march  compared to  for the year ended march  the company has entered into turnkey drilling contracts which create substantially more economic risk to the company than footage or daywork contracts 
under a turnkey contract  the company contracts to drill a well to a specified depth and bears the risk of loss to that depth 
typically  turnkey contracts are more profitable than footage or daywork contracts  but  the company could experience substantial losses if drilling problems occur under its turnkey contracts 
the company believes it owns a sufficient number of drilling rigs to remain a viable drilling contractor in its location 
however  the cash flow generated from operations will continue to be directly affected by the drilling activity in the company s areas of operations 
the company is still subject to considerable uncertainty due to the instability of oil and gas prices  decreased demand for contract drilling services and the intense competition prevalent in the contract drilling industry
