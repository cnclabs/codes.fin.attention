item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is engaged in the exploration  development and production of natural gas and oil  primarily in conjunction with the drilling programs it sponsors and manages 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from turnkey drilling  well operations  gas gathering  transportation and gas marketing services performed under contract with the drilling programs 
during the last three fiscal years the drilling programs received  from the sale of partnership interests to non industry investors 
this funding  together with the company s contributions to the drilling programs  has resulted in the addition of drilling program wells from fiscal year through fiscal year several factors may affect the amount of the company s revenues with respect to the activities of the drilling programs 
the amount of funds raised by each drilling program determines the number of wells for which the company receives drilling revenues 
the company continually monitors the cost incurred in drilling  completion and production operations and reviews its turnkey contract prices for each drilling program in order to reduce the risk of unprofitable drilling operations to the company and the economic considerations of the investors in the drilling programs 
the turnkey drilling contract price between the drilling programs and the company may vary among drilling programs depending on competition and other cost factors and the returns sought by investors in the drilling programs 
the company s capital availability  as well as revenue and profit considerations  may result in the company changing its interest percentage in future drilling programs 
the company s continued growth depends on a number of factors  including its continued ability to raise drilling program funds from non industry investors to increase the number of wells from which the company will receive production  contract drilling and service related revenues and the company s ability to maintain adequate liquidity to provide its contributions to new drilling programs and to acquire additional proved undeveloped or proved producing properties 
the company s growth is also dependent on several external factors  including the price at which gas  and to a lesser extent oil  can be found and sold 
the drilling activity and acquisition of oil and gas properties resulted in an increase in the company s proved developed natural gas reserves to  mcf for fiscal from  mcf for fiscal while proved developed oil reserves decreased to  barrels from  barrels  respectively 
the increase in future net revenues undiscounted from  for fiscal to  for fiscal for the net proved developed reserves was due to increased natural gas prices received at march  as compared to the natural gas price received at march  the company produced  mcf of gas from proved developed reserves while adding  mcf through the drilling of new wells 
during fiscal  the company adopted a methodology of only recognizing as proved undeveloped reserves the potential oil and gas which can reasonably be expected to be recovered from drillable locations which the company owned or had rights to at fiscal year end which are offsetting locations to wells that have indicated commercial production in the objective formation and which the company fully expects to drill in the very near future 
this methodology  coupled with the determination that certain proved undeveloped leasehold acreage no longer fit the company s long term development plans at the current price or development cost  and was either released or re categorized to possible or probable reserves  resulted in a downward revision of proved reserves by  mcf 
although the mcfs were revised downward  the reduction in development costs for undeveloped acreage more than offset the reduction in reserve value 
proved oil reserves decrease from  barrels at march  to  barrels at march  as extensions and discoveries including purchases of  barrels were offset by production of  barrels  sales of  barrels as contributions of undeveloped acreage to drilling programs and downward revisions of proved undeveloped leasehold acreage amounting to  barrels 
the decrease in proved oil reserves was primarily due to the determination that certain proved undeveloped leasehold acreage no longer fit the company s development plans at the current price or development cost and was either re categorized or released 
changes in the standardized measure of future net cash flows are set forth in note of the company s financial statements 
the above mentioned additions and sales of natural gas coupled with the development costs associated with undeveloped acreage create timing differences which are reflected in the other category of the standardized measure 
of the company s total proved reserves  approximately are proved developed and approximately are proved undeveloped based upon equivalent unit mcfs 
proved undeveloped acreage requires considerable capital expenditures to develop 
management of the company believes that a significant percentage of the proved undeveloped reserves should be recovered in future years  although no assurance of such recovery can be given 
the following table is a review of the results of operations of the company for the fiscal years ended march   and all items in the table are calculated as a percentage of total revenues 
revenues oil and gas production drilling revenues well operating  transportation and other administrative  management and agency fees other total revenues expenses oil and gas production expenses drilling costs oil and gas operations general and administrative expenses depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment and other abandonment of oil and gas properties provision credit for income taxes other total expenses net income loss the following discussion and analysis reviews the results of operations and financial condition for the company for the years ended march   and this review should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and other financial data presented elsewhere herein 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues oil and gas production revenues remained relatively constant between fiscal and fiscal production revenues were effected by relatively low gas prices during the company s first three quarters  although  gas prices increased substantially during the company s fourth quarter due to the generally colder weather conditions  resulting in increased demand 
production also has been adversely affected by the continued rework on the company s gulf coast properties  but increased oil production and gas production from the company s acquisition and drilling of appalachian wells offset the gulf coast production decline 
for fiscal  the company received an average price of per barrel of oil and per mcf of natural gas compared to an average price of per barrel of oil and per mcf of natural gas received during fiscal drilling revenues decreased by  for fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the decrease in the amount of funds raised from drilling programs as well as the timing of the formation of the drilling program  the commencement and completion of drilling activities and the number of wells recognized in revenue and the type of wells drilled 
drilling revenues were recognized on wells for fiscal compared to wells for fiscal at march   the company had additional wells as yet not recognized in revenues as compared to wells at march  the company s shallow wells range in depth from feet to feet  for which the company generally charges a lower turnkey drilling contract price compared to deeper gas wells ranging from feet to feet 
during fiscal the company formed two drilling programs and raised investor funds of  as compared to three drilling programs with investor funds of  during fiscal the first drilling program of fiscal was formed forty five days later than the first drilling program of fiscal  thereby delaying the number of wells completed and the recognition of revenue for the fiscal year 
well operating  transportation and other revenues for fiscal decreased  compared to fiscal primarily due to a  decline in unaffiliated third party gas sales 
the company reduced the number of low margin third party gas transactions in favor of focusing its gas marketing department on its proprietary gas sales during the period of low natural gas prices 
although the company actively pursues these sales  the amount of third party gas sales may vary materially from year to year 
revenue from administrative  management and agency fees  which are based on a percentage of the total investor capital raised in all of the drilling programs  increased by  for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to the formation of the drilling programs in fiscal coupled with the ongoing administrative fees accrued from the fiscal drilling programs 
expenses oil and gas production expenses increased  for fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to costs associated with reworking two wells in the gulf coast area and costs associated with the production enhancement program on the wells the company acquired in december the company was successful in reworking one gulf coast area well while the results of the second well will not be known until the first or second quarter of fiscal drilling costs for fiscal compared to fiscal decreased  due to the decrease in the number of wells completed between comparable periods 
however  the profit margin on drilling revenues increased from for fiscal to for fiscal the increase in the drilling profit margin is due to lower drilling costs associated with the average depth of the company s upper devonian and clinton medina wells and improved cost controls for wells currently recognized in revenue compared to the prior period 
the company s upper devonian and clinton medina wells averaged  feet in depth for fiscal compared to an average of  feet in depth for fiscal the company also reduced its interest in the fiscal drilling programs to  as compared to in the fiscal drilling programs  and increased the turnkey drilling price the company receives thereby effecting the company s profit margin 
oil and gas operations expense decreased  in fiscal compared to fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in unaffiliated third party gas purchases related to third party gas sales as discussed above 
depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment and other increased  in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the company s implementation of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company routinely reviews its long lived assets for impairment  although sfas no 
required a different grouping of assets which caused an impairment for the period 
at march  the company s impairment of oil and gas properties and leases due to the accounting change was  the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
requires the cumulative effect of the accounting change to be reported in net income in the year of adoption 
abandonment of oil and gas properties decreased  in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  the company abandoned a deep zone in two wells associated with its drilling on acreage acquired in the purchase of wells in western pennsylvania 
the company  in conjunction with its drilling programs  at march  has completed one of the wells in a shallower formation and anticipates the completion of the second well in the first fiscal quarter of interest expense increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal this increase was associated with the company s additional borrowings on its reducing revolving credit facility  the placement of a private debt financing with nagit usa  a principal shareholder of the company  and an increase in the prime interest rate 
at march    was outstanding under the company s credit facility  as compared to  at march  net operating loss of  for fiscal compares to net operating income of  for fiscal the increase in the operating loss was due primarily to the increase in depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment and other which resulted from the accounting change promulgated by the financial accounting standard board causing an impairment of oil and gas properties and leases of  without the affect of the impairment of oil and gas properties the company s fiscal net operating loss would have been a net operating income of  net income of  for fiscal decreased during fiscal to a net loss of  due primarily to the impairment of the company s oil and gas properties and leases coupled with the lower net drilling income recognized and high interest expense 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues oil and gas production revenues decreased  to  for fiscal as compared to  for the prior corresponding period 
natural gas production was relatively constant between years with a slight decrease in oil production 
the decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to an average decrease in gas prices of and a decline in oil production from the company s louisiana properties resulting from reworking of wells throughout fiscal for fiscal the company received an average price of per barrel of oil and per mcf of natural gas compared to an average price of per barrel of oil and per mcf of natural gas received during fiscal drilling revenues increased by  as a result of the increased drilling activity 
the company utilizes the completed contract method to recognize revenue on drilling contracts 
under this method  drilling revenues are recognized on wells when they are deemed to be substantially complete 
for fiscal the company recognized revenue on wells as compared to wells in fiscal this increase in the number of wells completed along with an increase in the company s turnkey price resulted in increased drilling revenues 
well operating  transportation and other revenues for fiscal increased  as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased gas sales made to third parties of  in fiscal as compared to sales of  in fiscal revenue from administrative  management and agency fees  which are based on a percentage of the total investor capital raised in all of the drilling programs  increased by  for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due to the additional drilling programs 
expenses drilling costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal increased  primarily due to the increased number of wells completed in the recent period 
the profit margin on drilling revenue decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal general and administrative expenses decreased  for fiscal as compared to fiscal a larger decrease was offset somewhat by management s decision to withdraw its registration statement on form s resulting in additional expense of approximately  in associated costs in fiscal the company retained certain capitalized costs incurred with the registration statement at march  depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment and other increased  for fiscal as compared to fiscal this increase was due to increased depreciation resulting from the company s capital investment for gas gathering lines for new wells  depreciation of company vehicles and amortization of costs associated with the credit facility 
the company continues to capitalize certain costs associated with its drilling programs resulting in an increased depreciable basis of its investment 
consequently  depreciation  depletion  amortization  impairment and other has increased in conjunction with increased drilling program activity in fiscal abandonment of oil and gas properties increased   due primarily to a larger amount of the company s jurmonville acreage abandoned during fiscal as compared to fiscal interest expense increased from  for fiscal to  for fiscal this increase is primarily associated with higher borrowings under the credit facility in order to fund a portion of the company s additional investments in fiscal year drilling programs 
at march    was outstanding under the company s credit facility  as compared to  at march  net income for fiscal of  compares to  for fiscal the decrease in net income for fiscal resulted primarily from a decrease in oil and gas production revenues attributable to the decrease in the average price received for its gas 
in addition  net income was decreased by the increase in interest expense due to the company s additional borrowings in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
inflation and changes in prices while the costs of operations have been and will continue to be affected by inflation  oil and gas prices have fluctuated during recent years and generally have not followed the same pattern as inflation 
with today s global economy  especially in the area of oil and natural gas  management believes that other forces of the economy and world events  such as opec  the weather  economic factors  and the effects of supply of natural gas in the united states and regionally have a more immediate effect on current pricing than inflation 
the company received an average price of and per barrel for fiscal and  respectively  and and per mcf for natural gas for fiscal and  respectively 
the general market for natural gas in the appalachian basin has remained weak for a longer period than the company previously anticipated  however  gas prices have increased approximately in the company s last quarter of fiscal due to the colder appalachian area weather 
the reasons for the continued weak natural gas prices and recent increases in the gas prices can be attributed to supply and demand fluctuations caused by the weather sensitive nature of the industry 
although it is anticipated that there will be a decline in gas prices during the summer months compared to the winter of the demand for gas by storage facilities may continue to keep gas prices above last year s low prices 
other variables potentially effecting gas prices are increased competition from canadian gas  effects of gas storage and possibly federal energy regulatory commission ferc order the ferc order may have contributed to the lower spot market prices by mandating an unbundling of pipeline service and allowing open access to a variety of geographical markets 
management cannot predict what long term effects ferc order will have on either spot market prices or longer term gas contracts 
currently  the company sells natural gas under both fixed price contracts and on the spot market 
the spot market price the company receives for gas production is related to several variables  including the weather and the effects of gas storage 
the company anticipates that spot market prices will continue to fluctuate in response to various factors  primarily weather and market conditions 
in an effort to position itself to take advantage of future increases in demand for natural gas  the company continues to construct new pipeline systems in the appalachian basin and to contract with other pipeline systems in the region to transport natural gas production from company wells 
liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital was negative  at march  compared to negative  at march  the increase of  in working capital from march  reflects the company s use of cash to purchase property and equipment to meet its obligations to fund its investments in the drilling programs 
also  the company s current accounts receivable related to federal income taxes increased during the year ended march  an amendment to the credit facility increased the company s borrowing base to  after adjustment for outstanding letters of credit at march  as of march   the company had  outstanding under its credit facility 
north coast s current ratio was 
to at march  and 
to at march  the following table summarizes the company s financial position at march  and amounts in thousands amount amount working capital property and equipment   other total   long term debt   deferred income taxes stockholders equity   total   capital resources and requirements the oil and gas exploration and development activities of north coast historically have been financed through the drilling programs  through internally generated funds  and from bank financing 
the following table summarizes the company s statements of cash flows for the years ended march   and amounts in thousands dollars dollars dollars net cash provided by operating activities    net cash used for investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities   increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents  all items in the previous table are calculated as a percentage of total cash sources 
total cash sources include the following items  if positive cash flow from operations before working capital changes  changes in working capital  net cash provided by investing activities and net cash provided by financing activities  plus any decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
as the above table indicates  the company s cash flow provided by operating activities decreased approximately  for fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease is due to the reduced amount of funds raised in drilling programs  resulting in reduced drilling activity and lower profits 
net cash used for investing activities decreased from  of cash sources for fiscal to  of cash sources for fiscal the decrease of  was due to the company s purchase of certain oil and gas interests in fiscal in western pennsylvania compared to small individual purchases of working interests in fiscal in addition  the company s investment in tangible equipment and gas gathering lines for drilling programs were reduced in fiscal  compared to fiscal  due to the reduced number of wells drilled  the timing and amount of funds raised in drilling programs and the reduced investment in tangibles resulting from drilling shallower wells 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by  from fiscal to fiscal this decrease reflects the sale of stock in fiscal without a corresponding sale of stock in fiscal coupled with a decrease in overall borrowings between the comparable periods 
on september  the company entered into an agreement with an affiliate of its lender to provide a reducing revolving line of credit of up to  the credit facility 
the credit facility as amended for borrowing base adjustments provided the company with available future borrowings of  after adjustment for outstanding letters of credit at march  based upon the company s financial position and level of oil and natural gas and pipeline based reserves  with available borrowings reducing  at the first of each month 
available borrowings also are subject to reduction based upon the amount of outstanding letters of credit used to support certain bonding requirements  as of march  
the credit facility provides that availability is subject to adjustment based upon the company s semi annual reserve study and is subject to certain covenants see note to the company s march  financial statements 
as of march   the company had  outstanding under the credit facility 
at march  the company was in violation of its stockholders equity loan covenant  although this violation has been waived by the lender 
amounts borrowed under the credit facility bear interest at the lending bank s prime rate plus 
also  at march   the company had approximately  outstanding under a mortgage note payable 
the mortgage note bears interest at the rate of and requires the company to make monthly payments of approximately  through july also  subsequent to year end the company purchased a building for its headquarters and entered into a mortgage note on may  for  over year term with an interest rate of to be renegotiated every five years 
the amounts borrowed under its reducing revolving line of credit are secured by the company s receivables  inventory  equipment and a first mortgage on certain of the company s interests in oil and gas wells and reserves 
the mortgage notes are secured by certain land and buildings 
in addition to bank financing  the company secured  in financing from nagit  a principal stockholder of the company  relating to the purchase of certain producing wells  gas gathering lines and drilling locations 
the amounts outstanding under the terms of the company s financing arrangements with nagit are subordinated to the prior payment and amounts outstanding under the company s credit facility  and bear an interest rate at the prime rate designated by the chemical bank  na  plus at march  
this agreement grants nagit an overriding royalty interest in the acquired properties 
repayment of the loan is in cash based upon a percentage of the net monthly revenues from the acquired properties 
also  effective june   the company entered into a loan agreement with nagit with respect to a loan of  the unsecured loan may be repaid in cash plus accrued interest with approval of the company s senior lender with the proceeds of a sale of equity securities or may be converted into shares of common stock at the rate of per share 
the loan is subordinate to the company s credit facility with its senior lender and bears interest at the rate of per annum 
as of march   the balance of the loan and accrued interest was  in connection with entering into the loan agreement  the company issued a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share and a warrant to purchase  shares of common stock at per share 
the warrants may be redeemed by the company for 
per share at its option upon days written notice 
the oil and gas industry is intensely capital driven and demands on the company s capital resources may increase further during fiscal the potential increases may result from additional drilling and completion obligations of the company relating to its sponsorship of drilling programs  further development of the company drilling prospects  the possibility of future joint ventures or other arrangements intended to assist in increasing the company s reserve base and production revenues and the dividend obligations associated with the company s preferred stock 
management of the company believes that internally generated funds and available borrowings under its credit facility will be sufficient to fund the company s anticipated capital expenditures as well as its working capital needs through the end of the current fiscal year 
during fiscal year  the company adhered to its plan of increasing drilling margins by adjusting both its percentage of ownership of the wells drilled by the drilling programs and the depths of these wells 
the improvement in drilling margins was a result of reduced drilling and completion costs and increasing per well drilling revenues 
although management has taken the steps outlined above  due to the amount of funds committed to current drilling programs and future projects  the uncertainties associated with the amount of funds which may be raised from investors in future drilling programs  and uncertainties associated with turnkey drilling costs and future production revenues  it may be necessary for the company to secure additional sources of capital or financing for its future projects and to fund its obligations 
in the event that available borrowings under the credit facility are not sufficient or if additional financing is needed and cannot be obtained  the company believes that it would be required to change its growth oriented business strategy to conserve cash 
in order to accomplish this objective  the company believes that it would be necessary to take various actions  including reducing the amount of capital raised in future drilling programs  the introduction of certain cost cutting measures and the possible sale of certain assets 
management of the company believes that measures of this type would have a material adverse effect on the company 
accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation which permits either recording the estimation value of stock based compensation over the applicable vesting period or disclosing the unrecorded cost and the related effect on earnings per share in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
is required to be adopted for financial statements with fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently reviewing the accounting standard and has not yet determined the effect  if any  on its financial statements
