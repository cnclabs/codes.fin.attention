international sales increased by million  or  to of net sales  excluding royalty income  in fiscal  compared to in the prior year  principally as a result of growth in shipments of multi lumen catheters and intra aortic balloon catheters 
the percentage of net sales attributable to the company s direct sales force increased in fiscal to approximately from approximately in fiscal  principally as a result of the company s gradual conversion of dealer based sales to direct sales 
this increase in net sales was lower than the company anticipated due to an unforeseen reduction in the rate of growth in the us market for certain high volume products  the strength of the us dollar  particularly against the japanese yen  and slower than anticipated new product introductions 
health care cost containment initiatives in the us have reduced growth in demand in markets where arrow has or greater market shares  and protecting that market share has affected the company s pricing in some instances 
the company anticipates that new sales and marketing strategies will result in increased us sales of several products in fiscal  however  us demand for certain of the company s core products is expected to remain sluggish 
the company also anticipates that demand in fiscal in international markets will continue to grow more rapidly than us sales as the company increases supply from its mexico and new czech republic production facilities and expands international marketing activity 
a return to the company s traditionally higher rates of sales growth is dependent on its new products now in various stages of development or market introduction  as well as timely receipt of required regulatory approvals and timely completion of late stage research and development programs 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit improved to in fiscal from in the prior year  due primarily to the reduction in manufacturing costs resulting from the company s new sterilization facility which does not require the use of freon gas  operating efficiencies created by increased production at the company s manufacturing facility in mexico and increased sales of higher margin arrowg ard trademark blue registered trademark antiseptic surface treated catheter products 
this increase was lower than the company anticipated due principally to the unfavorable impact of currency translations of foreign sales 
research  development and engineering expenses in fiscal increased by to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal these expenses increased primarily as a result of development expenses related to certain products of therex  which was acquired in april  and certain cardiac assist products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million during fiscal from million in the previous year  and increased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this percentage increase was due primarily to additions to the domestic direct sales force to replace a distributor in the new england area  the expansion of the company s japanese and european sales subsidiaries and the addition of expenses related to therex 
fiscal compared to fiscal continued principally due to the above factors  operating income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal other expenses income  net  increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal other expenses income  net  consists principally of interest expense and foreign exchange gains and losses associated with the company s direct sales subsidiaries  which resulted in a net loss in fiscal  compared to a net gain in the prior fiscal year  due to the increased strength of the us dollar 
as a result of the factors discussed above  income before income taxes decreased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal the effective income tax rate increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  principally as a result of generating a larger proportion of earnings in higher tax jurisdictions and the reduction in the benefit of the research and development tax credit prior to its reinstatement on july  net income in fiscal decreased by to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  net income represented in fiscal compared to in the previous year

sales of critical care products increased to million from million in fiscal sales of interventional procedure products increased to million from million in the previous year 
international sales increased by million  or  to of net sales  excluding royalty income  in fiscal  compared to in the prior year  principally as a result of growth in shipments of multi lumen catheters  the favorable impact of currency translations of foreign sales and sales of intra aortic balloon pumps and catheters 
the increase in international sales as a percentage of net sales was attributable principally to sales of intra aortic balloon pumps and catheters and faster growth in international sales  as compared to us sales  of the company s principal product lines 
the percentage of net sales attributable to the company s direct sales force increased in fiscal to approximately from approximately in fiscal  principally as a result of the company s gradual conversion of dealer based sales to direct sales 
gross profit increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  gross profit improved to in fiscal from in the prior year  due primarily to the favorable impact of currency translations of foreign sales and a more profitable product and distribution mix 
this impact was partially offset by higher sterilization costs resulting from the rising price of  and increasing excise tax imposed on  freon gas  which the company used in its ethylene oxide sterilization process 
the company s new sterilization facility that does not require the use of freon gas became operational in may because the company uses the first in  first out fifo method of inventory accounting  the company did not realize lower costs through the use of this facility until late in the fourth quarter of fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal continued research  development and engineering expenses in fiscal increased by to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal in july  the company amended its arrow fischell trademark pullback atherectomy catheter research and development and license agreements to modify the terms of payment of  and recognize as pre paid royalties  certain milestone payments thereunder 
these amendments have eliminated the need to make additional accruals toward these milestone payments under the research and development agreement 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million during fiscal from million in the previous year  and increased as a percentage of net sales to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this percentage increase was due primarily to the relocation and expansion of the company s sales offices and warehouse in japan  the unfavorable impact of currency translations of foreign subsidiary operating expenses  the addition of sales and marketing expenses related to the company s intra aortic balloon pump and catheter business  operating expenses related to arrow iberia  the company s direct sales subsidiary in spain  and the amortization of goodwill resulting from the company s acquisition of the intra aortic balloon pump and catheter business of kontron instruments 
principally due to the above factors  operating income increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal other expenses income  net  decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal other expenses income  net  consists principally of gains on foreign exchange transactions associated with the company s direct sales subsidiaries  which resulted in net gains in both periods  but were offset in fiscal and by interest expense of approximately million and million  respectively  on debt incurred primarily in connection with the acquisition of the company s intra aortic balloon pump and catheter business 
as a result of the factors discussed above  income before income taxes increased in fiscal by to million from million in fiscal the effective income tax rate was in both fiscal and fiscal net income in fiscal increased by to million from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  net income represented in fiscal compared to in the previous year

this increase was due primarily to changes in operating assets and liabilities 
accounts receivable increased by million for the year ended august   compared to an million increase in the prior year 
accounts receivable  measured in days sales outstanding  increased to days at august   from days at august   due principally to an increase in the collection period for the company s international sales 
net cash used in the company s investing activities increased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year  principally as a result of an increase of million in capital expenditures related to the construction and equipping of the company s new manufacturing and research facility in the czech republic  payment in december of the remaining million to cardiac pathways pursuant to an agreement to purchase for million preferred stock convertible into approximately of the then outstanding common stock of cardiac pathways  payment of a million pre paid royalty to cardiac pathways in december in exchange for certain distribution and manufacturing rights acquired by the company upon receipt of fda k marketing clearance in december for cardiac pathways trio ensemble trademark mapping catheter system and payment of million to microwave medical systems  inc in may for the purchase of certain technology related to the company s microwave ablation catheter program 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this change resulted principally from an increase in borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility  offset by repayments of long term debt 
as of august   the company had us bank credit facilities providing a total of million in available revolving credit for general business purposes  of which million remained unused 
in addition  certain of the company s foreign subsidiaries have revolving credit facilities totaling the us dollar equivalent of million  of which million remained unused as of august  combined borrowing under these credit facilities increased million and million during the years ended august  and  respectively 
during fiscal  and  the percentage of the company s sales invoiced in currencies other than the us dollar was  and  respectively 
in addition  a small part of the company s cost of goods sold is denominated in foreign currencies 
as a partial hedge against adverse fluctuations in exchange rates  the company periodically enters into foreign currency exchange contracts with certain major financial institutions 
by their nature  all such contracts involve risk  including the risk of nonperformance by counterparties 
accordingly  losses relating to these contracts could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
based upon the company s knowledge of the financial condition of the counterparties to its existing forward contracts  the company believes that it does not have any material exposure to any individual counterparty 
the company s policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
as of november   outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts totaling the us dollar equivalent of million mature at various dates through may the company expects to continue to utilize foreign currency exchange contracts to manage its exposure  although there can be no assurance that the company s efforts in this regard will be successful 
based upon its present plans  the company believes that its working capital  operating cash flow and available credit sources will be adequate to repay current portions of long term debt  to finance currently planned capital expenditures and to meet the currently foreseeable liquidity needs of the company 
during the periods discussed above  the overall effects of inflation and seasonality on the company s business were not significant
