net toy sales to amusement customers accounted for approximately of the company s net sales for fiscal the company sells both licensed and non licensed products to its amusement customers for use principally as redemption prizes 
sales to amusement customers generally result in higher gross margins than sales to retail customers  with gross margins from the sale of licensed products to amusement customers generally exceeding those of non licensed products 
although the company has continued to increase sales to amusement customers  sales to these customers as a percentage of net sales declined during fiscal due to the greater percentage increase in net sales to retail customers 
as a result of the acquisition of ace and due to ace s historic position in the amusement market  the company does not anticipate this trend to continue 
net toy sales to retail customers accounted for approximately of the company s net sales for fiscal to date  substantially all of the company s sales to retail customers have involved licensed products 
since the beginning of fiscal  the company has expanded its product offering of licensed stuffed toys through the addition of several licensed characters and trademarks 
in addition  the company commenced selling its play faces r product line to retail customers during the first quarter of fiscal during fiscal  the company experienced larger percentage increases in sales to retail customers than to amusement customers 
as a result of the acquisition  the company does not anticipate this trend to continue during fiscal due to the higher volume purchasing power enjoyed by many of the larger retail customers  sales to retail customers typically involve larger dollar amounts but lower gross margins than the company s sales to amusement customers 
however  the lower gross margins have been partially offset by lower marketing and distribution costs associated with the sales to the larger retail customers 
the company began its international expansion of its toy sales with the opening of its distribution facility in spain in august since that time  the company has experienced significant sales growth in its international operations  particularly in western europe 
international toy operations accounted for of net sales  and of consolidated income from operations for fiscal a significant portion of the company s international toy sales were generated by sales to the amusement market 
the company anticipates continued growth in international sales to both the amusement market and the retail markets 
in addition  the company anticipates an increase in sales of licensed products in international markets 
the company generally sells the same non licensed products in europe as in the united states 
the company sells certain licensed products exclusively in certain international countries while others are sold both domestically and internationally 
the company s european toy sales have generally resulted in higher gross margins than domestic toy sales 
the company s international and domestic operations are subject to risks such as manufacturing and transportation delays or interruptions  political and economic disruptions  weather  trade restrictions and fluctuations in foreign currencies 
while the company s operating results have not been materially impacted by such risks to date  there can be no assurance that such risks will not adversely impact the company s operations in the future 
the company s international toy sales are made primarily to european union countries through the company s spanish toy subsidiary 
to date  all direct shipment sales from third party manufacturers to the company s customers and the company s cost of such goods made by such subsidiary have been denominated in united states dollars 
accordingly  the company is exposed to foreign currency risk from the shipment date until receipt of payment 
substantially all other sales by such subsidiary are transacted in spanish pesetas  the functional currency  and have no currency risk 
purchases of raw materials by the company s spanish toy subsidiary for its stuffing operations from vendors in spain are transacted in spanish pesetas  therefore  there is no currency risk associated with those purchases 
however  when the company s spanish toy subsidiary purchases inventory from its suppliers in the far east  all such purchases are made in united states dollars and the company experiences currency risk to the extent that the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the spanish peseta fluctuates from the date the company s subsidiary is notified that merchandise is shipped until the date it pays for the goods in united states dollars 
pursuant to the terms of the company s license agreements with the walt disney company  time warner entertainment company  lp and mgm ua licensing and merchandising  a division of metro goldwyn mayer  inc for the sale of play faces r in canada  the company must pay royalties in canadian dollars 
the company s spanish toy subsidiary also has a license agreement with the coca cola company for the sale of stuffed toys in certain western european countries which requires the subsidiary to pay royalties in united states dollars 
as a result of these license agreements  the company experiences currency risk to the extent that exchange rates fluctuate from the date the royalty liability is incurred until the date the royalty is actually paid to the licensor 
additionally  the company is exposed to foreign currency risk for intercompany receivable and payable transactions through the settlement date 
historically  no attempt has been made to minimize  by means of hedging or derivatives  the risk of potential currency fluctuations  since the currency risk has not been significant 
the total unhedged exposure related to currency risk at july  was approximately  the company commenced operations in may and  as a result  has a limited operating history upon which investors may base their evaluation of the company s performance 
the company experienced significant growth in net sales and net income in fiscal  and as a result of the company s limited operating history and sales and income growth  period to period comparisons of operating results may not be meaningful and results of operations from prior periods may not be indicative of future results
