item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview since  the company believes its business has been affected by the end of the cold war  which permanently eroded the market demand for many of the company s traditional products 
the company believes that the united states intelligence community is adjusting its focus from the ex soviet union to a much wider and diverse population of threats 
because of this shift in focus from cold war driven planning  the company expects that large  long duration us government programs in defense intelligence and broadcasting will not return and that revenue from such contracts will generally constitute a smaller percentage of total revenue in future periods 
similarly  the company believes the long term market for ultra reliable hf communication systems will continue to diminish and will in the future be limited to predominantly overseas markets 
as a result  the company is in many cases forced to pursue smaller  overseas projects with a strong component of proprietary company products and software 
the company also intends to leverage its expertise in rf technology applications and its ability to conduct business in foreign markets by pursuing outside technology and business acquisitions which complement various characteristics of its existing core businesses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in implementing this diversification strategy 
recently  the company s diversification efforts have focused on three significant areas 
the first two areas relate directly to proprietary elements of frequency management technology for use in commercial aviation and maritime communications applications 
the third area of diversification leverages the direction finding technology developed by tci principally for military applications into a world wide market for similar radio spectrum monitoring and surveillance equipment 
these systems are used by national regulatory agencies  similar to the federal communications commission fcc to maintain order and discipline in the radio spectrum 
recently  the company determined that certain attributes of the maritime communications market  including an assessment that an ever growing  overabundance of satellite communications capacity is coming on line and as a result  introduction of a world wide  maritime communications network using proprietary elements of the company s hf radio technology is not economically viable at the present time 
it has consequently decided to halt the expenditure of development funds in this area 
while limited efforts continue to be made to find proprietary avenues for the use of the company s equipment in the commercial aviation market  any resultant suitable market for the company s products in this particular application is not expected to be large enough to materially affect future operating results 
during fiscal  teamed with the hewlett packard company  the company achieved its first diversification success as it won a contract to supply radio spectrum monitoring and surveillance equipment to a foreign customer due to be delivered in early in early fiscal  again teamed with the hewlett packard company  the company won its second significant radio spectrum monitoring and surveillance contract 
in an effort to increase both its market share and the gross margins available  the company plans to continue to make investments in its related product line so as to increase its relative content and value added component 
during the last three years the company has expended approximately  on research and development efforts related to its product and market diversification efforts 
all costs for such product development are presently funded internally and are expensed as incurred 
while the company has remained profitable during the period of this investment  the company expects that the future costs of these and other efforts including potential acquisitions may be significant enough to generate a loss from operations in both fiscal and while marketable products are not expected to be ready before fiscal  at the earliest  the investment of money and personnel will continue on each of the commercial efforts until either successful product introduction is achieved or it is determined that a viable market does not exist for these products 
the company s funded backlog as of september  was approximately million  compared to approximately million as of september  the following table sets forth the total backlog  which includes the value of unexercised options on us government contracts which the company believed were likely to be exercised  for the periods indicated in thousands as of september  backlog    of the million backlog at fiscal year end  approximately million is expected to be recognized as revenue prior to september  most contracts are  by their nature  subject to termination for reasons of cause or default  and on occasion  can be terminated for reasons beyond the control of the company 
the three year trend of relative stability in the total backlog is a reflection of the company s success in replacing diminishing sales from its traditional businesses with opportunities in the radio monitoring and spectrum compliance business area 
of the  total backlog reported at fiscal year end  approximately  is associated with the company s first diversification success in the form of two contract awards for the supply of spectrum monitoring and compliance systems for two foreign customers 
future growth in revenue and backlog is largely contingent on the ability of the company to successfully execute its plans for product and market diversification 
results of operations as an aid to understanding the company s consolidated operating results  the following table indicates the percentage relationships of income and expense items for each of the last three fiscal years 
percentage of revenue years ended september  revenue operating costs and expenses cost of revenue marketing  general and administrative income loss from operations investment income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income before change in accounting for income taxes change in accounting for income taxes sfas net income the approximate revenue attributable to contracts from both domestic and overseas customers is shown below in thousands domestic revenue    overseas revenue    total    in fiscal  largely due to the company s diversification success in the radio monitoring and spectrum compliance market  revenue continued its two year trend of growth from levels of the previous year 
because more than of fiscal revenue came from radio and spectrum compliance programs  substantially all of the company s revenue growth can be seen to have come from its diversification efforts which have been focused entirely overseas 
more specifically  revenue from one commercial contract in the radio monitoring and spectrum compliance business area represented of the total revenue in fiscal the company anticipates that revenue may continue to grow modestly  particularly in the international sector  but that it will not return to the historical levels of years prior to fiscal without the company first achieving additional and broad based success with product and market diversification efforts 
because the company has experienced significant competitive bidding pressures to be the low priced supplier in its broadcast and spectrum management system product lines during the last two years  the reduction in gross margins initially seen in fiscal continued during fiscal because the company expects to execute a significant portion of this backlog during fiscal  margins expressed as a percentage of revenue are not expected to improve until such time as new products are introduced which gain acceptance from customers in the form of new contracts 
in fiscal  marketing  general and administrative m  g a costs increased over previous year levels 
this increase reflects an added emphasis placed on marketing related activities as well as a general increase in personnel costs 
the company anticipates quarter to quarter fluctuations in the amount of revenue recognized based upon the timing of receipt of material on its long term contracts as well as the timing of award of foreign business  and as a result  quarter to quarter comparisons of revenue and profitability are not particularly meaningful 
the growth in revenue over that recognized in fiscal is attributable principally to increased activity in its existing core product businesses 
while fiscal overseas revenue remained at approximately the same level as fiscal  domestic revenue increased over prior year levels due to an increase in activity within the company s broadcast antenna systems business area 
due to forces similar to those experienced in fiscal  fiscal m  g a costs grew approximately over fiscal levels 
the one time effect of adopting sfas no 
in fiscal resulted in an increase in net income of  or 
per share during the same year 
excluding this one time adjustment  net income would have been of revenue 
over the recent three year period  the company has successfully minimized its payment of income taxes by offsetting these liabilities with a net operating loss carryforward nol originally generated in fiscal as a result  the effective tax rate incurred by the company in fiscal   and was   and respectively 
at the end of fiscal  the company had approximately  of nol remaining which to the extent it is able to generate profits the company intends to use the remaining nol to offset tax liabilities in future fiscal years 
if the company is unable to generate profits against which the nol would be utilized to offset a corresponding tax liability  the current nol would expire in a valuation allowance has been recorded for the entire deferred tax asset as a result of uncertainties regarding the realization of the asset due to the lack of consistent earnings history for the company 
expenditures for independent research and development ir d were approximately   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
in addition to ir d  a significant portion of engineering effort is customer sponsored by both cost reimbursement and fixed price contracts 
such engineering effort relates to the design and development of new products as well as improvements to existing products 
expenditures for customer sponsored research  development  and engineering were approximately   and  in fiscal   and  respectively 
additionally  a portion of new product development work of a conceptual nature is charged to bid and proposal costs when the development has an immediate  potential customer 
ir d and bid and proposal costs are included in m  g a expenses in the statements of operations 
during the past three years  a substantial part of the company s net income has been derived from interest income from its various investments 
because the company plans to expend significant funds on its product and market diversification efforts  and because the precise timing of payments due on existing contracts and the receipt of down payments on new contracts is difficult to predict  the company believes investment income may decline and may not return to current levels until such time as the company begins generating positive cash flows from its diversification activities 
factors that may affect future operating results the company operates in a highly competitive environment that involves a number of risks  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
fluctuations in operating results the company s operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year for a number of reasons 
while there is no seasonality to the company s business  because of the company s relative small size  combined with the extended delivery cycles of its long term project oriented business  revenue and accompanying gross margins are inherently difficult to predict 
because the company plans its operating expenses  many of which are relatively fixed in the short term  based on the assumption of stable performance  a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause profitability from operations to suffer 
historically  the company has endured periods of volatility in its revenue results due to a number of factors  including shortfalls in new orders  delays in the availability of new products  delays in subcontractor provided materials and services  and delays associated with foreign construction activities 
gross margins are strongly influenced by a mix of considerations  including pressures to be the low price supplier in competitive bid solicitations  the mix of contract material and non recurring engineering services  and the mix of newly developed and existing product sold to various customers 
the company believes these historical challenges will continue to affect its future business 
during fiscal  the company formed a wholly owned subsidiary  tciw  to provide wireless communication services to the maritime and commercial aviation markets using proprietary equipment developed by the company and facilities and bandwidth provided by various coast station operators around the world 
since its formation  the company has determined that an opportunity to provide a world wide maritime communications network using elements of its proprietary products is not economically viable at the present time  and as a result  has ceased expenditures on this activity 
the company intends  however  to leverage its expertise in rf technology applications and its ability to conduct business in foreign markets by pursuing outside technology and business acquisitions which complement various characteristics of its existing core businesses 
the company expects that the future cost of this product diversification strategy may be significant enough to generate a loss from operations during any quarter between now and at least the end of fiscal managing a changing business the company is in the process of adopting a business management plan that includes substantial investments in its sales and marketing organizations  increased funding of existing internal research and development programs  and certain investments in corporate infrastructure that will be required to support the company s diversification objectives during the next three years 
accompanying this process are a number of risks  including a higher level of operating expenses  the difficulty of competing with companies of larger size for talented technical personnel  and the complexities of managing a changing business 
there also exists the risk the company may inaccurately estimate the viability of any one or all of its diversification efforts and as a result  may experience substantial revenue shortfalls of a size so significant as to generate losses from operations 
risk associated with expansion into additional markets and product development the company believes that its future success is substantially dependent on its ability to successfully acquire  develop and commercialize new products and penetrate new markets 
in addition to the company s ongoing efforts to diversify its product offerings within its core businesses such as the spectrum management system business  the company intends to pursue a diverse  but focused product and market development initiative during the next three years 
the company believes that its general knowledge of rf technology and its related applications combined with its proven ability to conduct business in overseas markets can be exploited to return the company to an aggressive growth posture 
while not strictly limited to these product areas  the company is currently pursuing various rural communication and telephony applications using its proprietary technology  certain transmitter product initiatives in the fm  tv and wireless cable tv markets which compliment the company s antenna expertise  and certain rf technologies with potential application in the markets of tracking various kinds of assets in indoor and outdoor settings 
there can be no assurance that the company can successfully develop these or any other additional products  that any such products will be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at reasonable cost  or that any such products will achieve market acceptance 
should the company expend funds to acquire outside entities or technology  there can be no assurance that sufficient returns will be realized to offset these investments 
the inability of the company to successfully develop or commercialize new products or failure of such products to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with conducting business overseas a substantial part of the company s revenue are derived from fixed priced contracts with foreign governmental entities 
with increasing frequency  the company finds a demand for its products in third world countries and developing nations which have an inherently more volatile and uncertain political and credit risk profile than the us government market with which the company is accustom to conducting its business 
while the company seeks to minimize the collection risks on these contracts by normally securing significant advanced payments with the balance secured by irrevocable letters of credit  the company cannot always be assured of receiving full payment for work that it has performed due to unforeseen credit and political risks 
should such a default on payments owed the company ever occur  a significant effect on earnings  cash flows and cash balances may result 
competition most all of the company s products are positioned in niche markets which include strong elements of imbedded proprietary technology 
in most of these markets  the company competes with companies of significantly larger size  many of whom have substantially greater technical  marketing  and financial resources compared to similar resources available within the company 
this type of competition has resulted in and is expected to continue to result in significant price competition 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had approximately million in cash  short term investments and long term investment 
at september   the company had standby letters of credit outstanding of approximately million 
these standby letters of credit are collateralized by the company s cash or short term investments 
see further discussion in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the fiscal year end accounts payable balance is approximately three times the balance at fiscal year end the growth in this balance is attributable almost entirely to obligations the company has accrued  but not yet paid to subcontractors on its spectrum monitoring business 
as the company completes its obligations on these contracts  the payables and cash or cash equivalents balances are expected to return to levels more consistent with those experienced prior to fiscal the company currently believes that its cash and expected cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations through fiscal a significant portion of the company s sales is associated with long term contracts and programs in which there are significant inherent risks 
these risks include the uncertainty of economic conditions  dependence on future appropriations and administrative allotments of funds  changes in governmental policies  difficulty of forecasting costs and work schedules  product obsolescence  and other factors characteristic of the industry 
contracts with agencies of the us government or with prime contractors working on us government contracts contain provisions permitting termination at any time for the convenience of the government 
no assurance can be given regarding future financial results as such results are dependent upon many factors  including economic and competitive conditions  incoming order levels  shipment volume  product margins and foreign exchange rates 
the large size of certain of the company s orders makes it possible that a single contract termination  cancellation  delay  or failure to perform could have a significant adverse effect on revenue  results of operations  and the cash position of the company 
a portion of the company s revenue are derived from governments in areas of political instability 
the company generally attempts to reduce the risks associated with such instability by requesting advance payment if appropriate  as well as letters of credit or central government guarantees 
most of the company s overseas contracts provide for payments in us dollars 
however  in certain instances the company  for competitive reasons  must accept payment in a foreign currency 
management does not consider inflation to be a significant factor in its operations
