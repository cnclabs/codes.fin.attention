item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity capital resources working capital increased by approximately million to million 
this increase related primarily to the reduction of short term financing with the proceeds of long term debt issued in february  the company issued million of year notes bearing interest of 
the proceeds of the note issuance were used initially to reduce short term debt  but are ultimately intended to retire long term issues as they mature in fiscal year the increase in cash and cash equivalents reflects crop prefinancing invested temporarily in brazil on march   the date of consolidation of the company s brazilian subsidiaries 
for fiscal year  earnings from such investment vehicles was less than of consolidated pretax earnings 
as of june   all brazilian investments had been used for crop purchases 
although tobacco inventories increased slightly compared to last year  as of july  the company estimates that its uncommitted flue cured and burley tobacco inventories were approximately  tons  down from  tons a year ago 
in the first quarter of fiscal year  the company made some minor structural changes in its us tobacco operations 
the million of proceeds from minority investment in a subsidiary in the statement of cash flows represents cash proceeds from the issuance of stock in a newly formed subsidiary 
the company treated the issuance of these shares as an equity transaction and no gain or loss was recognized 
the company s capital needs are predominantly short term in nature and relate to working capital required for financing each operating segment s purchases 
the working capital needs of the company are seasonal within each geographical region 
generally  the peak need of domestic tobacco operations occurs in the second quarter of the fiscal year 
foreign tobacco operations tend to have higher requirements in the remainder of the year 
the geographical dispersion and the timing of working capital needs permit the company to predict its general level of cash requirements during the year 
each geographic area follows the cycle of buying  processing  and shipping of the tobacco crop 
the timing of individual customer shipping requirements may change the level or the duration of crop financing 
the working capital needs of individual agri products operations fluctuate during the year  depending on the product  the country of origin  and the company s inventory position  however  the total working capital requirements of the agri products segment during the year remain relatively stable due to offsetting seasonal patterns 
working capital needs of the lumber and building products segment follow a pattern similar to that of the construction industry in which the third quarter of the fiscal year is typically sluggish 
the company finances its working capital needs with short term lines of credit  exchange contracts for export prefinance  customer advances  and trade payables 
the international tobacco trade generally is conducted in us dollars thereby limiting foreign exchange risk to that which is related to production costs and overhead in the country in which the tobacco is sourced 
because there are no forward foreign currency exchange markets in many of the company s major countries of tobacco origin  the company manages its risk by matching funding for inventory purchases with the currency of sale and by minimizing its net investment in these countries 
in addition  it is a generally accepted practice in the tobacco processing industry that customers pay a market rate of interest for inventory purchased to their order  thus changes in interest rates do not have a major impact on the company s income and are not considered a source of significant risk 
the agri products and lumber and building products businesses  which are based in the united states and in the netherlands  do business in a number of foreign countries 
these operations enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sales commitments in foreign currencies principally dutch guilders  us dollars  german marks  swedish kronas  and pounds sterling 
the term of currency hedges is generally from one to six months 
acquisitions and investments are reflected in net cash used for investing activities 
over the last three years  total investment needs of million were provided by cash flow from operating activities 
investments of million in fiscal year included the acquisition of the leaf processing business of rjr macdonald  inc in canada 
that acquisition included a long term contract for the processing and supply of leaf tobacco to rj reynolds tobacco international  inc the company also entered into a joint venture processing agreement in guatemala and acquired an interest in a leaf processing company in tanzania 
the company enhanced its spice business by consummating a joint venture in the benelux area during the year 
these investments were funded with operating cash flow 
the company s capital expenditures are generally limited to those that add value to the customer  replace obsolete equipment  increase efficiency  or position the company for future growth 
during fiscal year  universal completed the installation of a processing facility in china and upgraded a number of us plants 
during fiscal  the company plans to improve its canadian facility as well as upgrade one of its african facilities 
management believes that these operations represent significant opportunities for growth over the long term and the expenditures will be funded from operating cash flow 
at june   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
the company believes that its financial resources are adequate to support its capital needs 
the company and its subsidiaries currently have billion in uncommitted lines of credit of which billion was available at june   to support future seasonal working capital needs in the united states and several foreign countries 
in addition  the company has million in an unused committed facility under a revolving credit agreement 
this facility is also available to support the issuance of commercial paper 
the company s debt ratings are investment grade  and its ratio of long term debt to total capitalization including deferred taxes is approximately 
any excess cash flow from operations after dividends  capital expenditures  and long term debt payments will be available to reduce short term debt  or fund expansion 
results of operations fiscal year compared to consolidated revenues in fiscal year increased million or over last year 
tobacco revenues accounted for well over of the increase  or million  principally due to improved market conditions 
increased demand from manufacturers led to increases in prices and volumes sold 
the balance of the increase is attributed to lumber and building product operations for which revenues were up million 
the lumber and building products revenue increase was due to a stronger dutch guilder vis a vis the us dollar  and the inclusion of heuvelman  a softwood distributor acquired last year  for the entire year versus seven months reported in fiscal year total agri product revenues were comparable year to year as increases in tea revenues were offset by reductions in canned meat and other product offerings 
tobacco operating profits in fiscal year were million  an increase of million over the prior year 
the majority of the improvement was due to handling larger leaf volumes  and improved operating margins 
fiscal year s tobacco operating profits were reduced by a million restructuring charge and million of inventory write downs 
in fiscal year the company benefited from reduced operating expenses that resulted from its restructuring efforts over the two previous years 
in the united states results improved on higher volumes of tobacco bought and processed  and shipments of prior years crops 
overall foreign tobacco operating profits were up due to the aforementioned improved market conditions and lower costs 
profit improvements were realized in south central america  europe and africa  while results from the far east and turkey were down due to reduced volumes and higher costs related to exchange differences  respectively 
included in the increased tobacco operating profits are improved results from dark tobacco operations reflecting continued strong demand for cigar leaf  particularly in the us fiscal year lumber and building product operating profits were up  benefiting from growth in the wholesale and do it yourself area  and the inclusion of heuvelman for the full year 
this improvement was partially offset as regional sales outlets suffered from historically low softwood prices and severe winter weather that resulted in the virtual shut down of the construction industry for a number of weeks late in the fiscal year 
agri product operating profits increased to million in fiscal year principally due to improved results in all areas except nuts and dried fruits 
selling  general and administrative expenses were up million or less than compared to last year 
the majority of the increase is due to the inclusion of heuvelman 
the increase was mitigated by approximately million of provisions recorded in fiscal year related to customer obligations in eastern europe 
interest expense was down slightly in fiscal year due to lower average borrowing rates 
fiscal year s income tax rate was compared to last year 
fiscal year s tax rate did not include full statutory benefits on the restructuring charge or on inventory write downs and provisions related to eastern europe 
the company s consolidated income tax rate in both years was affected by a number of factors  including but not limited to the mix of domestic and foreign earnings  subsidiary local tax rates  the company s policy regarding repatriation of foreign earnings  and its ability to utilize foreign tax credits 
at the end of fiscal year  the company implemented a number of tax planning strategies to minimize the increase in its tax rate above the statutory rate  and began realizing benefits in fiscal year during fiscal year  the company s restructuring plan was implemented 
the fiscal year charge included million for the expected costs of severance and deferred payments related to approximately employees throughout the company 
the non severance portion of the charge was for the write down of assets in operations consolidated million  other nonoperating restructuring costs million and cash payments to terminate occupancy of leased facilities million 
as of june  total cash payments of approximately million had been made to cover severance costs of employees 
any remaining actions related to the plan will be implemented in fiscal year and are not significant to the company s operations 
fiscal year compared to in fiscal year  the company began reporting its african operations on a consolidated basis 
previously  these operations were reported either on the cost or equity method 
the change in reporting did not materially affect the results of operations  and all prior years have been restated to reflect this change 
the most significant factor that resulted in an increase in previously reported fiscal year results was the inclusion of earnings  rather than only dividends received  from those companies previously accounted for under the cost method 
consolidated revenues were up million or in fiscal year compared to gross revenues in all three operating segments were up over the prior year  with lumber and building products accounting for over of the consolidated increase 
the improvement in lumber was due to a combination of increased sales  the inclusion of full year results of acquisitions and results of acquisitions in fiscal year  and exchange rate differences 
the total increase in revenues related to these acquisitions was almost million 
domestic tobacco revenues were up million because of an increase in sales and purchasing volume of about 
this improvement was due to the improved quality of the domestic crops as the company purchased more tobacco for customers 
tobacco operating profits were down or million compared to fiscal year s results 
tobacco operating profits in fiscal year included million of restructuring charges compared to million in the lower results in fiscal year reflect the continued pressure on margins from an unbalanced supply and demand situation 
fiscal year included million of tobacco inventory write downs  almost million of which was related to indonesian tobacco and eastern europe 
write downs in were million 
domestic tobacco s operating profits improved on increased volumes 
lumber and building products operating income for fiscal year was up or million largely due to the acquisition of heuvelman and a strong performance by the wholesale companies during the year 
operating profits as a percentage of sales decreased from in fiscal year to in due to the adverse effects of a strike in the dutch building industry  higher labor costs  and low prices for tropical plywood and hardwoods  however  improved volumes and acquired operations more than offset those factors 
agri products operating income increased to million in fiscal year the majority of this increase was due to the discontinuation of coffee trading near the end of fiscal year  that operation had recorded losses during the year 
trading activity in rubber showed improved results on the strength of higher prices 
tea results improved despite a flat market from continuing worldwide oversupply 
in addition  improved earnings were reported in confectionery sunflower seeds 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or compared to of the increase  million was due to the acquisition of the heuvelman lumber operation in fiscal year  and approximately million of the increase related to the aforementioned provisions for customer obligations in eastern europe and other areas 
interest expense in fiscal year dropped almost million compared to last year due to a combination of less crop financing in local currencies and reduced levels of inventory financing during the year 
fiscal year s income tax rate increased to 
as reported under results of operations fiscal year compared to  the effective tax rate was up due to of lower tax benefits on certain charges recorded and various factors related to the taxation of foreign source earnings 
other information regarding trends and management s actions the write downs in fiscal years and were a direct result of the widely discussed worldwide oversupply of tobacco inventories 
expectations of increased demand for tobacco products by manufacturers for newly opened markets in asia  eastern europe and the former soviet union  led to increased leaf production 
as eastern europe and the former soviet union attempted to implement economic reforms  problems were encountered related to taxes  exchange controls  inflation and trade policies 
this unstable environment led to reduced demand as tobacco production was increasing 
the threat of a significant increase in us excise taxes on tobacco products further reduced manufacturers expectations and demand  and in addition  the ill fated us domestic content legislation  which sharply restricted imports into the us  de stabilized world markets for leaf tobacco 
in some non auction market regions where the company operates  uncommitted inventories were exposed to valuation adjustments 
the tobacco dealer industry and growing regions took steps to reduce the volume of tobacco produced and available for sale  and this led to improved markets 
the outlook for fiscal year appears favorable assuming normal crop conditions 
worldwide supply and demand during fiscal year moved closer to being in balance 
however  as market prices increased  production volumes have grown  which could lead to imbalance in the future if demand is not sustained 
the current brazilian crop has been selling well despite a difficult operating environment 
the african markets are experiencing good demand  and larger volumes are expected 
although wet weather  including a hurricane  in the united states has adversely affected the current crop  total production and marketings are expected to be higher than those of last year 
the improvement in worldwide market conditions and the increased operating efficiencies achieved should continue to benefit the company 
although a number of factors remain beyond management s control  such as effects of weather on various crops and economic and fiscal policies in brazil and other countries  the company s balance and strength in all of the major tobacco origins provide a firm base for growth 
during fiscal year the brazilian government reduced inflation rates to year lows through fiscal policies included in its plano real economic plan  which entails financial control of items such as interest rates and exchange rates 
in addition  the brazilian government exercises control over taxation  trade policies  foreign investment and banking 
although there have been benefits realized from enacting the plano real  the long term viability of the government s plan is dependent on various factors  including whether the current administration can continue to hold office  the level of foreign currency reserves  and the confidence of the brazilian business sector 
recently there have been no significant changes in the brazilian federal government s economic policies  and none have been announced that would lead the company to believe there would be a significant impact on earnings for the company s fiscal year ending june  efforts to restrict or limit tobacco consumption  particularly in the united states  continued in fiscal year and will continue in the foreseeable future including civil product liability suits or actions taken by states in an attempt to hold the manufacturers responsible for medical costs 
these efforts include tax increases and regulations affecting access to cigarettes and public smoking 
the tobacco product manufacturers also face a number of lawsuits 
due to the nature  number  durations and varying degree of complexity of litigation and legislative initiatives  the outcomes or effect on consumption of tobacco products can not be predicted 
despite the unfavorable treatment of tobacco products in the media and the aforementioned restrictive actions in the united states  worldwide cigarette and cigar consumption continues to grow 
cigarette consumption has been growing at a annual rate worldwide  and a number of new or changing markets offer sourcing or sales opportunities for the company  especially in eastern europe  china  the republics of the former soviet union  and developing countries in the pacific rim 
china  where universal is active  offers potential as the largest consumer of tobacco products in the world and as a source of low priced filler style tobaccos for the export market 
the republics of the former soviet union offer potentially large leaf markets as internal production has declined and demand has been artificially constrained by economic dislocation and lack of foreign exchange 
in addition  management believes that worldwide consumption of american blend cigarettes has recently been increasing by percent a year 
the american blend cigarette has a milder flavor and higher percentage of flue cured and burley tobacco than competing products in many developing areas of the world  where darker  stronger tobacco has historically been the norm 
the company  through its presence in all of the major tobacco origins in the world  is positioned to take advantage of these opportunities 
a key trend in the tobacco industry has been consolidation among manufacturers and among merchants 
this concentration should increase the need for better quality tobacco and improved processing which provides a good opportunity for the company to demonstrate its strengths 
however  it may also make demand for particular growths of tobacco less predictable 
the company has a large presence in the us market where leaf has not been price competitive with the world market 
if not corrected through program reforms and reduced support prices  this could eventually result in a decline in us production and marketings 
management believes that the risk of a significant decline in the us crop in the next year is small 
the company s operations are well placed to supply leaf from many sources in world markets  and the business is not capital intensive 
in its lumber and building products area  the company has been leading a trend toward consolidation of a fragmented industry in holland and has proved itself an attractive business partner in that environment
