the private securities litigation reform act of the act was recently passed by congress 
the company desires to take advantage of the new safe harbor provisions in the act 
therefore  the company wishes to caution readers that the important factors discussed below in outlook issues and risks may  in some cases have affected  and in the future may affect  the company s actual results and may cause the company s actual results for and beyond  to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by  or on behalf of  the company 
overview worldcorp owns majority positions in companies that operate in two distinct business areas air transportation through world airways and transaction processing through us order 
mhs berhad of malaysia is an equity investor in world airways 
knight ridder and colonial data technologies  inc are equity investors in us order 
air transportation world airways earns revenue primarily from four distinct markets within the air transportation industry passenger and cargo services to major international air carriers  passenger and cargo services  on a scheduled and ad hoc basis  to the us government  passenger services in seasonal charter markets  and cargo services to small package shippers and freight forwarders 
in addition  in world airways commenced operations in a fifth market scheduled passenger cargo service which  beginning in  will include scheduled charters to leisure passenger markets on a seasonal basis 
with the exception of scheduled passenger cargo service  world airways generally charges customers on a block hour basis rather than a per seat or per pound basis 
a block hour is defined as the elapsed time computed from the moment the aircraft first moves under its own power at the point of origin to the time it comes to rest at its final destination 
world airways provides most services under two types of contracts basic contracts and full service contracts 
under basic contracts  world airways provides the aircraft  cockpit crew  maintenance and insurance and the customer provides all other operating services and bears all other operating expenses  including fuel and fuel servicing  marketing costs associated with obtaining passengers and or cargo  airport passenger and cargo handling fees  landing fees  cabin crews  catering  ground handling and aircraft push back and de icing services 
under full service contracts  world airways provides fuel  catering  ground handling  cabin crew and all related support services as well 
accordingly  world airways generally charges a lower rate per block hour for basic contracts than full service contracts  although it does not necessarily earn a lower profit 
because of shifts in the mix between full service contracts and basic contracts  fluctuations in revenues are not necessarily indicative of volume trends or profitability 
it is important  therefore  to measure world airways business volume by block hours flown and to measure profitability by operating income per block hour 
as is common in the air transportation industry  world airways has relatively high fixed aircraft costs 
while world airways believes that the lease rates on its md aircraft are favorable relative to lease rates of other md operators  its md aircraft have higher lease costs although lower operating costs than its dc aircraft 
therefore  achieving high average daily utilization of its aircraft particularly its md aircraft at attractive yields are two of the most critical factors to its financial results 
in addition to fixed aircraft costs  a portion of its labor costs are fixed due to monthly minimum guarantees to cockpit crewmembers and flight attendants 
customers world airways business relies heavily on its contracts with malaysian airline system berhad malaysian airlines  pt garuda indonesia garuda and the us air force s air mobility command amc 
these customers provided approximately   and  respectively  of world airways revenues and   and  respectively  of the total block hours during these customers provided approximately  and  respectively  of world airways revenues and   and  respectively  of total block hours in world airways has provided service to malaysian airlines since  providing wet lease services for malaysian airlines scheduled passenger and cargo operations as well as transporting passengers for the annual hadj pilgrimage 
in  world airways provided three aircraft for hadj operations and will provide three aircraft in the current five year hadj contract with malaysian airlines expires after the hadj 
world airways is currently in negotiations with malaysian airlines regarding future hadj operations 
as a means of improving aircraft utilization  world airways has recently sought multi year contracts with high utilization guarantees 
in late  world airways entered into a series of multi year contracts  with expiration dates running from through  to provide basic services to malaysian airlines 
one contract provides for world airways operation of three md freighter aircraft for a five year period for a combined guaranteed minimum of  hours per month except when an aircraft is in scheduled maintenance 
the lease for one of the aircraft commenced in june  and the leases for the other two aircraft commenced in june and july a second contract provides for each of two of its md passenger aircraft to operate a guaranteed minimum of hours per month from october through march for fiscal years and  and  respectively  of world airways revenues and and  respectively  of its block hours flown resulted from these new multi year contracts with malaysian airlines 
as a result of these contracts  world airways expects that the percentage of its total revenue generated from malaysian airlines in will continue to increase over historical levels 
world airways has provided international air transportation to the us air force since as compensation for pledges of aircraft to the civil reserve air fleet craf for use in times of national emergency  the us air force awards contracts to craf participants for peacetime transportation of personnel and cargo 
the us air force awards points to air carriers acting alone or through teaming arrangements in proportion to the number and type of aircraft that the carriers make available to craf 
as a result of its increasingly effective use of teaming arrangements  world airways fixed awards have grown in recent years and it has the largest us air force fixed award under the craf program for the us government s fiscal year 
the current annual contract commenced on october  and expires on september  these contracts provide for a fixed level of scheduled business from the us air force with opportunities for additional short term expansion business on an ad hoc basis as needs arise 
world airways fixed award for the current contract is million compared to the million fixed award for the prior contract 
due to the utilization of a significant number of its aircraft under multi year contracts with malaysian airlines and other contractual commitments  it is unlikely that world airways will be able to accept all of the available expansion business 
although overall defense department spending is being reduced  the level of us air force contract awards has remained relatively constant in recent years 
world airways  however  cannot determine how future cuts in military spending may affect future operations with the us air force 
world airways has provided wet lease services to garuda since operating under an annual hadj contract since 
world airways operated five aircraft in the garuda hadj and will operate seven aircraft in the hadj 
as a result of these and other contracts  world airways had an overall contract backlog at december  of million  compared to million at december  world airways backlog for each contract is determined by multiplying the minimum number of block hours guaranteed under the applicable contract by the specified hourly rate under such contract 
approximately of the backlog including substantially all of the backlog beginning in relates to the multi year contracts with malaysian airlines 
the loss of any of these contracts or a substantial reduction in business from any of these key customers  if not replaced  would have a material adverse effect on world airways financial condition and results of operations 
the information regarding major customers and foreign revenue is contained in note segment information of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements in item see outlook issues and risks below for specific issues and risks that may affect the financial performance of world airways 
transaction processing us order provides products and services for two markets home banking and smart telephones 
home banking allows consumers to pay bills  check account balances and receive other bank information from their homes 
us order currently receives its home banking revenues largely from the sale of products and services to visa international service association  inc visa member banks 
smart telephones are telephones with a central processing unit  an integrated display screen and memory which allow consumers to send and receive text information 
us order currently receives its smart telephone revenues from the sale of its products and bundled interactive applications to companies in the home banking and telecommunications industries 
to date  us order has generated limited revenues from the sale of its products and services 
us order has entered into agreements with visa interactive  inc visa interactive a wholly owned subsidiary of visa  in the home banking market and colonial data technologies corp 
colonial data in the smart telephone market 
in august  us order sold its electronic banking and bill pay operations to visa for approximately million  the assumption of certain liabilities and the right to receive certain royalties during a month period commencing january  in addition  visa designated us order as a preferred provider through the month royalty period and  as such  will make its member banks aware that us order can provide certain of its interactive applications  customer support services and smart telephones to visa member banks 
prior to december   us order s primary source of revenue was from the monthly service fees that it charged its customers for the use of its smart telephones and interactive applications 
as a result of the visa transaction  us order is in the process of converting these customers over to visa member banks  and expects to be offering its services strictly on a wholesale basis to visa and other strategic partners by the end of as each customer is converted to a visa member bank  us order will no longer collect monthly fee revenue directly from these customers 
in january  us order entered into a strategic alliance with a leading manufacturer of caller id units  colonial data  to jointly develop and distribute us order s next generation of smart telephones to the telecommunications industry 
us order s next generation smart telephone  the telesmart tm smart phone  is expected to be available for sale in the first half of on october   us order completed a transaction to acquire a equity interest in home financial network  inc homenet  a newly formed  development stage personal computer company that plans to develop and deliver electronic financial products and services for consumers 
at closing  us order exchanged  shares of its common stock  valued at approximately million  for of homenet 
us order believes that its investment in homenet will complement its home banking strategy by adding a personal computer based application to the current smart telephone and touch tone applications that it offers 
us order expects homenet to incur operating losses at least through of which us order will record its proportionate share 
to date  us order has generated limited revenue 
as a result of its new strategic relationships in the home banking and smart telephone markets  us order no longer offers its services directly to the end user but instead markets its products and services on a wholesale basis 
this shift in strategy has reduced its overall cost structure  in particular its expenditures for advertising and promotion  while improving its distribution channels 
due to the change in its strategy  us order expects that its sources of revenues in and the future  and the costs it incurs to generate such revenues  will differ from its results prior to as a result of the strategic change in its business focus  us order will generate revenue by selling its home banking products  and smart telephones  as well as by generating monthly fees for providing ongoing services  including interactive applications and customer support services 
revenue from product sales will be dependent on the success of us order s two largest strategic partners  visa interactive and colonial data  in marketing and selling the products in the banking and smart telephone channels 
in addition  us order has the right to receive on a quarterly basis from visa per month per active bill pay customer that uses the visa bill pay system through december  this payment from visa is subject to certain limitations  including a reduction in the royalty payment for each quarter beginning january  through december  by an offset amount the visa offset 
the visa offset  initially set at million per quarter  accumulates quarterly up to an aggregate of million 
us order has not received any revenue from these visa royalty payments through and does not expect to receive any revenue from these payments  after application of the visa offset  through at least the first half of see outlook issues and risks below for specific issues and risks that may affect the financial performance of us order

additionally  us order may utilize funds it expects to generate from asset sales  including approximately million of earlier generation smart telephones which it sells to third parties for use as point of sale terminals and from its approximately million advertising credit  which was received as partial consideration for certain shares of series c convertible preferred stock in  subject to certain restrictions regarding its usage 
holding company worldcorp is highly leveraged  and therefore requires substantial funds to cover debt service 
as a holding company  all of worldcorp s funds are generated through its subsidiaries  neither of which has paid dividends since additionally  worldcorp  which owns a majority position in world airways and us order s common stock  is subject to the provisions of two indentures expiring in and  respectively  under which it is obligated to cause the companies not to pay dividends under certain circumstances 
of the million in cash and cash equivalents at december   approximately million is held by world airways and us order and  therefore  is not available to satisfy worldcorp s obligations 
as of december   worldcorp had parent company repayment obligations  including principal and interest  of approximately million and million for and  respectively 
the company believes that the combination of the financings consummated to date and the operating and additional financing plans previously discussed will be sufficient to allow the company to meet its operating and capital requirements for the next twelve months 
financing developments in june  us order completed an initial public offering pursuant to which us order and worldcorp received million and million in net proceeds  respectively 
us order used part of its proceeds to satisfy debt obligations including those to worldcorp 
the remaining balance was added to us order s cash reserves 
world corp used its proceeds to fund its debt service requirements and increase its cash position 
in october  world airways completed an initial public offering pursuant to which world airways and worldcorp received approximately million and million in net proceeds  respectively 
each company used its proceeds to increase cash reserves 
on october   worldcorp  world airways  and mhs entered into the mhs stock purchase agreement pursuant to which mhs  subject to satisfactory completion of its due diligence investigations  agreed to purchase of world airways common stock 
on february   the transaction was completed 
world airways received upon closing million to fund its working capital requirements 
the remaining proceeds from the sale million less a million deposit received in november were paid directly to worldcorp 
in  world airways entered into the credit agreement  which included a million spare parts loan and an million revolving line of credit collateralized by certain receivables  inventory  equipment  and general intangibles 
world airways is prohibited from granting a security interest in such collateral to anyone other than bny financial corporation 
approximately million of the proceeds from this borrowing were used to retire existing obligations 
this agreement contains certain covenants related to world airways financial condition and operating results 
in march  august and september of  world airways amended this agreement to adjust certain covenants beginning in the first quarter of  in august and in september  respectively  and extended the credit facility s term to under the terms of the amended credit agreement  world airways is not permitted to i incur indebtedness in excess of million excluding capital leases  ii declare  pay  or make any dividend or distribution in any six month period which aggregate in excess of the lesser of million or of net income for the previous six months  iii declare or pay dividends if after giving effect to such dividends its cash or cash equivalents would be less than million or iv make capital expenditures in of more than million or in any subsequent year of more than million 
world airways must also maintain a certain quarterly net worth and net income loss requirements  and at december   world airways was in compliance with the terms of the credit agreement as in effect as of such date 
no assurances can be given that world airways will continue to meet these revised covenants or  if necessary  obtain the required waivers 
in addition  world airways amended the aircraft spare parts facility under the credit agreement to provide for a variable rate spare parts loan of million 
as of december   million of the million portion of the credit facility collateralized by receivables was utilized  with million capacity currently available  and million of the million spare parts loan was outstanding 
as discussed above  on september  world airways entered into an agreement with a lessor to purchase a spare engine  previously under lease  for million 
world airways paid million upon closing and signed a note for the million balance 
the note bears interest at a rate of and is payable over a month period at  a month  with the balance of million due on january  in the first quarter of  world airways obtained approximately million in short term borrowings from equipment lessors for working capital purposes  at an average interest rate of approximately 
these borrowings were repaid as of december  outlook issues and risks air transportation customers 
world airways business relies heavily on its contracts with malaysian airlines  garuda and the us air force 
these customers provided approximately   and  respectively  of world airways revenues and   and  respectively  of the total block hours during these customers provided approximately  and  respectively  of world airways revenues and   and  respectively  of total block hours in the loss of any of these contracts or a substantial reduction in business from any of these key customers  if not replaced  would have a material adverse effect on world airways financial condition and results of operations 
competition 
the air transportation industry is highly competitive and susceptible to price discounting 
certain of the passenger and cargo air carriers against which world airways competes possess substantially greater financial resources and more extensive facilities and equipment than those which are now  or will in the foreseeable future become  available to world airways 
world airways ability to provide service in certain foreign markets in the future may depend in part on the willingness of the us department of transportation the dot to allocate limited traffic rights to world airways rather than to competing us airlines  including major scheduled passenger carriers capable of carrying greater passenger traffic  and the approval of the applicable foreign regulators 
there can be no assurance that world airways will be able to obtain the traffic rights it seeks in expanding its business 
the allocation of military air transportation contracts by the us air force is based upon the number and type of aircraft a carrier  alone or through a teaming arrangement  makes available for use in times of national emergencies 
the formation of competing teaming arrangements that have larger partners than those sponsored by world airways  an increase by other air carriers in their commitment of aircraft to the emergency program  or the withdrawal of world airways current partners  could adversely affect the size of the us air force contracts  if any  which are awarded to world airways in future years 
in the passenger airline market  world airways generally competes on the basis of price  quality of service  including on time reliability and in flight service  and schedule convenience 
many of its competitors in the passenger airline market both scheduled and non scheduled passenger air carriers compete for passengers in a variety of ways 
during periods of dramatic fare cuts by its competitors  world airways may be forced to respond with reduced pricing  which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
world airways also competes directly against charter airlines  some of which are substantially larger than it  and certain of which are affiliates of major scheduled airlines or tour operators 
as a result  in addition to greater access to financial resources  these charter airlines may have greater distribution capabilities  including exclusive or preferential relationships with affiliates that are tour operators 
world airways believes that the most important bases for competition in the air cargo business are the payload and cubic capacities of the aircraft  and the price  flexibility  quality and reliability of the cargo transportation service 
cyclical nature of air carrier business 
world airways operates in a challenging business environment 
the air transportation industry is highly sensitive to general economic conditions 
since a substantial portion of passenger airline travel both business and personal is discretionary  the industry tends to experience severe adverse financial results during general economic downturns 
the airline industry may also be adversely affected by unexpected global political developments 
this is important since world airways flies to and from countries such as northern ireland  israel  and south africa 
the financial results of air cargo carriers are also adversely affected by general economic downturns due to the reduced demand for air cargo transportation 
in and  the combination of a generally weak global economy and the depressed state of the air transportation industry has adversely affected world airways operating performance 
although world airways has experienced a growth in demand  such that world airways has increased block hours flown by in over and in over  there can be no assurance that this growth will continue 
seasonality 
historically  world airways business has been significantly affected by seasonal factors 
during the first quarter  world airways typically experiences lower levels of utilization and yields as demand for passenger and cargo services is lower relative to other times of the year 
world airways experiences higher levels of utilization in the second quarter  principally due to peak demand for commercial passenger services associated with the annual hadj pilgrimage 
during  world airways flight operations associated with the hadj pilgrimage occurred from april to june because the hadj occurs approximately to days earlier each year  revenues resulting from future hadj contracts will begin to shift from the second quarter to the first quarter over the next several years 
in recent years  soft demand and weakening yields in worldwide passenger markets adversely affected its results in the third quarter 
fourth quarter utilization depends primarily on the demand for air cargo services in connection with the shipment of merchandise in advance of the us holiday season 
world airways believes that its recent multi year contracts with malaysian airlines and an increase in peak european summer tourist travel occurring in the third quarter should lessen the effect of these seasonal factors 
the quarterly financial data is contained in note unaudited quarterly results of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements in item operating losses 
while world airways was profitable each year from through and in  it sustained operating losses in and of million and million  respectively  and net losses of million in each of these two years 
there can be no assurance that world airways will be able to sustain its current profitability 
see selected financial data and results of operations 
maintenance 
world airways outsources major airframe maintenance and power plant work to several suppliers 
world airways has a year contract ending in august with united technologies corporation s pratt whitney group pratt and whitney for all off wing maintenance on the pw engines that power its md aircraft 
under this contract  the manufacturer agreed to provide such maintenance services at a cost not to exceed a specified rate per hour during the term of the contract 
the specified rate per hour is subject to annual escalation  and increases substantially in accordingly  while world airways believes the terms of this agreement will result in lower engine maintenance costs than it otherwise would incur during the first five years of the agreement  these costs will increase substantially during the last seven years of the agreement 
world airways has contracted with caledonian airmotive limited for off wing maintenance on the cf c engines that power its dc aircraft 
world airways believes these contracts provide high quality power plant services at competitive costs 
world airways maintenance costs associated with the md aircraft and pw engines have been significantly reduced due in part to manufacturer guarantees and warranties  which guarantees and warranties began to expire in and will fully expire by therefore  world airways expects that maintenance expenses will increase as these guarantees and warranties expire 
world airways material services group acquires and manages the inventory of spare parts and consumable materials required to support line maintenance  scheduled airframe maintenance and power plant maintenance 
world airways has established an inventory management facility in wilmington  delaware  to support this activity 
as part of this activity  the material services group tracks the inventory status of the spare parts kits carried aboard each of its aircraft 
each of world airways aircraft carries spare parts and support kits  which consist of approximately to million in parts and special equipment 
in addition  a highly trained maintenance representative is on board all flights to destinations where it does not have on site maintenance facilities 
growth opportunities 
in the scheduled charter market  world airways has identified what it believes is a significant opportunity to increase revenues and profits by serving potentially profitable leisure passenger markets between the us and europe 
in the scheduled charter business  world airways sells less than planeload blocks of seats to international tour operators and markets the remaining seats through computer reservations systems 
based on the successful experience of european carriers  world airways believes serving the seasonal passenger markets on a scheduled charter basis will have several benefits which it believes outweigh the potential increased load and yield risk associated with serving this market 
first  it should be possible to achieve greater revenue per block hour because tour operators will pay higher prices in exchange for not bearing the risk of filling an entire aircraft 
second  world airways expects to increase the hourly utilization of its aircraft deployed in this market because it will set the schedules rather than a tour operator that  in the case of a full planeload charter  has contracted for the entire aircraft and controls scheduling 
this strategy gives world airways more control within the charter distribution channel and a stronger commercial position in this market than it would have in the full load charter business 
for the leisure market season  world airways has developed schedules and is marketing capacity to tour operators with particular emphasis on the markets between the us and germany  switzerland  ireland  and the united kingdom 
although world airways believes that scheduled charters may improve utilization and yields in the leisure passenger market for the reasons described above  it has no prior experience operating scheduled charters and can  therefore  provide no assurances that it will be able to operate scheduled charters profitably 
in the scheduled passenger business  world airways will consider entering only those markets that it believes i are well suited to the competitive advantages of its long range  wide body aircraft  ii have prospects for rapid growth  and iii have barriers to entry 
after determining that the market between new york and tel aviv met these criteria  world airways commenced scheduled passenger service in this market in july with three weekly round trips 
in march  world airways reduced its weekly frequencies from three to two until the summer peak tourist season 
in addition  world airways recently received regulatory authority to provide scheduled passenger and cargo service between the united states and points in west africa and south africa beginning in the second quarter of while world airways has achieved a cumulative load factor on the tel aviv route as of february  yields have been significantly lower than expected due to price sensitive  high commission traffic originating in the new york area and the lack of a marketing relationship with a major us carrier to feed its new york departures 
as a result of these factors  world airways has sustained operating losses on this route since commencing scheduled service to tel aviv in july in response to these issues  world airways has taken steps to improve its yield and load factor performance 
first  as discussed above  world airways has reduced its weekly frequencies to tel aviv from three to two until this summer s peak tourist season 
second  and more importantly  world airways has formed  subject to definitive documentation  a strategic alliance with continental airlines continental 
this agreement with continental includes codesharing  joint marketing  and participation in continental s computer reservation system and onepass frequent flyer program 
world airways international passengers will connect through continental s newark international airport newark hub to major us cities as well as canada and mexico 
continental s passengers will connect directly on world airways international destinations including israel  ireland  and south africa 
in conjunction with this alliance  world airways will begin flying from newark in june although world airways hopes that its strategic alliance with continental will improve financial results on its scheduled passenger routes  including but not limited to its tel aviv route  no assurances can be given that world airways will be able to operate its scheduled passenger routes profitably even with the continental alliance 
ability to manage growth 
as described above  world airways is currently experiencing rapid growth in its existing operations and intends to enter new markets 
for example  world airways fleet size increased from to  and total block hours increased over the comparable period 
in the first quarter of  world airways fleet size was further enhanced with the delivery of two md er aircraft and two additional dc aircraft 
if world airways management is unable to manage this growth  its financial performance and results of operations may be adversely affected 
additionally  world airways entrance into new markets requires more skilled personnel and distribution capability 
an inability to hire skilled personnel or to develop its distribution capability may also adversely affect world airways ability to operate profitably in its new markets 
control by worldcorp  potential conflicts of interest 
as of december   worldcorp owned approximately of world airways 
worldcorp is highly leveraged and therefore requires substantial funds to cover debt service each year 
as a result of worldcorp s cash requirements  it may be required to sell additional shares of world airways common stock from time to time  and such sales  or the threat of such sales  could have a material adverse affect on the market price on world airways common stock 
except as limited by contractual arrangements with mhs  worldcorp also is in a position to control the outcome of substantially all issues submitted to world airways stockholders  including the election of all of world airways board of directors  adoption of amendments to world airways certificate of incorporation  and approval of mergers 
under delaware law  worldcorp may approve certain actions by written consent without a meeting of the stockholders of world airways 
in addition  world airways board of directors has eight members  one of whom  t 
coleman andrews  iii  is president  chief executive officer  and a director of worldcorp 
the managements of worldcorp and world airways are currently exploring ways to maximize value for the shareholders of each company  including actively exploring the feasibility of world airways employee initiatives to purchase a substantial portion of worldcorp s ownership position in world airways 
in addition to employee initiatives  worldcorp is evaluating the feasibility of a spinoff of its interest in world airways or a disposition to a third party 
there can be no assurances  however  that any such transactions will ultimately be consummated 
transaction processing minimal revenues  history of losses 
us order did not introduce its first commercial product until and accordingly has a limited operating history 
to date  us order has generated limited revenues from the sale of its products and services  has incurred significant losses and has experienced a substantial negative cash flow 
us order expects to incur operating losses during there can be no assurance that us order will be able to achieve profitability and  if achieved  sustain such profitability  nor can there be any assurance as to when such profitability might be achieved 
us order is subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise 
developing marketplace 
home banking and smart telephones are developing markets 
consumer preferences in interactive technologies are difficult to predict 
us order s future growth and profitability will depend  in part  upon consumer acceptance of electronic home banking and smart telephone technologies and a significant expansion in the consumer market for telephone based interactive applications technologies 
even if these markets experience substantial growth  there can be no assurance that us order s products and services will be commercially successful or benefit from such growth 
early stage products and services 
the continued development of the marketplace for us order s products and services will depend in part upon its ability to create and develop additional applications for its technologies 
many of us order s products and services  including its smart telephones  are in the early stages of development or marketing  and are subject to the risks inherent in the development and marketing of new products and services 
control by worldcorp  potential conflicts of interest 
as of december   worldcorp investments  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of worldcorp owned approximately of us order s outstanding common stock 
worldcorp is highly leveraged  and therefore requires substantial funds to meet debt service requirements each year 
as a result of worldcorp s cash requirements  it may be required to sell shares of us order from time to time and such sales  or the threat of such sales  could have a material adverse effect on the market price for us order s common stock 
as of december  worldcorp was also in a position to control the outcome of substantially all issues submitted to us order s stockholders 
under delaware law  worldcorp is also able to approve certain actions by written consent without a meeting of the stockholders of us order 
in addition  us order s board of directors has eight members  five of whom also serve on the board of directors of worldcorp 
dependence on strategic alliances 
us order s business strategy is to sell products and services that support and enhance home banking and smart telephones primarily through a strategic alliance in each of these two markets 
us order s primary success in each area depends both on the ultimate success of these partners as well as on the ability of its partners to successfully market its products  services and interactive applications 
also  there can be no assurance that these alliance partners  visa interactive and colonial data  view their alliance with us order as significant for their own businesses or that they will not reassess their commitment to us order at any time in the future 
fluctuations in operating results 
us order may experience fluctuations in quarterly operating results due to the size and timing of customer orders or the royalty payments from visa interactive  changes in us order s pricing policies or those of its competitors  new product introductions or enhancements by competitors  delays in the introduction of new products or product enhancements by us order or by its competitors  customer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new products  market acceptance of new products  the timing and nature of sales and marketing expenses  research and development expenses  other changes in operating expenses  personnel changes and general economic conditions 
fluctuations in operating results could result in volatility in the price of us order s common stock 
restrictions from the visa agreement 
as a condition of visa s acquisition of us order s bill payment and banking operation  us order has agreed to work exclusively with visa in certain areas and to refrain from certain activities that are in competition with visa and its affiliates 
these covenants may increase us order s reliance upon visa 
us order s dependence on visa  and the terms of the agreement between the parties  may have a material adverse effect on us order 
volatility of stock price 
since its recent initial public offering  the market price of us order s common stock has experienced significant volatility 
the stock market has experienced volatility that has particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many high technology and developmental stage companies and that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
factors such as announcements of the introduction of new products or services by us order or its competitors  announcements of joint development efforts or corporate partnerships in the interactive applications industry  market conditions in the banking  telecommunications and other emerging growth company sectors and rumors relating to us order or its competitors may have a significant impact on the market price of its common stock 
technological considerations 
us order s business activities are concentrated in fields characterized by rapid and significant technological advances 
there can be no assurance that us order will remain competitive technologically or that its products  processes or services will continue to be reflective of such advances 
dependence on key employees 
us order is highly dependent on certain key executive officers and technical employees  the loss of any of whom could have an adverse impact on the future operations of us order 
dependence on foreign production 
us order s smart telephones are manufactured by manufacturers with facilities in hong kong  taiwan and the people s republic of china 
the availability or cost of these smart telephones may be adversely affected by political  economic or labor conditions in hong kong  including the return of hong kong to china  and by fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
in addition  a change in the tariff structure or other trade policies of the united states or countries from which it imports products could adversely affect us order s foreign manufacturing strategies 
other matters legal and administrative proceedings the company and world airways the world defendants are defendants in litigation brought by the committee of unsecured creditors of washington bancorporation the committee in august  captioned washington bancorporation v 
boster  et

proc 
bankr 
ddc the boster litigation 
the complaint asserts that the world defendants received preferential transfers or fraudulent conveyances from washington bancorporation when the world defendants received payment at maturity on may  of washington bancorporation commercial paper purchased on may  washington bancorporation filed for relief under the federal bankruptcy code on august  the committee seeks recovery of approximately million from world airways and approximately million from worldcorp  which are alleged to be the amounts paid to each of world airways and worldcorp by washington bancorporation 
on the motion of the world defendants  among others  the boster litigation was removed from the bankruptcy court to the district court for the district of columbia on may  the world defendants filed a motion to dismiss the boster litigation as it pertains to them on june   and intend to vigorously contest liability 
on september   the district court for the district of columbia granted the motion to dismiss filed by the world defendants with respect to three of the four counts alleged in the litigation  but declined to grant a motion to dismiss the remaining claim regarding fraudulent transfers 
the district court s ruling is subject to appeal in certain cases 
the world defendants filed a summary motion with respect to the remaining claim on october   which remains pending 
in any event  the company believes it has substantial defenses to this action  although no assurance can be given of the eventual outcome of this litigation 
depending upon the timing of the resolution of this claim  if the committee were successful in recovering the full amount claimed  the resolution could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the company is party to routine litigation and administrative proceedings incidental to its business  none of which is believed by the company to be likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
employees world airways cockpit crew members  who are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters the teamsters  are subject to a four year collective bargaining agreement that will become amendable in june world airways flight attendants are also represented by the teamsters under a collective bargaining agreement that became amendable in the parties exchanged their opening contract proposals in and have had numerous contract negotiation sessions 
in december  world airways and the teamsters jointly requested the assistance of a federal mediator to facilitate negotiations 
after several mediated sessions  the national mediation board the nmb mediator recommended that the nmb release the parties to pursue direct ie  non mediated negotiations with the flight attendants 
world airways and the teamsters agreed and direct negotiations continue 
the outcome of the negotiations with the flight attendants cannot be determined at this time 
the inability to reach an agreement upon terms favorable to world airways could have a material adverse effect on world airways 
world airways flight attendants continue to challenge the use of foreign flight attendant crews on its flights for malaysian airlines and garuda indonesia which has historically been world airways operating procedure 
world airways is contractually obligated to permit its southeast asian customers to deploy their own flight attendants 
while it intends to contest this matter vigorously in an upcoming arbitration  an unfavorable ruling for world airways could have a material adverse effect on world airways 
world airways aircraft dispatchers are represented by the transport workers union the twu 
this contract became amendable on june  in may  the parties reached agreement with respect to a new four year contract 
this contract was ratified on february  fewer than company employees are covered by this collective bargaining agreement 
world airways is unable to predict whether any of its employees not currently represented by a labor union  such as its maintenance personnel  will elect to be represented by a labor union or collective bargaining unit 
the election by such employees of representation in such an organization could result in employee compensation and working condition demands that could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the company 
dividend policy worldcorp has never paid any cash dividends and does not plan to do so in the foreseeable future 
both the subordinated notes indenture and the indenture pursuant to which the debentures were issued the indentures restrict the company s ability to pay dividends or make other distributions on its common stock 
the million credit facility also contains restrictions on world airways ability to pay dividends 
under this agreement  world airways cannot declare  pay  or make any dividend or distribution in any six month period which aggregate in excess of the lesser of million or of net income for the previous six months 
in addition  world airways must have a cash balance of at least million immediately after giving effect to such dividend or distribution 
additionally  worldcorp  which owns a majority position in world airways and us order s common stock  is subject to the provisions of two indentures expiring in and  respectively  under which it is obligated to cause the companies not to pay dividends under certain circumstances 
under the indenture terminating in  worldcorp has agreed to cause the companies not to pay dividends if at the time worldcorp is in default under such indenture 
further  under the indenture terminating in  worldcorp has agreed to cause the companies not to pay dividends unless worldcorp has a positive adjusted net worth as defined therein 
as of march   worldcorp s adjusted net worth was negative and under the indenture terminating in worldcorp is therefore obligated to cause the companies not to pay dividends 
all of the funds from operations are generated by the company s subsidiaries 
the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to pay principal and interest on their respective short and long term obligations is substantially dependent upon funds generated by the operations of the subsidiaries  the payment to the company of dividends  and its ability to sell additional shares of its subsidiaries stock 
income taxes at december  worldcorp had approximately million in net operating loss carryforwards nols that are available to offset future federal taxable income 
there can be no assurance that the company will generate taxable income in future years so as to allow the company to realize a tax benefit from its nols 
the nols are subject to examination by the irs and  thus  are subject to adjustment or disallowance resulting from any such irs examination 
in addition  ownership changes of the company  pursuant to the internal revenue code  may occur in the future and may result in the imposition of an annual limitation on the company s nols existing at the time of any such ownership change 
in addition  world airways  which does not file a consolidated income tax return with the company  had a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets as of december  of million 
world airways estimate of the required valuation allowance is based on a number of factors  including historical operating results 
world airways generated net earnings for the year ended as compared to losses in both and if world airways continues to generate net earnings in  it is possible that a change in the estimate of the required valuation allowance will occur in the near term  and could differ materially from the amount recorded at december  a portion of world airways nols are subject to an annual limitation as a result of a previous ownership change  for tax purposes  which occured in new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no
