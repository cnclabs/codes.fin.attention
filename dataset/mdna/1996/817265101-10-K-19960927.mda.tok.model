working capital items the company has historically had a high level of receivables and sales type leases outstanding  measured as a percentage of revenues 
this results in part from a key element of the company s marketing strategy of using its size and financial strength to increase market penetration by providing alternative financing options to its retail customers ie  vendor financing 
this strategy has given the company a significant competitive advantage and has helped the company penetrate markets and increase customer loyalty and commitment to sensormatic 
the ability to pursue such a strategy results from the company s relatively high gross profit margins and its ability to sell receivables and leases to financing institutions 
product research  development and engineering the company has increased its research  development and engineering expenditures during the past decade 
the increase in these activities has resulted in the continued broadening of the systems and technology offered by the company  resulting in the expansion of the applications and customer base for the company s systems

the company has yet to receive any direct notice from the fda with regard to that study 
the company is also aware of studies in europe as to whether any hazards are posed to wearers of implantable heart devices by a number of devices  including eas systems 
while the company believes there to be substantial evidence that no such hazards are posed by the company s eas systems  and offers such evidence to persons conducting such studies  there can be no assurance that one or more of such studies will not result in the publication of reports  the recommendation of precautionary measures and or the adoption of regulations which could adversely affect the company

results of operations overview consolidated revenues increased to million in fiscal versus million in fiscal  as compared to an increase of in fiscal versus fiscal in fiscal  revenues in all regions and business units increased over the previous year 
the continued increase in revenues is attributable to a strategy of product  customer and geographic market diversification 
the fiscal revenue growth also reflects  in part  the impact of the acquisition of knogo s non us operations in december more than of fiscal revenues were generated from outside the us results of operations reflected a loss of million in fiscal versus income from operations of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the company reported a net loss of million  or a per share loss of  in fiscal  versus net income in fiscal of million  or earnings per share of  and net income in fiscal of million  or earnings per share of

see restructuring and special charges below and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the following table presents earnings for fiscal  both as reported and excluding restructuring and special charges  as compared to fiscal and fiscal in millions  except per share amounts excluding restructuring as and special as as reported charges reported reported operating loss income net loss income loss earnings per share 
restructuring and special charges and other strategies over the past decade  the company has grown from a single technology  single market company with gross revenues of less than million in fiscal to a global provider of multiple electronic security solutions with gross revenues of approximately billion in fiscal a significant percentage of this growth was achieved over the past four years  as revenues reported for fiscal were approximately million and have since grown by a compound average growth rate of 
this growth was attained principally through internally developed new products  various strategic acquisitions and increased market penetration in existing and new markets 
the rapid growth experienced by the company in sales  customers and product diversity and the demands of integrating acquired businesses outpaced the development of the company s corporate infrastructure and systems 
in addition  expenses and working capital requirements increased to unacceptable levels 
consequently  in fiscal  the company launched a strategic restructuring plan with the following objectives i expense reduction and asset control  ii improved processes and systems  and iii quality growth 
the initial phase of this plan included an extensive and systematic review of the company s operations  cost structure and balance sheet aimed at reducing its operating expenses and manufacturing costs while increasing efficiencies 
this review of the company s global operations focused primarily on operational systems  organizational structures  facilities utilization  product rationalization  inventory levels and accounts receivable balances 
in fiscal  as a result of the above initiatives  the company recorded restructuring and special charges totaling million with an after tax impact of million 
restructuring charges the company instituted a major reorganization of its business units as a result of this review 
the principal objective of the reorganization is to improve market focus  customer service and product quality while reducing costs and eliminating redundancies 
under the new structure  the company reorganized its six business units into four 
the company also created product line management functions both within its c i worldwide business unit and in support of its three retail business units 
additionally  the company formed the global source tagging division  with responsibility to manage and direct the company s source tagging initiatives worldwide 
the company planned for the reduction of people  most of which has occurred  and the sale  disposal or termination of lease arrangements of locations  principally in the uk and uk the company also reviewed its existing product lines and product sourcing to discontinue marginally profitable products and outsource other products 
as a result  the company recorded a restructuring charge related to discontinued products and equipment used in the manufacture of certain products which will no longer be manufactured by the company or purchased from third party suppliers 
these actions are expected to result in lower inventory carrying costs and improved gross margins on continued products 
the following table sets forth the details and activity of the restructuring charges recorded in fiscal in millions accrual reductions balance at june  provision cash non cash product rationalization  related equipment charges and other closure of facilities and related costs employee termination and related costs total it is anticipated that approximately million of these costs will result in cash outlays  of which million was disbursed as of june  upon completion of the planned restructuring activities  the company expects to realize related annual savings in operating expenses and manufacturing costs of approximately million 
these savings will be partially offset by costs associated with the addition of approximately employees in strategic growth and key technical areas 
in addition  the company has initiated programs to reduce other variable operating expenses  exclusive of payroll and related costs  by approximately million annually 
the restructuring plan is expected to be substantially completed prior to the end of and  the company believes the provisions recorded are adequate to cover the costs associated with this plan 
special charges as part of the company s plan to focus on asset management and review its balance sheet in view of the current business environment  the company performed an extensive review of the collectibility of accounts receivables  including off balance sheet receivables 
this initiative was primarily the result of the overall weakening in the retail industry following a poor holiday season 
in addition  several commercial industrial and retail customers filed for bankruptcy and other customers experienced financial difficulties 
the company also conducted a review of slow moving and potentially obsolete inventory in light of softening demand for certain eas products 
as a result of these reviews  the company recorded a charge to operations of million in fiscal which primarily represented increases in the valuation allowances for doubtful accounts receivable and inventories 
of this amount  million related to receivables and other matters and million related to inventories and revenue equipment 
special charges are included in the consolidated statement of operations as follows million in costs of sales  million in depreciation on revenue equipment  million in selling  customer service and administrative expenses and million in research  development and engineering expenses 
other strategies to assist with the company s restructuring plan objective to improve processes and systems  the company has embarked upon a total quality management program internally referred to as the q program 
the program s objective is to provide superior value for customers  shareholders and employees 
the q program is a multi year effort in which the company will reengineer the way it operates enterprise wide 
the program will also establish a culture of continuous improvement in all of the company s business processes to reduce cost and increase customer satisfaction 
in connection with this program  the company has committed to the implementation of a new enterprise wide management information system which is expected to significantly enhance operational efficiencies and improve customer service 
key revenue growth strategies of the company include the following recurring revenues 
the sales of disposable labels to hard goods retailers  maintenance agreements entered into in connection with the sale or lease of systems  and rental revenues from operating leases are an expanding source of recurring revenues 
in fiscal  recurring revenues were approximately million compared to approximately million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the company has focused major efforts on increasing future recurring label revenues through source tagging  the process in which eas labels are incorporated into manufactured articles or packaging by the manufacturer or distributor at the point of manufacture or distribution 
the ultimate goal of source tagging is the concealed integration of eas labels within a product or its primary packaging  thus keeping eas labels out of sight and reach of the consumer 
this is sometimes referred to as integrated source tagging or source integration 
the company has a leadership position in source tagging and source integration  with over manufacturers source tagging more than  stock keeping units sku s with sensormatic labels 
the company recently introduced the ultra strip narrow label which delivers superior performance at a cost significantly lower than the standard ultra strip label cost  and is well suited  based on key performance criteria  for integrated source tagging 
the company believes integrated source tagging will be increasingly necessary to make source tagging an effective and widely accepted practice by manufacturers and retailers 
c i worldwide operations 
the company has reorganized its commercial industrial operations into a single global business unit  c i worldwide  to allow the company to centralize and focus its commercial industrial marketing and product development strategies 
c i worldwide has carried out further reorganization and centralization of its product line management and development functions to bring greater focus on meeting customer requirements worldwide 
additionally  each of c i worldwide s regional sales organizations has been organized into an enterprise accounts division  which focuses on integrated security solutions targeted to major national and global customers through a direct sales force and a security products division  which focuses on customer and sales channel requirements through a dealer distributor network 
the company expects that the global reorganization of c i worldwide will help to focus the company s strategy to be an integrated electronic security provider with enhanced products and a broader customer base 
products 
the company has been focusing its research and development efforts on a number of key strategic products including ultradome cctv  ultrapost eas and rfid smart tag 
rfid smart tags utilize a radio frequency identification and acousto magnetic technologies and can be used by retailers to manage their merchandise and can also be used to protect and track assets and people 
the company is combining its resources with other partners  such as texas instruments  motorola  paxar and micron communications  inc  micron as part of its product development efforts 
the company s newest alliance is with micron  who is known for their remote intelligent communications technology 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the following discussion of operating results excludes the effects of the restructuring and special charges recorded in fiscal  which were discussed above 
revenues as noted above  revenues for fiscal increased  or million  over fiscal as all regions and business units increased revenue as compared to the prior year 
the revenue growth resulted principally from increased sales of cctv products  which are used by both retail and commercial industrial customers  and eas products and systems 
cctv revenues increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal eas revenues increased principally from the magnetic and ultra max product line 
ultra max revenues increased primarily as a result of increased revenues from hard goods retail customers and from ultra max and ultra strip labels used in source tagging 
worldwide access control system revenues increased to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal cctv and access control system revenues from the us region of c i worldwide increased to million due primarily to increased sales of cctv products to non retail customers and an increase in market penetration 
fiscal was a transition year for c i worldwide as the company rationalized product lines  manufacturing and overhead facilities and dealer distributor organizations 
consolidated revenues for the eas product lines increased from the comparable period last year  principally due to growth in all geographic areas from ultra max product line revenues  which increased from the prior year as noted previously 
revenues from the magnetic product lines increased  with the greatest increase in europe  due in part to the acquisition of knogo effective in the third quarter of  slightly offset by a decrease in the us where sales efforts are concentrated on the ultra max product line

currency risks the company uses the us dollar as the reporting currency for financial statement purposes 
the company conducts business in numerous countries around the world through its international subsidiaries which use local currencies to denominate their transactions  and is therefore  subject to certain risks associated with fluctuating foreign currencies 
the company believes these risks are not significant as its major foreign operations are in western european countries which have relatively stable economies and currencies 
the company monitors its currency exposures but has decided not to hedge its translation exposures due to the high economic costs of such a program and the long term nature of its investments in its international subsidiaries 
translation exposure is the result of translating local currency financial statements into the company s reporting currency 
management has estimated that the net impact of currency fluctuations on the company s results of operations  while slightly unfavorable in fiscal due to the stronger us dollar  was not significant in any of the fiscal years in the three year period ended june the company does have a policy of managing its transaction exposure arising from intercompany product purchase commitments 
the policy provides for the use of forward exchange contracts and options to sell the currencies received from international subsidiaries in settlement of intercompany product purchases 
forward contracts and options are subject to the risk of gain or loss from changes in exchange rates  but these gains or losses are effectively offset by losses or gains on the designated hedged commitments 
the company believes its policy to hedge its transaction exposures has been successful as foreign exchange losses were minimal in fiscal  and interest rate risks and derivatives the company is subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business on various assets  consisting primarily of cash  installment receivables  sales type leases and debt 
generally  the company only uses interest rate agreements to manage its exposure associated with the sale of installment receivables 
the company s interest rate risks related to existing outstanding debt are not significant as a major portion of the company s debt is at reasonably low fixed interest rates 
the company does not enter into speculative derivative transactions or leveraged swap arrangements 
the derivative instruments it does own are not held as investments  and it is the company s intent to hold such instruments for their respective terms 
therefore  changes in their fair values will have no effect on the company s operations  cash flows  or financial position
