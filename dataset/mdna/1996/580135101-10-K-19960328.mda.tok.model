nm not meaningful systemwide sales and restaurants systemwide sales are comprised of sales by restaurants operated by the company  franchisees and affiliates operating under joint venture agreements between mcdonald s and local businesspeople 
the and sales increases were primarily due to expansion 
stronger foreign currencies and higher sales at existing restaurants also contributed to these increases 
sales by company operated restaurants grew at a higher rate than systemwide sales in and for both years  the number of company operated restaurants grew at a higher rate than systemwide restaurants  and for  company operated comparable sales were also stronger than systemwide comparable sales 
average sales by systemwide restaurants open at least one year were  in   higher than in average sales improved due to stronger foreign currencies and higher sales at existing restaurants  partially offset by lower average sales for newer  smaller restaurants 
the company expects that average sales will continue to be affected by an increasing proportion of lower volume sites 
profitable expansion into these sites  consistent with our convenience strategy to gain market share  has been made possible by a low cost approach to restaurant development 
expansion continued at an accelerated pace as  restaurants were added systemwide in  traditional and satellites  compared with  in  traditional and satellites and  in traditional and satellites 
generally  satellite restaurants offer a simplified menu and are smaller in size and sales volume compared to traditional restaurants 
mcdonald s plans to add between  and  restaurants around the world annually in and between  and  of the additions will be traditional restaurants  with approximately two thirds outside of the us the remainder will be satellite restaurants  about half of which will be in the us this higher level of openings is attributable to our low cost approach to restaurant development as well as the potential of our alliances with major oil companies and retailers 
based on our experience with oil alliance sites  we have determined that the majority of future expansion for these venues will be traditional restaurants rather than satellite restaurants as originally planned 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the operating results of satellite restaurants on the same basis as traditional restaurants 
the results of satellites operated by the company are included in sales by and costs of company operated restaurants  while those operated by franchisees are included in revenues from and costs of franchised restaurants 
traditional restaurants opened during the year contributed  million to systemwide sales in  million in and million in satellite restaurants opened during the year contributed million to systemwide sales in and million in total revenues total revenues consist of sales by company operated restaurants and fees from restaurants operated by franchisees and affiliates based on a percent of sales with specified minimum payments 
the minimum fee includes both a rent and service fee amount at a combined rate of approximately of sales for new us franchise arrangements 
prior to  the minimum fee generally was for rent and service fees combined 
fees may vary depending on the type of site and the investment required on the part of the company 
fees paid by franchisees outside of the us vary according to local business conditions 
together with occupancy and operating rights  these fees are stipulated in franchise arrangements that generally have year terms 
accordingly  these fees provide a stable  predictable revenue flow to the company 
revenues grow as restaurants are added and as sales build in existing restaurants 
menu price adjustments affect revenues and sales  however  different pricing structures  new products  promotions and product mix variations among markets make quantifying the impact of menu price adjustments for the system as a whole impractical 
total revenues for and increased due to strong global operating results  positive comparable sales and an increase in the company operated restaurant base through expansion and changes in ownership 
in  of sales by company operated restaurants and of revenues from franchised restaurants were outside of the us  compared with and  respectively  in restaurant margins company operated restaurant margins were of sales in  compared with in and in as a percent of sales  food and paper as well as occupancy and other operating costs increased  while payroll costs remained relatively flat 
as a percent of sales  food and paper as well as occupancy and other operating costs declined  while payroll costs increased 
franchised margin dollars comprised about two thirds of the combined operating margins  the same as in the prior year 
franchised restaurant margins were of applicable revenues  compared with in and in the decreases reflected a higher proportion of leased sites  resulting from accelerated expansion and satellite development  which have financing costs embedded in rent expense  whereas  financing costs for owned sites are reflected in interest expense 
franchised margins include revenues and expenses associated with restaurants operating under business facilities lease arrangements 
under these arrangements the company leases the businesses including equipment to franchisees who have options to purchase the businesses 
while higher fees are charged under these arrangements  margins are generally lower because of equipment depreciation 
when these purchase options are exercised  the resulting gains compensate the company for the lower margins prior to exercise and are included in other operating income expense net 
at year end  restaurants were operating under such arrangements  compared with and at year end and  respectively 
the majority of these restaurants were operated outside of the us general  administrative and selling expenses the and increases were primarily due to strategic global investment spending to support the convenience  value and execution strategies 
the increase was also affected by stronger foreign currencies while the increase included a one time  noncash million charge related to the implementation of a new accounting rule regarding the timing of expensing advertising production costs 
these expenses as a percent of systemwide sales have remained relatively constant and were in  in and in corporate general  administrative and selling expenses which were not allocated to the geographic segments of the business were million in  million in and million in other operating income expense net this category is comprised of transactions that relate to franchising and the foodservice business such as gains on sales of restaurant businesses  equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates  and net gains or losses from property dispositions 
the income increase occurred because of greater income from affiliates  principally japan  partially offset by higher losses on property dispositions 
the income increase reflected higher gains on sales of restaurant businesses and higher income from affiliates  offset in part by higher losses on property dispositions 
gains on sales of restaurant businesses include gains from exercises of purchase options by franchisees operating under business facilities lease arrangements and from sales of company operated restaurants 
as a franchisor  mcdonald s purchases and sells businesses in transactions with franchisees and affiliates in an ongoing effort to achieve the optimal ownership mix in each market 
these transactions and resulting gains are integral to franchising  and as such  are recorded in operating income 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated affiliates is reported after interest expense and income taxes  except for us partnerships which are reported before income taxes 
the company actively participates in  but does not control  these businesses 
net gains or losses from property dispositions result from disposals of excess properties through closings  relocations and other transactions 
operating income the and increases reflected higher combined operating margin dollars and stronger foreign currencies  partially offset by higher general  administrative and selling expenses 
in addition  benefited from higher other operating income 
interest expense the increase was due to higher average debt levels and stronger foreign currencies  partially offset by lower average interest rates 
the decrease was primarily due to lower average interest rates  partially offset by higher average debt levels and stronger foreign currencies 
nonoperating income expense net this category includes interest income  gains and losses related to investments and financings  as well as miscellaneous income and expense 
the amount included million of unrealized losses associated with the company s investment in discovery zone common stock 
these losses were primarily responsible for the decline in us and corporate income before provision for income taxes shown on page also contributing to the consolidated results were higher charges associated with minority interests  partially offset by higher interest income and lower translation losses 
the decrease in nonoperating income reflected higher translation losses  principally from mexico and brazil  losses on investments and higher minority interest charges 
provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate was for  compared with for and for the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in us state income taxes and an increased proportion of earnings from foreign operations 
the company expects its effective income tax rate to be in the range of to  due to lower taxes related to foreign operations 
consolidated net deferred tax liabilities included tax assets  net of valuation allowance  of million in  and million in substantially all tax assets arose in the us and other profitable markets  the majority of which is expected to be realized in future us income tax returns 
net income and net income per common share net income and net income per common share increased each in and and  respectively  in the spread between the percent increase in net income and net income per common share reflected the impact of share repurchase 
in  the impact of share repurchase was offset by the conversion of million shares of series b and c preferred stock into million shares of common stock 
impact of changing foreign currencies while changing foreign currencies affect reported results  mcdonald s lessens short term cash exposures principally by purchasing goods and services in local currencies  financing in local currencies and hedging foreign currency denominated cash flows 
strengthening foreign currencies had a positive impact on systemwide sales  revenues  operating income and net income 
strengthening foreign currencies had a positive impact on systemwide sales and operating income  however  the currency impact on interest expense and higher translation losses in latin america more than offset this benefit  resulting in a reduction in net income

us operations sales restaurant expansion was primarily responsible for increasing sales in in addition  positive comparable sales were driven by the company s continued emphasis on value and customer satisfaction in the form of extra value meals  happy meals and the three tier value program in and ongoing programs such as operation mac attack our advertising campaign and fast  accurate and friendly our initiative to improve customer satisfaction and promotions such as monopoly also aided sales  as did various promotions in five ten years years in millions of dollars ago ago operated by franchisees      operated by the company      operated by affiliates us sales      average sales by total us restaurants open at least one year were  in and  in restaurants there were  restaurants added in the us in traditional and satellites compared with in traditional and satellites and all traditional five years ago 
the us accounted for just over one third of traditional restaurants added globally in and  compared with about half five years ago

us revenues were positively impacted by expansion and positive comparable sales in  and  and reduced by the franchising of certain company operated restaurant businesses in and us company operated margins decreased million in  as lower company operated comparable sales and higher costs more than offset the positive impact of the growth in the number of company operated restaurants 
these margins were of sales in  compared with in and in in  the margin decline was driven by higher payroll costs as a percent of sales resulting from an increase in the average hourly wage rate and increased staffing levels designed to improve customer satisfaction 
in and  the margin benefited from cost reduction efforts and lower commodity costs 
us franchised margins rose million or in  driven by expansion and positive comparable sales 
these margins were of applicable revenues in  compared with in and in franchised margins as a percent of revenues declined in and as the growth in rent expense  resulting from an increase in the proportion of new leased sites  particularly satellite locations  outpaced the growth in franchised revenues 
with the current intensely competitive us operating environment  we expect continuing pressure on company operated margins 
however  while it is difficult to assess the potential effects of legislation and other factors that may affect the industry  the company believes it can maintain annual operating margins as a percent of sales within the historical range of the past ten years by continuing to build sales and reduce costs 
us operating income rose million or in and million or in  and was and of consolidated operating income in and  respectively 
the and increases resulted primarily from higher combined operating margins  partially offset by higher general  administrative and selling expenses in the form of higher employee costs  and other expenditures to support our convenience  value and execution strategies 
us operating income was also impacted by a one time  million charge related to the implementation of a new accounting rule for advertising costs 
operating income included depreciation and amortization of million in  million in and million in while the us market remains intensely competitive  mcdonald s is confident of continued growth in operating income over the long term through expansion  by controlling costs at the developmental  operational and administrative levels  and through a greater emphasis on value and customer satisfaction

new restaurant expenditures increased million or  primarily because of accelerated expansion 
expenditures for existing restaurants were made to achieve higher levels of customer satisfaction and implement technology to improve service and food quality 
in  strategic reinvestment to build sales included million for indoor ronald s playplaces and million for rebuilding and relocating restaurants to adjust to changing demographics  traffic patterns and market opportunities 
over the past five years  million has been invested to replace older buildings with new lower cost  more efficient restaurants 
other properties primarily included expenditures for office buildings and related furnishings 
traditional restaurants in thousands of dollars land building equipment us average development costs      us average development costs increased in primarily due to higher site development and preparation costs combined with investments for indoor ronald s playplaces in more than of new traditional restaurants 
construction efficiencies and a further shift toward smaller  lower cost building designs partially offset these increases 
average development costs have decreased from levels 
initiatives such as the company s new joint venture to develop modular restaurant buildings serve as an example of our commitment to further reduce development costs through standardization  global sourcing and greater economies of scale 
our objective is to profitably expand into more locations  consistent with mcdonald s goal of increasing market share with greater marketwide presence throughout the world 
because real estate ownership yields long term benefits  including the ability to fix occupancy costs  the company purchases new properties and acquires previously leased properties to the extent practical 
the company owned of traditional us sites at year end  compared with five years ago 
most satellite restaurants are leased locations 
operations outside of the us sales sales outside of the us rose in and in due to aggressive expansion  stronger foreign currencies and higher local currency sales at existing restaurants in all geographic segments except canada 
this strong sales growth in was achieved despite weak economies in several markets

in europe  restaurant expansion continued to drive sales growth in austria  england  france  germany  the netherlands and spain 
in latin america  due to the mid economic reforms  brazil s tremendous sales growth continued into results in mexico continued to be impacted by the weak economy and further peso devaluation 
we currently anticipate this trend to continue through at least  however  we believe this market offers long term potential 
canada s sales growth was impacted by a slow economy and decreased consumer retail spending

accounting for the impairment of long lived assets in the first quarter of  the company will adopt statement of financial accounting standard no

this statement requires impairment losses be recognized for long lived assets  whether these assets are held for disposal or continue to be used in operations  when indicators of impairment are present and the fair value of assets are estimated to be less than carrying amounts

while cash generated is significant relative to cash required  the company also has the ability to meet any short term needs through commercial paper borrowings and line of credit agreements 
accordingly  a relatively low current ratio has been purposefully maintained  it was 
at year end the company believes that cash flow measures are meaningful indicators of growth and financial strength  when evaluated in the context of absolute dollars  uses and consistency

to accomplish these objectives  mcdonald s generally finances long term assets with long term debt in the currencies in which the assets are denominated  while remaining flexible to take advantage of changing foreign currencies and interest rates 
over the years  major capital markets and various techniques have been utilized to meet financing requirements and reduce interest expense 
currency exchange agreements have been employed in conjunction with borrowings to obtain desired currencies at attractive rates 
interest rate exchange agreements have been used to effectively convert fixed rate to floating rate debt  or vice versa 
foreign currency denominated debt has been used to lessen the impact of changing foreign currencies on net income and shareholders equity by designating these borrowings as hedges of intercompany financings or the company s long term investments in its foreign subsidiaries and affiliates 
total foreign currency denominated debt  including the effects of currency exchange agreements  was and billion at year end and  respectively 
fixed rate debt as a percent of total debt weighted average annual interest rate foreign currency denominated debt as a percent of total debt total debt as a percent of total capitalization total debt and total shareholders equity the company manages its debt portfolio to respond to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies and accordingly  periodically retires  redeems  and repurchases debt  terminates exchange agreements  and uses derivatives 
the company does not use derivatives with a level of complexity or with a risk higher than the exposures to be hedged and does not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes  all exchange agreements are over the counter instruments 
while changing foreign currencies affect reported results  the company actively hedges selected foreign currencies  primarily to minimize the cash exposure of royalty and other payments received in the us in local currencies 
mcdonald s restaurants also primarily purchase goods and services in local currencies resulting in natural hedges and mcdonald s typically finances in local currencies creating economic hedges 
the company s exposure is diversified within a broad basket of currencies 
at year end  assets in hyperinflationary markets and in mexico were principally financed in us dollars 
the company s largest net asset exposures defined as foreign currency assets less foreign currency liabilities by foreign currency were as follows in millions of dollars december  canadian dollars british pounds sterling australian dollars french francs hong kong dollars netherland guilders austrian schillings moody s and standard poor s have rated mcdonald s debt aa and aa  respectively  since duff phelps began rating the debt in  and currently rates it aa 
at the present time  these strong ratings are important to mcdonald s in the context of our global development plans 
the company has not experienced  nor does it expect to experience  difficulty in obtaining financing or in refinancing existing debt 
at year end  the company and its subsidiaries had billion available under line of credit agreements and million under previously filed shelf registrations available for future debt issuance 
although mcdonald s prefers to own real estate  leases are an alternative financing method 
as in the past  some new properties will be leased 
such leases frequently include renewal and or purchase options 
in the past five years  the company and its affiliates have leased properties related to of us traditional restaurant openings and of traditional restaurant openings outside of the us since  the company has improved its balance sheet by reducing leverage while simultaneously increasing expansion and repurchasing shares 
total shareholders equity total shareholders equity rose million or in  representing of total assets at year end 
stronger foreign currencies increased shareholders equity by million in one technique used to enhance common shareholder value is share repurchase using excess cash flow or debt capacity  while maintaining a strong equity base for future expansion 
mcdonald s has repurchased billion of its common stock  representing million shares  over the past years 
at year end  the market value of shares recorded as common stock in treasury was billion  compared to the cost of billion 
in january  the company announced plans to repurchase billion of its common stock within the next three years  including million remaining under the three year  billion program announced in january in  the company completed a million common share repurchase program begun in returns return on average assets is computed using operating income 
net income less preferred stock dividends net of tax in   and is used to calculate return on average common equity 
month end balances are used to compute both average assets and average common equity 
return on average assets return on average common equity the improvements in return on average assets since reflected better global operating results and a slower rate of asset growth 
the  and improvements in return on average common equity reflected higher levels of share repurchase  whereas the decline in resulted from a lower level of share repurchase as excess cash flow was used to reduce debt 
effects of changing prices inflation mcdonald s has demonstrated an ability to manage inflationary cost increases effectively 
rapid inventory turnover  ability to adjust prices  cost controls and substantial property holdings many of which are at fixed costs and partially financed by debt made cheaper by inflation have enabled mcdonald s to mitigate the effects of inflation 
in hyperinflationary markets  menu board prices typically are adjusted to keep pace  thereby mitigating the effect on reported results
