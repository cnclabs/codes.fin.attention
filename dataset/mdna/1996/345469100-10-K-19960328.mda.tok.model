these securities have different risks than other investment grade securities 
risk of loss upon default by the borrower is greater with these investments than with other corporate or governmental debt securities because these securities are generally unsecured and are often subordinated to other creditors of the issuer

due to the restrictive definition of assets qualifying to be categorized as held to maturity  most of the company s fixed investment securities are considered to be available for sale  and are therefore adjusted to reflect market values 
unrealized investment gains and losses on securities available for sale are credited or charged directly to shareholders equity net of applicable tax provisions or credits 
the net unrealized gain or loss on securities available for sale was an unrealized gain of million at december   an unrealized loss of million at december  and an unrealized gain of million at december  although the company has the general intent and ability to hold most of its fixed maturities to maturity  sales may be made from this category due to changes in market conditions  relative yields available  tax planning and asset liability management considerations
