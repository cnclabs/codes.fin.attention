item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations as reflected in the accompanying financial statements  net income was  in   in and  in net income for decreased when compared to due primarily to lower operating profits within the livestock and commercial and land use divisions 
also affecting net income was the   or 
per share  after tax charge off of producing almond trees destroyed by winter storms during january net income for decreased when compared to net income due to lower operating profits within the livestock and farming divisions as well as the favorable impact in of a  refund from a water district  after tax 
the decrease in operating profits was partially offset by an improvement in operations within the commercial and land use division 
reduced interest income also affected results 
changes in revenues and expenses of registrant s industry segments for the years and are summarized below 
livestock 
livestock operating profits of  in decreased  or almost  when compared to operating results 
the decrease in operating profits is due primarily to increases in cost of sales  and the continuing decline of cattle prices during cattle sales revenue increased  during  which partially offset the increase in cost of sales 
cost of sales increased during due to registrant delaying the sale of approximately  head of cattle from may to october and placing the cattle in feedlots during the summer months 
the extra four months of feedlot costs and an increase in the number of head sold during were primary factors in the increase in cost of sales 
registrant delayed the sale of cattle during due to the low cattle prices during may by delaying the sale  these cattle increased in weight from approximately pounds to approximately  pounds at the time of sale in october 
the increase in weight of cattle sold and the increase in number of cattle sold led to the increase in cattle sales revenue during total cattle sold during were  compared to  during prices received during were approximately per pound less than received during by extending the cattle feeding phase  registrant realized net profits from the sale of those cattle of approximately  more than if the cattle had been sold during may as is normally the case 
during  registrant continued to use the futures and options market to protect the future selling price of cattle 
without the ability to hedge cattle positions  registrant would have sustained a further price erosion of approximately  on the sale of cattle during registrant s goal in hedging its cattle is to protect or create a range of selling prices that in years like allow registrant to recognize a profit on the sale of cattle once all costs are deducted 
the risk in hedging cattle prices is that in those years that prices increase the hedge may limit or cap the potential gains from the increase in price 
net earnings for were also affected by the decision to place ranch raised calves on feed during late summer and not sell until early due to low prices 
this decision pushed revenues that would normally be recognized in into the year is a l s o expected to be difficult financially for livestock producers 
registrant is concerned that cattle prices will stay flat or decrease even further during this inventory correction cycle 
registrant does not expect an improved cattle market until late or early livestock division operating profits of  in were  or less than operating profits 
this decrease in operating profits was due primarily to an increase in the cost of sales of cattle  and to lower prices on cattle sold 
in addition  revenues from the quarter horse program decreased  due to a decrease in sales revenues and horse event revenues 
these unfavorable variances were partially offset by an increase in revenues from cattle sales 
the increase in cost of sales and cattle sales revenue was due to an increase in the number of cattle sold during during   head of cattle were sold compared to  head of cattle during cost of sales expense also increased due to a longer than normal carrying time on a portion of the cattle sold during  which increased the inventory cost of the cattle 
during an additional head of cattle were scheduled to be sold but were held over until so that the cattle could have additional weight gains 
the carry over of cattle into was necessary due to the below normal precipitation during see part i  item business livestock operations for a further discussion of registrant s livestock operations for and future expectations 
farming 
farming operating profits of  in were  or less than operating profits 
the decrease in net earnings is due to the   after tax charge off of destroyed almond trees  lower almond production  reduced pistachio production due to being the alternate bearing year  and to higher cultural costs and water costs 
partially offsetting these unfavorable variances was an increase in almond prices during  the release of the almond reserve  during  and higher grape revenues 
c u l t u ral costs increased approximately  due to unfavorable weather conditions  storm cleanup costs  and to the addition of acres of rubired grapes 
changes in individual crop revenues in compared to were s i gnificant 
grape revenues increased  due to increases in production and prices during of the  favorable variance in grape revenues   is related to the addition of acres of rubired grapes that were purchased during february almond revenues increased  during in spite of lower production due to a increase in prices and to the release of the almond reserve 
walnut revenues increased  due to improved production and a increase in prices during pistachio revenues fell approximately  due to lower production 
pistachio volumes decreased because was the off production year in the alternate year bearing cycle 
during january  a portion of registrant s farming operations suffered damages as a result of high winds that were associated with a series of winter storms 
nearly all of the loss occurred in registrant s producing almond orchards 
approximately acres of trees were uprooted by a combination of high winds and saturated soil conditions due to heavy rainfall 
the lost trees r e p resented of registrant s mature  almond producing orchards 
as a result of the storm damage  registrant recorded a charge to earnings as described above 
registrant incurred only m i n imal damage to its remaining orchards and vineyards 
registrant completed replanting the damaged acreage with almond trees during february the loss of mature trees will affect future revenues until the replanted crops begin full production  which could take three to five years 
registrant expects farming operations to improve during due to higher production from its almond orchards and continued good production within the grape vineyards 
however  with higher production  the price paid for almonds will fall from the all time highs of registrant is continuing to develop additional farming acreage in order to improve future revenues and have new crops in full production to offset the loss of any production in current producing orchards in the future as they mature 
for a further discussion of the farming year and expectations refer to part i  item business farming operations 
farming division operating profits of  during were  or less than operating profits 
the decrease in operating profits was due to lower aggregate crop proceeds of  during  the recognition of the gain of  related to water refunds during  and increased fixed water costs during in addition  revenues included  of favorable pricing adjustments related to the crop which was approximately  greater than crop adjustments recognized in these unfavorable variances were partially offset by reductions in cultural and farming division costs of  during the decrease in farming expense was due to very favorable farming weather during the spring and summer  which allowed registrant to change pest  fertilizer  and irrigation programs 
there were numerous changes in individual crop revenues when comparing and results 
for  grape revenues fell  due to lower prices 
registrant sold all of its grapes to one winery under the second year of a three year contract 
had registrant not contracted for the sale of its grapes in advance  revenues from its grapes would have been even less  due to the down market for generic white grapes 
walnut revenues decreased  due to substantially lower prices and to lower production 
pistachio revenues increased  due to being the on production year in the alternate year bearing cycle 
almond revenues decreased  due primarily to lower p r ices 
the decrease in almond revenues would have been approximately  less if the california almond board had not required a withhold of production 
oil and minerals 
oil and mineral operating profits of  in were  or less than operating profits 
the decrease in operating profits during were due p r i m arily to lower land lease income and to increased professional service fees 
an increase in cement royalties during partially offset the above unfavorable variances 
professional service fees increased due to registrant spending considerable time negotiating with lessees to perform the required field development or abandonment of idle wells 
this process increased the number of operating wells in operation during land lease revenues declined and are expected to continue to decline due to the economics of exploring for oil within california 
registrant s royalty income from oil and gas should improve slightly during due to the return of idled wells to production in late and to the anticipation of improved prices 
as discussed in part i  item business oil and minerals  crude oil prices have been improving due to the lessening of export restrictions on california and alaskan crude oil 
cement royalties increased approximately during due to increases in production 
sand and rock royalties should continue to grow due to the addition of an asphalt plant at one location and the proposed expansion of the second sand and rock lease site 
oil and mineral division operating profits of  in were  or below profits 
the decrease in operating profits was due to lower oil and gas royalties  which were partially offset by increased cement royalties  and increased land lease income 
oil and mineral royalties declined due to lower prices and to the receipt of adjustments related to the sharing of gas processing and t r ansportation costs 
cement royalties increased due to improving prices and higher production 
production increased due to additional construction activity within los angeles which was related to the earthquake 
commercial and land use 
an operating loss of  in compares to a operating loss of  for the commercial and land use division 
the decrease when compared to is due to an increase in professional service fees  and an increase in staffing costs  during partially offsetting these negative variances was an increase in commercial rents and right of way income of  commercial rents increased due to improved traffic flows and to the addition of a n other fast food outlet at the laval road interchange 
professional service costs increased due primarily to legal  legislative  and public affairs activity registrant was involved in related to a proposed major crude oil pipeline through the ranch 
during december registrant completed negotiations with respect to an easement for the crude oil pipeline 
the actual date of start of construction on the pipeline is not known at this time because governmental approvals have not been received and it is not certain they will be received 
upon the start of construction registrant will receive a substantial payment that will be recorded as right of way and easement revenues 
this potential revenue will not be received until construction of the pipeline begins 
see part i  item  properties land planning for further discussion of planning activities 
the commercial and land use division had an operating loss of  in which compares to an operating loss of  in the improvement over was due to a reduction in professional service fees  related to the registrant s long term land planning efforts 
the expense was below due to the timing of planning projects 
registrant will continue to h a ve substantial expense related to future land planning activities see part i  item properties land planning for further discussion of and future planning activities 
commercial rents and right of way rents were comparable to even though percentage rents were below expectations due to low traffic on interstate during january and february because of the january earthquake in los angeles 
interest 
interest income of  during was  or  less than interest income 
the decrease when compared to is due to lower gains on the sale of securities  lower interest rates during and to lower outstanding investment balances 
investment funds continued to decline during due to the purchase of land  the payment of dividends  and to capital expenditures 
interest income during of  declined  or when compared to interest income 
the decrease is due to lower gains on the sale of securities and to lower average outstanding balances of marketable securities 
investment funds have declined due to additional principal payments on long term debt  the payment of dividends  and to capital expenditures 
interest expense increased  during due to the increased use of short term credit lines throughout the year 
short term debt use increased due to the timing of cash flows throughout because of the delays in the sale of cattle and the timing of crop proceeds 
interest expense in and was principally attributable to interest on borrowings used to finance registrant s acre almond and acre wine grape developments  which were developed in corporate expenses 
corporate expenses during increased  or  when compared to expenses 
the increase was due primarily to higher professional service fees  and maintenance fees 
partially offsetting these unfavorable variances was a decrease in staff costs of  professional service costs were higher because of fees related to the chief executive officer search 
staffing costs fell due to the president resigning during the middle of corporate expenses for decreased  or when c o m pared to expenses 
the decrease was primarily attributable to lower professional service fees and legal fees 
inflation 
inflation can have a major impact on registrant s operations 
the farming operations are most affected by escalating costs and unpredictable revenues due to an oversupply of certain crops and very high irrigation water costs 
high fixed water costs related to registrant s farm lands will continue to adversely affect earnings 
prices received by registrant for many of its products are dependent upon prevailing market conditions and commodity prices 
therefore  it is difficult for registrant to accurately predict revenue  just as it cannot pass on cost increases caused by general inflation  except to the extent reflected in market conditions and commodity prices 
impact of accounting change 
registrant will adopt statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
at year end december  registrant will continue to apply apb for the a c c ounting of stock options and provide the appropriate disclosures and pro forma information as described in sfas no 
in january  registrant adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
sfas no 
requires that an enterprise classify all debt securities as either held to maturity  trading  or available for sale 
in addition  if an enterprise has classified its securities as either trading or available for sale it must adjust securities to fair value at each reporting date 
r e gistrant invests in debt securities  consisting of treasuries  government agencies  corporate notes  and mortgage backed securities 
registrant has elected to classify its securities as available for sale 
as of december  the cumulative unrealized fair value adjustment to stockholders equity is an unrealized gain of  net of a tax credit of financial condition 
registrant s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled approximately  at december   a decrease of from the corresponding amount at the end of working capital at the end of was  which is less than a year earlier 
working capital decreased during the year due to capital expenditures  the purchase of land  and the payment of dividends 
registrant has a revolving line of credit of  that as of december  had a balance of  at an interest rate of 
the outstanding balance on registrant s revolving credit line was paid down during january the revolving line of credit is used as a short term cash management tool 
the principal uses of cash and cash equivalents during   and consisted of capital expenditures  purchase of land  payments of long term debt and the payment of dividends 
the accurate forecasting of cash flows by registrant is made more difficult due to the fact that commodity markets set the prices for the majority of registrant s products and the fact that the cost of water changes significantly from year to year as a result of changes in its availability 
registrant  based on its past experience  believes it will have adequate cash flows over the next twelve months to fund internal operations 
during   has been budgeted for capital expenditures  which includes new equipment and improvements to existing facilities 
the capital budget also includes acres of farming development at approximately  see part i  item business farming 
registrant has traditionally funded its growth and capital additions from internally generated funds 
management believes that the combination of short term investments  excess borrowing c a pacity  and capital presently available to it will be sufficient for its near term operations
