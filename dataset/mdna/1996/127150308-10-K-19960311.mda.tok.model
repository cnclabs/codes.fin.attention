in addition  it has been the company s practice to adjust selling prices for inflationary increases in the cost of merchandise 
the amount of property and equipment  which are principally leasehold improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment  along with the related depreciation and amortization  would not be significantly different under inflationary accounting
