this increase in fiscal sales was due primarily to an increase of million in baler sales resulting from the epco acquisition in late fiscal sales of the company s other products remained essentially stable during fiscal gross profit as a percentage of sales declined to for fiscal from for fiscal this decline was due largely to the company s inventory reduction program  increased price competition in the solid waste industry  and certain manufacturing inefficiencies at the georgia and the mcclain ohio facilities 
the union organizing efforts in the georgia facility see item legal proceedings caused significant manufacturing inefficiencies during the past year at that plant  while the manufacturing inefficiencies at the mcclain ohio facility resulted from a failure to rapidly adjust its work force during the first half of the year to compensate for the oversupply of trailers which began during fiscal management expects that the reorganization of the georgia plant will result in an acceptable efficiency level 
the inventory reduction program  begun during march  resulted in a million reduction in inventory levels at september  management believes that this program will have a positive effect on both interest expense and the normal carrying costs associated with inventory during fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses declined to as a percentage of net sales during fiscal compared to for fiscal interest expense increased to of net sales during fiscal compared to during fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from greater borrowing to fund the company s increased leasing activities and the cost of carrying the inventory built up during fiscal comparison of year ended september  to year ended september  net sales for the fiscal year ended september  reached million reflecting a increase over sales for fiscal of million 
this increase in sales for fiscal was attributable to container sales  exclusive of intermodal and sludge containers  increasing by million for the period and garbage and recycling truck bodies sales increasing by million for the period 
sales of other product lines remained static or declined in comparison to fiscal  most notably trailer sales which declined million and intermodal and sludge containers sales which declined million 
the decline in trailer sales is attributable to a temporary over supply of trailers by end users and a restructuring of the company s sales force 
management expects the restructuring of the trailer sales force to have a positive effect on sales commencing in the second quarter of fiscal the decline in intermodal and sludge containers sales is primarily due to an over supply of intermodal and sludge containers in rental fleet markets 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for fiscal compared to for the gross profit margins for fiscal are lower than originally forecasted as a result of increased costs incurred for raw materials  principally steel and aluminum which were not fully recoverable due to intense pricing competition within the solid waste industry  and start up expenses incurred in transferring production of one of the product lines from one manufacturing facility to another facility 
steel prices declined in the latter part of the fourth quarter of fiscal and this decline is expected to have a positive effect on gross profit margins in the latter part of the first quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased modestly to for fiscal compared to for fiscal interest expense as a percentage of net sales increased to of net sales for fiscal compared to of net sales in fiscal as a result of increased long term debt
