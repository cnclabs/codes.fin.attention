sfas requires the company to assess the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of oil and gas properties on a property by property basis 
if an impairment is indicated based on undiscounted expected future cash flows  then a loss is recognized sufficient to bring net capitalized costs down to discounted expected future cash flows 
the decline in net income also resulted from falling natural gas prices and sharply increased financing costs incurred prior to the reduction in outstanding debt accomplished during the latter half of revenues from production operations less direct operating expenses in were million  slightly above the level 
average daily production during was  boe  up from levels  although the average product price received decreased by to per boe 
the production increase resulted primarily from newly drilled wells placed on production in late and early in  the company placed wells on sales  including in the dj basin of colorado  in the austin chalk area of texas  in the green river basin of wyoming and six in the piceance basin of western colorado

senior debt was significantly reduced during the last half of the year with the proceeds from the sale of the wattenberg facilities and miscellaneous oil and gas properties 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense increased during the increase resulted from the growth in oil and gas production  offset somewhat by a reduction in the average depletion  depreciation and amortization rate per boe to in from in the average depletion rate is expected to increase to approximately per boe in based on the recent decrease in reserves

total production should exceed million barrels in  based on planned drilling activity 
an mile pipeline to connect the logovskoye southernmost field to the perm refining center has been completed
