net revenues fiscal year change fiscal year change fiscal year from prior year from prior year net revenues in millions the increases in revenue in fiscal and were primarily attributable to increases in unit volume shipments of portable graphics controllers 
the majority of the company s sales are derived from portable graphics controller products which comprised  and of the company s sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
export sales are sales made to foreign customers and to the overseas manufacturing facilities of domestic customers 
export sales were  and of net sales for fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales to foreign customers are denominated in us dollars 
three customers accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net sales in fiscal three customers accounted for  and  respectively  of the company s net sales in fiscal no customer accounted for more than of the company s net sales for fiscal gross margin fiscal year change fiscal year change fiscal year from prior year from prior year gross margin in millions percentage of net revenues the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to an improved mix of products including higher margin portable graphics accelerators 
operating expense fiscal year change fiscal year change fiscal year from prior year from prior year in millions research development percentage of net revenues selling  general administrative percentage of net revenues restructuring recovery percentage of net revenues research and development expenses research and development expenses increased in absolute dollars in both fiscal and mainly due to increases in engineering staffing levels  product prototyping and outside service costs 
the page company expects these expenses to increase in absolute dollars as it invests in new hardware and software product development including d graphics and mpeg ii technology 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased in absolute dollars in both fiscal and fiscal however  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased from year to year as sales grew at a faster rate than spending 
the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to higher commissions paid to sales representatives as the result of higher revenues 
restructuring recovery the company received million in fiscal and million in fiscal as principal payments against a note receivable recorded in respect of the sale of certain of the company s product lines which were discontinued and fully reserved as restructuring charges in fiscal the note was paid in full in november  because the restructuring plans that were reserved for in prior years were substantially completed  the company also recorded the remaining reserve balance of million as income in fiscal interest income and other  net other income was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal other income in fiscal included a million gain related to the sale of land and a million gain from the sale of amd stock see notes to consolidated financial statements short term investments 
other income in fiscal included proceeds from the sale of an equity investment 
income taxes the company recorded million and million of income tax provisions reflecting annual effective tax rates of and in fiscal and  respectively 
the rates are substantially lower than the statutory income tax rate as a result of utilization of the company s net operating loss carryforwards 
the provisions for fiscal and reflect certain federal alternative minimum tax and state tax obligations 
the company recorded million in tax benefits in fiscal the company resolved a number of tax issues in fiscal and  as a result  recorded a tax benefit of million related to taxes which were previously provided for these issues 
the company has provided a valuation allowance for all the deferred tax assets on the basis that realization is not reasonably assured 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million on june   an increase of million compared to million on june  this increase was primarily attributable to cash generated from operating activities of million during fiscal and proceeds from the sale of land for million in december  the increase was partially offset by usage of cash for deposits to two foundries to obtain commitments for the supply of additional wafers 
short term investments as of june  included million of amd common stock which was converted from nexgen common stock as a result of the merger of the two companies 
the company sold  shares of such stock for million during the third quarter of fiscal the company plans to sell the remaining stock at appropriate valuations 
during fiscal  other assets increased million from million on june  the increase was primarily attributable to the payment of cash deposits relating to foundry capacity agreements with taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company tsmc and chartered semiconductor manufacturing pte ltd csm which were entered into during the second quarter of fiscal these agreements require deposits totaling million and million  respectively  to be paid by the company 
during fiscal  the company made deposits totaling million under these agreements 
the company is required to make another two deposits in an aggregated amount of million during the second half of calendar year the deposit under the agreement with tsmc will be fully paid by the end of calendar year the company will pay the remaining balance of million under the agreement with csm in the amount of million in each of calendar years and the company expects to finance the remaining deposits from existing cash balances and funds generated from operations 
under the tsmc agreement  some of the deposit will be recovered over the term of the contract as credits against wafer purchases 
the remainder of the tsmc deposit and all of the csm deposit will be recovered at the expiration of the agreements 
page the company s capital requirements consist primarily of financing working capital items and funding operational activities 
the company has agreements with three banking institutions for a combined total of million in unsecured lines of credit 
these line of credit agreements will expire at various times from august through october there was no borrowing against these lines of credit as of june  these agreements contain certain covenants related to financial performance and condition  and the ability to borrow under such lines is subject to compliance with such covenants 
the company expects that its existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  bank lines of credit and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet the company s capital and operating requirements for at least the coming fiscal year 
factors affecting future operating results the company expects its revenues will increase in the next quarter and its gross margins will remain at approximately the level achieved in the most recent quarter 
in order to maintain its present market position and to expand the markets in which the company can participate  the company expects to increase its investment in hardware and software engineering  particularly in the areas of d graphics  new memory technologies such as sdram  and mpeg ii technology 
the company s revenues  gross margin and other operating results have been and will continue to be affected by a wide variety of factors that could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and business during any particular period 
these factors include the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter  the rescheduling or cancellation of orders by the company s customers  gain or loss of any strategic relationships or design wins with customers  the company s ability to predict product demand and manage its inventory  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  the timing of qualification by its customers of the company s products from different foundry suppliers  new product introductions by the company s competitors  the company s ability and timing in introducing new products and technologies  market acceptance of the company s and its customers products  supply constraints and price or other fluctuations for other components such as portable display screens and memory devices incorporated into its customers products  competitive pressures on selling prices  changes in product or customer mix  and the amount and timing of expenditures for research and development and for selling  general and administrative functions 
the company does not own or operate a wafer fabrication facility  and all of its semiconductor device requirements are supplied by third party foundries 
all of the company s semiconductor products are currently assembled and tested by third party vendors 
the company s reliance on subcontractors to manufacture  assemble and test its products involves significant risks  including reduced control over delivery schedules  quality assurance  manufacturing yields and cost 
delays in delivery of the company s products  problems with quality or yields  cost increases and other factors beyond the company s control could result in the loss of customers  reductions in the company s revenues or other material adverse effects on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s manufacturing and assembly subcontractors are primarily in asia 
many of the company s customers also manufacture in asia or subcontract their manufacturing to asian companies 
the concentration of the company s manufacturing and selling activities in asia poses risks that could adversely affect demand for and supply of the company s products including foreign currency fluctuations and economic and trade policies which could affect the relative competitiveness of customers end products 
the company expects to obtain access to and qualify new foundries or new production lines at established foundries which employ advanced manufacturing and process technologies 
the majority of the company s new products will utilize advanced process geometries  particularly u and u  in order to achieve high performance and lower production costs 
the company generally qualifies its product in a single foundry during the initial production phase and attempts to qualify a second foundry during production ramp up 
the company has in the past experienced delays in connection with the qualification of new products and new foundries 
failure to qualify and obtain adequate production volumes of its products on a timely basis would delay product introduction and delivery to the company s customers 
delays  as well as cost increases or quality and yield problems  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
during the company s customers initial or pre production phase of manufacturing  the customer performs its own manufacturing validation and testing which qualify the company s products for production use 
the company s products are extremely complex semiconductor devices 
the company establishes and implements test specifications and imposes quality standards upon its suppliers and also performs separate application based compatibility and system testing for its products 
however  its customers may discover defects in the company s products related to their particular application 
page to the extent that the company is unable to remedy defects or provide product that meets its customers manufacturing qualification processes  the company may experience lower revenues and excess inventories which could have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
a number of factors have recently resulted in reduced average order lead times from customers 
these factors include customers perception that product is more readily available to them because foundry capacity is more readily available to semiconductor suppliers than it was in the recent past  and customers reluctance to place long range orders due to their diminishing ability to predict their customers demand 
the company is currently receiving orders for delivery of product primarily during the next ninety days  whereas in the past  a higher proportion of orders were for delivery as many as one hundred eighty days in the future 
this shortened lead time makes forecasting by the company of product requirements more difficult 
the company must place non cancelable orders to purchase its products from its foundries on a three month rolling basis 
accordingly  the company could experience an unexpected shortfall in product availability or unexpected excess product inventory 
in addition  the reduced order lead time from customers makes it more difficult for the company to predict future revenues and operating results 
if sales and shipments in any quarter do not occur as expected  revenue could be reduced and expense and inventory levels could be disproportionately high  and the company s business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
a limited number of customers account for a substantial portion of the company s net sales 
the company expects that sales to relatively few customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of its revenues for the foreseeable future 
some companies providing products to the desktop pc market have recently experienced or expect to experience lower results of operations due to various issues affecting the desktop pc market 
as a result  many companies are reevaluating product strategies and expected unit volumes 
in addition  certain companies have reportedly accumulated large amounts of inventory and are pursuing aggressive pricing strategies to reduce inventories 
the company s business is primarily in the portable computer segment of the market which has not been affected to the same extent 
however  in the event that one or more of the company s major customers were to cancel and or substantially reschedule orders for significant quantities of product  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
the company relies on obtaining and maintaining design wins for its products with leading personal computer manufacturers 
in the event that the company s competitors have or introduce product features and or performance which are perceived as valuable by the market but are not in the company s products  the company could lose current design wins or not acquire new design wins 
in addition  other factors such as internal product development delays  aggressive competition and intangible factors affecting customer relationships could also adversely impact design wins 
to the extent that the company is unable to retain existing design wins or to acquire new design wins and the associated revenues for the company s existing and future products  there could be a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
during calendar  the semiconductor industry experienced constraints on available production 
the company  like many fabless semiconductor companies  entered into long term deposit agreements with wafer foundry suppliers to ensure guaranteed access to capacity 
although production capacity for advanced processes such as u appears to be limited  production capacity for more mature processes now appears to be less constrained 
the company s capacity commitment contracts contain provisions that obligate the company to purchase minimum quantities of wafers from these suppliers 
to the extent that the company must utilize production capacity at certain foundries to fulfill its long term commitments  the company may pay a higher price for product than that available from other suppliers  and this could have an adverse impact on the company s gross margins and results of operations 
the pc semiconductor market is generally characterized by price declines over time as new competitors enter and as new semiconductor process technologies enable lower cost manufacturing 
in addition  rapid price declines may occur when current supply exceeds demand 
there can be no assurance that the company will not experience increased price competition  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company expects its competitors to aggressively price alternative solutions to attempt to gain or maintain market share 
certain of the company s competitors have reportedly pursued aggressive pricing strategies to reduce accumulated inventories of product for the desktop pc market 
although it appears that supply to the portable computer market has not been impacted by an accumulation of inventory  to the extent that the company must reduce prices to meet competition  maintain market share or meet customer requirements  the gross margin percentages achieved in recent periods may not be sustainable 
the largest portion of the company s sales is comprised of portable graphics accelerators 
the company expects that the majority of its revenues will continue to be from sales of those products during fiscal while the market page for pcs in general and portable computers in particular has recently experienced substantial growth  the overall industry has historically been cyclical and seasonal  and there can be no assurance that growth rates experienced in prior periods will continue in the future
