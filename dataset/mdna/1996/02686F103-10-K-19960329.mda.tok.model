results of operations versus net earnings decreased for as compared to primarily as a result of the gain recognized on the disposition of the insured mortgage on one east delaware in january also contributing to the decrease in net earnings was a decrease in interest and other income  as discussed below 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in mortgage investment income  as discussed below 
mortgage investment income increased for as compared to due to increases in total invested assets throughout  the full benefit which was realized in the increase in total invested assets is attributable to the reinvestment of net proceeds from the disposition of the insured mortgages on one east delaware and victoria pointe apartments phase ii  which were received in december and january and reinvested during the first three quarters of interest and other income decreased for as compared to primarily due to the short term investment of net disposition proceeds in early prior to reinvestment in acquired insured mortgages  as previously discussed

partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in mortgage investment income  as described below 
mortgage investment income decreased for as compared to this decrease was primarily due to the disposition of the mortgages on one east delaware and victoria pointe apartments  the proceeds of which were not reinvested until the first three quarters of also contributing to the decrease in mortgage investment income was a reduction in mortgage interest rates on acquired insured mortgages purchased during as compared to the mortgage interest rates on those insured mortgages which were disposed of in late and early interest and other income increased for as compared to primarily due to the short term investment of net disposition proceeds prior to reinvestment in acquired insured mortgages  as previously discussed

also contributing to the increase in general and administrative expenses was an amendment to the expense reimbursement agreement between the aim partnerships and ifi  effective april  the effect of this amendment was to reduce the expense reimbursement the partnership receives from ifi to reflect the reduction in the partnership s coinsured loans since the execution of the original reimbursement agreement in this reimbursement is presented as a reduction of general and administrative expenses on the accompanying statements of operations for the years ended december   and the decrease in the expense reimbursement is offset by a decrease in interest expense to affiliate  as discussed below

the mortgages underlying the fha insured certificates  gnma mortgage backed securities  and fha insured loans are non recourse first liens on multifamily residential developments or retirement homes 
the following is a discussion of the partnership s mortgage investments  along with the risks related to each type of investment a 
fully insured originated insured mortgages and acquired insured mortgages the partnership s investment in fully insured originated insured mortgages consisted of seven and eight fha insured loans  as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   these investments had an aggregate amortized cost of  an aggregate face value of  and an aggregate fair value of  as of december   these investments had an aggregate amortized cost of  an aggregate face value of  and an aggregate fair value of  the partnership s investment in fully insured acquired insured mortgages consisted of gnma mortgage backed securities  fha insured certificates and fha insured loan as of december  and as of december   these investments had an aggregate amortized cost of  an aggregate face value of  and an aggregate fair value of  as of december   these investments had an aggregate amortized cost of  an aggregate face value of  and an aggregate fair value of  as of march   all of the partnership s fully insured mortgage investments are current with respect to the payment of principal and interest 
in december   the partnership received net proceeds of  from the prepayment of the mortgage on lakewood villas  a fully insured fha insured loan  and recognized a gain of  as shown on the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended december  the net proceeds are expected to be distributed may  in addition to base interest payments from fully insured originated insured mortgages  the partnership is entitled to additional interest based on a percentage of the net cash flow from the underlying development and of the net proceeds from the refinancing  sale or other disposition of the underlying development referred to as participations 
during the years ended december   and  the partnership received additional interest of   and  respectively  from the fully insured participations 
these amounts are included in mortgage investment income on the accompanying statements of operations 
in the case of fully insured originated insured mortgages and acquired insured mortgages  the partnership s maximum exposure for purposes of determining loan losses would generally be approximately of the unpaid principal balance of the originated insured mortgage or acquired insured mortgage an assignment fee charged by fha at the date of a default  plus the unamortized balance of acquisition fees and closing costs paid in connection with the acquisition of the insured mortgage and the loss of approximately days accrued interest 
coinsured mortgages under the hud coinsurance program  both hud and the coinsurance lender are responsible for paying a portion of the insurance benefits if a mortgagor defaults and the sale of the development collateralizing the part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued mortgage produces insufficient net proceeds to repay the mortgage obligation 
in such case  the coinsurance lender will be liable to the partnership for the first part of such loss in an amount up to of the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage as of the date foreclosure proceedings are instituted or the deed is acquired in lieu of foreclosure 
for any loss greater than of the outstanding principal balance  the responsibility for paying the insurance benefits will be borne on a pro rata basis  by hud and by the coinsurance lender 
while the partnership is due payment of all amounts owed under the mortgage  the coinsurance lender is responsible for the timely payment of principal and interest to the partnership 
the coinsurance lender is prohibited from entering into any workout arrangement with the borrower without the partnership s consent and must file a claim for coinsurance benefits with hud  upon default  if the partnership so directs 
as an ongoing hud approved coinsurance lender  and under the terms of the participation documents  the coinsurance lender is required to satisfy certain minimum net worth requirements as set forth by hud 
however  it is possible that the coinsurance lender s potential liability for loss on these developments  and others  could exceed its hud required minimum net worth 
in such case  the partnership would bear the risk of loss if the coinsurance lenders were unable to meet their coinsurance obligations 
in addition  hud s obligation for the payment of its share of the loss could be diminished under certain conditions  such as the lender not adequately pursuing regulatory violations of the borrower or the failure to comply with other terms of the mortgage 
however  the general partner is not aware of any conditions or actions that would result in hud diminishing its insurance coverage 
as of december  and  the former managing general partner  on behalf of the partnership  had invested in seven fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages 
as of december   two of the seven fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages are coinsured by an unaffiliated third party coinsurance lender under the hud coinsurance program 
the following is a discussion of actual and potential performance problems with respect to the partnership s coinsured mortgage investments 
coinsured by third party the originated insured mortgages on the villas and st 
charles place phase ii are coinsured by patrician 
as of december  and december   the partnership s investment in the mortgage on the villas had an amortized cost of  and  respectively  a face value of  and  respectively  and a fair value of  and  respectively 
as of march   the mortgagor has made payments of principal and interest due on the original mortgage through july  and has made payments of principal and interest due under a modification agreement through august patrician is litigating the case in bankruptcy court while negotiating a modification agreement with the borrower 
the partnership s investment in the mortgage on st 
charles place phase ii had an amortized cost equal to its face value of  and  as of december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  this mortgage had a fair value of  and  respectively 
these amounts represent the part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued partnership s approximate ownership interest in the mortgage 
the remaining ownership interest is held by american insured mortgage investors lp series aim  an affiliate of the partnership 
as of march   the mortgagor has made payments of principal and interest due on the mortgage through may to the partnership 
patrician is litigating the case in bankruptcy court while negotiating a modification agreement with the borrower 
the general partner intends to continue to oversee the partnership s interests in these mortgages to ensure that patrician meets its coinsurance obligations 
the general partner s assessment of the realizability of the villas and st 
charles place phase ii mortgages is based on the most recent information available  and to the extent these conditions change or additional information becomes available  then the general partner s assessment may change 
however  the general partner does not believe that there would be a material adverse impact on the partnership s financial condition or its results of operations should patrician be unable to comply with its full coinsurance obligation 
coinsured by affiliate as of december  and  the partnership held investments in five and two fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages  respectively  where the coinsurance lender is ifi  an affiliate of the partnership 
two of these mortgage investments were originated by the former managing general partner 
as structured by the former managing general partner  with respect to these mortgages  the partnership bears the risk of loss upon default for ifi s portion of the coinsurance loss 
the originated insured mortgages on carmen drive estates the forest  woodbine at lakewood apartments and woodland hills apartments were previously coinsured by m west mortgage corporation m west  a third party coinsurance lender 
during the fourth quarter of  the partnership was informed that m west was liquidating its assets and intended to assign the mortgage servicing rights related to these mortgages to another coinsurance lender  whitehall funding  inc whitehall 
the partnership successfully contested this transfer and obtained a court order mandating the transfer of the mortgage servicing rights related to these three coinsured loans to ifi 
this transfer was completed during the second quarter of the partnership bears the risk of loss upon default for ifi s portion of the coinsurance loss 
as of december   receivables and other assets  as shown on the accompanying balance sheet  includes approximately  due from m west with respect to these loans 
as of march   claims for damages against m west and whitehall are still pending 
as of march   these five ifi coinsured mortgages  as shown in the table below  were current with respect to the payment of principal and interest  except for the mortgage on spring lake village  for which the mortgagor has made payments of principal and interest through july in february  this mortgage was modified a second time to reduce the interest rate to through december  increasing to for and for all subsequent years 
the general partner does not anticipate that this modification will have a material adverse impact on the partnership s financial statements 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the general partner believes there is adequate collateral value underlying these coinsured mortgages 
accordingly  no loan losses were recognized on these mortgages during the years ended december  and  except as described below in connection with a mortgage modification during the year ended december  as of december  and  these five investments had an aggregate fair value of  and  respectively 
part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued amortized face amortized face loan losses recognized cost value cost value for the year ended december  december  december  december  december  december  pembrook apartments     spring lake village a      a carmen drive estates b     woodbine at lakewood apartments b     woodland hills apartments b     a in march  the mortgage note was amended to reduce the mortgage interest rate from to 
in connection with the refinancing  the partnership recognized a loan loss of  on the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended december   primarily representing the unamortized balance of acquisition and closing costs paid in connection with the origination of this mortgage 
as discussed above  the general partner negotiated a second modification of this mortgage during february b as discussed above  these mortgages were coinsured by a third party coinsurance lender as of december  in connection with the fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages  the partnership has sought  in addition to base interest payments  additional interest commonly termed participations based on a percentage of the net cash flow from the development and the net proceeds from the refinancing  sale or other disposition of the underlying development 
all of the fha insured certificates secured by coinsured mortgages contain such participations 
during the years ended december   and  the partnership received additional interest of   and  respectively  from the coinsured participations 
these amounts are included in mortgage investment income on the accompanying statements of operations 
b 
asset held for sale under coinsurance program as of december   the former managing general partner  on behalf of the partnership  had invested in one coinsured mortgage  one east delaware  which was accounted for as an asset held for sale under coinsurance program ahfs 
in january  the partnership received net proceeds of  from the prepayment of this mortgage and recognized a gain of  as shown on the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended december  the partnership reinvested the net disposition proceeds in fully insured acquired insured mortgages during liquidity and capital resources the partnership s operating cash receipts  derived from payments of principal and interest on insured mortgages  plus cash receipts from interest on short term investments  were sufficient during to meet operating requirements 
the basis for paying distributions to unitholders is net proceeds from mortgage dispositions and cash flow from operations  which includes regular interest income and principal from insured mortgages 
although insured part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued mortgages yield a fixed monthly mortgage payment once purchased  the cash distributions paid to the unitholders will vary during each quarter due to the fluctuating yields in the short term money market where the monthly mortgage payments received are temporarily invested prior to the payment of quarterly distributions  the reduction in the asset base and monthly mortgage payments due to monthly mortgage payments received or mortgage dispositions  variations in the cash flow attributable to the delinquency or default of insured mortgages and professional fees and foreclosure costs incurred in connection with those insured mortgages and variations in the partnership s operating expenses 
if necessary  the partnership has the right to establish reserves either from the net proceeds of the offering or from cash flow as defined in the partnership agreement 
however  the partnership generally intends to distribute substantially all of its cash flow from operations 
if any reserves are deemed to be necessary by the partnership  they will be invested in short term  interest bearing investments 
the partnership anticipates that reserves generally would only be necessary in the event the partnership elected to foreclose on an originated insured mortgage insured by fha and take over the operations of the underlying development 
in such case  there may be a need for additional capital 
since foreclosure proceedings can be expensive and time consuming  the partnership expects that it will generally assign the fully insured originated insured mortgages to hud for insurance proceeds rather than initiate foreclosure 
in the case of an originated insured mortgage insured under the hud coinsurance program  the likelihood of foreclosure and the potential need for reserves exists since these coinsured mortgages generally cannot be assigned to hud and the coinsurance lender would be required to acquire title to the property and hold the property for months or until an earlier sale in order to realize the benefit of hud insurance 
the determination of whether to assign the mortgage to hud or institute foreclosure procedures or whether to set aside any reserves will be made on a case by case basis by the general partner  the advisor and the sub advisor to the partnership 
as of december  and  the partnership had not set aside any reserves 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities decreased for as compared to this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in receivables and other assets during as a result of the receipt in january of the remaining net disposition proceeds related to the disposition of the mortgage on victoria pointe apartments phase ii and receipt of accrued interest related to the mortgage on one east delaware 
net cash provided by investing activities increased for as compared to  primarily due to the investment in of approximately million in insured mortgages  which was partially offset by the receipt in of net disposition proceeds of approximately million from the disposition of the insured mortgage on one east delaware 
no insured mortgages were acquired during also contributing to the increase in net cash provided by investing activities  was the receipt in of net proceeds of approximately million related to the prepayment of the mortgage on lakewood villas during net cash used in financing activities decreased for as compared to this decrease was primarily due to the distribution of accrued  but part ii item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued previously undistributed  interest from the disposition of the mortgage on one east delaware 
cash flow versus net cash provided by operating activities increased for as compared to this increase was primarily due to the receipt in january of the remaining net disposition proceeds related to the december disposition of the insured mortgage on victoria pointe apartments phase ii and receipt of accrued interest related to the one east delaware disposition 
also contributing to the increase in were non recurring payments made in on certain loans accounted for as ahfs loans and an increase in interest and other income and a decrease in asset management fees  as previously discussed 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in mortgage investment income and an increase in general and administrative expenses  as discussed above 
net cash used in investing activities increased for as compared to due to the investment of approximately million in acquired insured mortgages  which was partially offset by the receipt of net disposition proceeds of approximately million from the disposition of the insured mortgage on one east delaware 
net cash used in financing activities increased for the year ended december  as compared to as a result of an increase in distributions paid to unitholders 
this increase was primarily due to the distribution of proceeds from the disposition of the insured mortgage on one east delaware
