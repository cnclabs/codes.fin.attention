the purpose of the following discussion and analysis is to explain the major factors and variances between periods of the company s results of operations 
this analysis should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the accompanying notes which begin on page introduction a majority of the company s revenue are derived from the production and licensing of television programming 
the company s television programming is licensed to the major television networks  cable networks  program distributors  domestic and foreign syndicators and advertisers 
the company also receives production fees from program buyers who retain ownership of the programing 
in addition  the company derives revenue from the rerun broadcast of its programs on network and cable television and in foreign markets as well as the licensing of its media and film archives to third parties for use in feature films and television movies  specials and commercials 
the company  on a limited basis  also develops theatrical films in association with established studios that generally provide the financing necessary for production 
the company also derives substantial revenue from its entertainment related businesses which include restaurants dick clark restaurants  inc 
and its subsidiaries and corporate events and production dick clark corporate productions  inc 
these businesses  on a combined basis  contributed approximately  and to the company s consolidated revenue for the fiscal years ended june    and  respectively 
general license fees for the production of television programming are generally paid to the company pursuant to license agreements during production and upon availability and delivery of the completed program or shortly thereafter 
revenue from network and cable television license agreements are recognized for financial statement purposes upon availability and delivery of each program or episode in the case of a series 
revenue from rerun broadcast both domestic and foreign are recognized for each program when it becomes contractually available for broadcast 
production costs of television programs are capitalized and charged to operations on an individual program basis in the ratio that the current year s gross revenue bear to management s estimate of the total revenue for each program from all sources 
substantially all television production costs are amortized in the initial year of delivery  except for successful television series and television movies where there is likely to be future revenue earned in domestic syndication and other markets 
successful television series and television movies can achieve substantial revenue from rerun broadcasts in both foreign and domestic markets after their initial broadcast  thereby allowing a portion of the production costs to be amortized against future revenue 
distribution costs of television programs are expensed in the period incurred 
depending upon the type of contract  revenue for dick clark corporate productions  inc 
are recognized when the services are completed for a live event  or when a tape or film is delivered to a customer  or when services are completed pursuant to a particular phase of a contract which provides for periodic payments 
costs of corporate event productions are capitalized and expensed as revenue is recognized 
liquidity and capital resources the company s capital resources are more than adequate to meet current working capital requirements 
the company had cash and marketable securities of approximately  as of june  compared to  as of june  the company has no outstanding bank borrowings or other indebtedness for borrowed money 
marketable securities consist primarily of investments in united states treasury bills and treasury notes 
in fiscal year  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
this statement requires investments in debt and equity securities  other than debt securities classified as held to maturity  to be reported at fair value 
however  because the company classifies investments in marketable securities as held to maturity  it will continue to carry its investments at cost 
historically  the company has funded its investment in television program costs primarily through installment payments of license fees and minimum guaranteed license payments from program buyers 
to the extent the company produces television movies and television series  the company may be required to finance the portion of its program costs for these programs not covered by guaranteed license payments from program buyers known in the television industry as deficit financing 
none of the company s television production in fiscal or required any material deficit financing on behalf of the company 
the company does not anticipate incurring any material deficit financing of programs which are currently in development 
net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fluctuations in cash provided by operations and cash used for investing activities for those years primarily reflect general increases and decreases in production activity and the construction of the dick clark s american bandstand grill restaurant in cincinnati  ohio in fiscal and two other restaurants in fiscal the company expects that the opening of additional american bandstand grill restaurants will be financed from available capital and or alternative financing methods such as joint ventures and limited recourse borrowings 
the company anticipates opening four additional locations in fiscal at an estimated capital investment of million which will be funded directly by the company without using such alternative methods 
capital requirements for the company s corporate events and production business  dick clark corporate productions  inc  are anticipated to be immaterial to the company s overall capital position in fiscal the company expects that its available capital base and cash generated from operations will be more than sufficient to meet its cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
results of operations revenue revenue for the year ended june  were  compared to  for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  the increase in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to the delivery of a new five day per week talk show series delivered in fiscal the increase is further explained by increased revenue associated with the company s corporate production business  an improved contract for one of its annual specials as well as the delivery in fiscal of a movie for television which did not occur in fiscal the decrease in revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to the delivery of one time anniversary and tribute specials in fiscal year  as well as reduced revenue from the company s corporate events and production business 
this decrease is further explained by a reduction in the number of movies for television produced by the company in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in revenue was offset in part by an increase in revenue generated by the company s restaurant business principally due to the opening of two dick clark s american bandstand grill restaurants in april and may of during fiscal  revenue from a five day per week talk show series represented approximately of total revenue and revenue recognized from a recurring annual special represented approximately of total revenue 
during fiscal  revenue from a recurring annual special represented approximately of total revenue 
during fiscal  revenue from a recurring annual special represented approximately of total revenue 
no other production or project accounted for more than of total revenue for fiscal  or gross profits gross profit as a percentage of revenue was  and for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross profits as a percentage of revenue in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily attributable to lower gross profit as a percentage of sales associated with the new five day per week television talk show series 
talk show series in their first year of release typically earn small gross profits as a percentage of sales 
this syndicated five day per week talk show series was in its first year of release 
in fiscal  the decrease in gross profits as a percentage of sales is further explained by a one time project for a customer of dick clark corporate productions  which contributed lower gross profits as a percentage of the contracted revenue due to the size and nature of the project 
other minority interest expense increased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the license of the rebroadcast rights to episodes of the previously produced super bloopers and new practical jokes 
minority interest expense decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the rebroadcast of previously produced super bloopers and new practical jokes during fiscal  which resulted in higher gross profits contributed by the c c joint venture during that period 
there were no such rebroadcasts in fiscal the c c joint venture  of which the company has a interest  produced the super bloopers and new practical jokes television specials 
the bloopers specials currently being produced by the company do not include the practical joke segments and are owned by the company and there is  therefore  no minority interest expense associated with their production 
income taxes in connection with the implementation of statement of financial accounting standards no 
during fiscal the company recorded  of income which represents the cumulative effect of this accounting change 
general certain statements in the foregoing management s discussion and analysis the md a are not historical facts or information and certain other statements in the md a are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including  without limitation  the company s ability to develop and sell television programming  timely completion of negotiations for new restaurant sites and the ability to construct  finance and open new restaurants and to attract new corporate productions clients  and such competitive and other business risks as from time to time may be detailed in the company s securities and exchange commission reports
