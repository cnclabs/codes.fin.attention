item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
solectron s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those factors set forth under risks and uncertainties below 
general solectron s net sales are derived from sales to electronics systems original equipment manufacturers oems 
the majority of solectron s customers compete in the telecommunications  computer peripherals  workstation  and personal computer sectors of the electronics industry segment 
solectron uses advanced manufacturing technologies in assembly and manufacturing management of complex printed circuit boards and electronics systems 
solectron also provides pre manufacturing and post manufacturing services 
a discussion of some of the potential fluctuations in operating results is discussed under risks and uncertainties 
solectron s operating results are affected by a number of factors  including the material content and volume of products built  manufacturing efficiencies  utilization of capacity  start up costs associated with new customer projects  the degree of turnkey manufacturing  and price competition 
turnkey manufacturing currently represents a substantial portion of solectron s sales 
turnkey projects  in which solectron procures some or all of the components necessary for production  typically generate higher net sales and higher gross profits with lower gross profit percentages than consignment projects due to the inclusion in solectron s operating results of sales and costs associated with the purchase and sale of components 
during the past few years  solectron has assembled products with varying degrees of material content  which has caused solectron s gross margin to fluctuate 
in addition  the degree of startup costs and inefficiencies associated with new sites and new customer projects has affected solectron s gross margin 
solectron has manufacturing operations in eleven locations  five of which are in the united states  three are in europe  two in malaysia  and one is currently being developed in china 
the us sites include the site in austin  texas  which was purchased from texas instruments incorporated in march for approximately million 
the acquisition resulted in approximately million in goodwill 
on september   the company executed a definitive agreement to acquire force computers inc  a designer and provider of oem platforms for the embedded market 
the transaction is valued at between million and million and will be accounted for using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
the transaction is subject to a number of closing conditions and is expected to close in november as solectron manages its existing operations and expands geographically  it may experience certain inefficiencies due to the management of geographically dispersed operations 
see risks and uncertainties for further discussion of some of the potential fluctuations in operating results associated with the management of growth and geographic expansion  including the pending acquisition of force computers 
results of operations the electronics industry is subject to rapid technological change  product obsolescence  and price competition 
these and other factors affecting the electronics industry  or any of solectron s major customers in particular  could have a material adverse effect on solectron s results of operations

the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of net sales of certain items in the consolidated statements of income 
the financial information and the discussion below should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
years ended august  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development operating income net interest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income net sales over the past several years solectron s net sales have grown significantly  primarily due to an increasing trend toward outsourcing within the electronics industry 
in fiscal  net sales grew to approximately billion  an increase of million  or  over the previous year 
net sales in fiscal were billion  an increase of million  or  over fiscal the sales increase in fiscal was due to increased orders from both new and existing customers at existing sites  the acquisition of the custom manufacturing services cms business from texas instruments incorporated ti in march  the acquisition of the german site in november  and continued growth in solectron s business overall 
the increase in fiscal over fiscal was due to increased orders from existing customers  the addition of new customers  and growth in solectron s turnkey business 
solectron s largest customer during fiscal was hewlett packard company hp 
net sales to hp in fiscal were of consolidated net sales 
net sales to hp in fiscal were less than of consolidated net sales 
solectron s largest customer during fiscal was international business machines corporation ibm with net sales of of consolidated net sales 
net sales to ibm in fiscal were less than of consolidated net sales 
the decrease in sales to ibm  as a percentage of consolidated net sales  reflects both a decrease in actual sales volume to ibm and an overall increase in solectron s total consolidated net sales from all other customers 
the decrease in actual sales volume to ibm is primarily due to the expiration of the manufacturing services agreement with ibm at solectron s bordeaux  france facility which expired on december  solectron has no other significant agreements of this type with any of its customers 
over the last three years  the number of customers which represent more than of consolidated net sales has declined 
during the same period  the percentage of total sales represented by solectron s top ten customers has declined from in and  to in these changes have occurred primarily due to solectron s ability to obtain significant new business from other customers  thereby reducing its dependency on these accounts 
solectron is still dependent upon continued revenues from hp and the rest of its top ten customers and there can be no guarantee that these or any other customers will not increase or decrease as a percentage of consolidated net sales either individually or as a group 
consequently  any material decrease in sales to these or other customers could have a material adverse effect on solectron s results of operations 
net sales at solectron s foreign sites  as a whole  grew at a slower rate over the last year than aggregate net sales at solectron s domestic sites 
foreign locations contributed of consolidated net sales in fiscal  compared to for fiscal the principal reason for the difference in overall sales growth rates between domestic and foreign sites was the acquisition of the cms business from ti  which is almost entirely comprised of domestic sales  and the expiration of the manufacturing services agreement with ibm at solectron s bordeaux  france facility 
sales at the new site in germany partially offset the decline of sales at the bordeaux site 
as a result of solectron s foreign sales and facilities  solectron s operations are subject to risks of doing business abroad 
while to date these dynamics have not had a materially adverse impact on solectron s results of operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be such an impact in the future 
see risks and uncertainties international operations for a further discussion of potential fluctuations in operating results associated with the risks of doing business abroad 
solectron s operations in milpitas  california contributed a substantial portion of solectron s net sales and operating income during fiscal   and the performance of this operation is expected to continue as a significant factor in the overall financial performance of solectron 
any material adverse change to the customer base  product mix  efficiency  or other attributes of this site could have a material adverse effect on solectron s consolidated results of operations 
solectron believes that its ability to continue to achieve growth will depend upon growth in sales to existing customers for their current and future product generations  successful marketing to new customers and future geographic expansion 
customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of delayed  canceled or reduced orders with new business cannot be assured 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any of solectron s current customers will continue to utilize solectron s services 
because of these factors  there can be no assurance that solectron s historical revenue growth rate will continue 
see risks and uncertainties for a discussion of certain factors affecting the management of growth  geographic expansion and potential fluctuations in sales and results of operations 
gross profit gross profit increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal and million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal the gross margin increased to in fiscal  from in fiscal the gross margin was also in fiscal the slight increase in the gross margin in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from manufacturing efficiencies realized at solectron s charlotte  north carolina and milpitas  california sites  increased utilization of the facilities in charlotte  north carolina  and product mix 
offsetting these factors were continued inefficiencies at the scotland site which are partially driven by slower than expected revenue growth 
also  the acquisition of the austin  texas site in march  which currently has a lower gross margin than solectron as a whole  negatively impacted solectron s overall margin 
however  the austin site continues to experience improvements in its margins 
in fiscal  solectron s gross margin was lower than in fiscal primarily due to underutilization of its facility in france and manufacturing inefficiencies at the scotland and north carolina sites 
for the foreseeable future  solectron s gross margin is expected to depend primarily on product mix  production efficiencies  utilization of manufacturing capacity  integration of newly acquired businesses  the percentage of sales derived from turnkey manufacturing  and pricing within the electronics industry 
there can be no assurance that solectron s gross margin will not decrease in future periods 
see risks and uncertainties potential fluctuations in operating results for a discussion of certain factors that may affect solectron s gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased to million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal however  sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales volume remained constant at in fiscal   and  reflecting solectron s intention to continue developing its infrastructure but also to limit its growth in sg a spending relative to its growth in revenue 
the dollar increases in sg a expenses during these periods were primarily due to growth in personnel and related departmental expenses at all locations and continuing investments in information systems 
these expenditures are designed to support the increased size and complexity of solectron s business 
the acquisitions of the sites in germany and texas and to a lesser extent  fine pitch technology  inc  during fiscal as well as the acquisitions of the sites in scotland and washington during fiscal also contributed to the increase in sg a expenses over the past three years presented 
solectron anticipates sg a expenses will increase in absolute amounts in the future as solectron builds the infrastructure necessary to support its current and prospective business 
see risks and uncertainties management of growth  and potential fluctuations in operating results 
research and development expenses research and development activities have been focused primarily on the development of prototype and engineering design capabilities  fine pitch interconnecting technologies which include ball grid array  tape automated bonding  multichip modules  chip on flex  chip on board  and flip chip  high reliability environmental stress test technology  and the implementation of environmentally friendly assembly processes  such as voc free and no clean 
research and development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal net interest expense net interest expense was million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal however  both interest expense and interest income increased significantly during fiscal the increase in interest expense is due to the two debt offerings which occurred in the second and third quarters 
solectron expects interest expense for fiscal to be approximately million 
the increase in interest income is due to the income earned on the remaining undeployed portions of the cash raised from the two debt offerings 
solectron expects to utilize more of the undeployed cash during fiscal in order to fund anticipated future growth 
the decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the voluntary conversion of nearly of solectron s outstanding zero coupon subordinated notes during the fourth quarter of fiscal see risks and uncertainties management of growth  and potential fluctuations in operating results 
income taxes income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  due primarily to increased income before income taxes 
solectron s effective income tax rate remained constant at in fiscal   and the effective income tax rate is largely a function of the balance between income from domestic and foreign operations 
foreign operations for solectron are generally taxed at lower rates than in the united states 
at its penang  malaysia site  solectron currently benefits from a tax holiday that expires in january solectron is seeking to obtain a new tax holiday which  if granted  would last for five years 
if the new tax holiday is not granted  solectron s effective income tax rate would likely increase 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was million at the end of fiscal  compared to million at the end of fiscal in addition to increases in working capital generated from existing sites  the increase over fiscal is largely due to the additional cash and investments on hand as a result of the two debt offerings during fiscal discussed below and an increase in working capital resulting from the acquisition of the sites in germany and texas 
as solectron continues to grow in size it will generally require greater amounts of working capital to support its operations 
during the increase in working capital was financed by cash generated from operations 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  consisting primarily of the cms acquisition from ti for approximately million  million in net investments of monies raised during the debt offerings  and capital expenditures of million primarily for surface mount assembly and test equipment to meet current and expected production levels 
in addition to planned increases in working capital to support anticipated increases in net sales  solectron also expects capital expenditures in fiscal to be in the range of million to million 
beginning in september  solectron will be required to pledge approximately million of cash or marketable securities as collateral for its obligation under the terms of solectron s operating lease for certain of its facilities in milpitas  california 
the lease expires in september solectron intends to re negotiate the terms of the lease before september in addition to solectron s working capital as of august   which includes cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million  solectron also has available a million unsecured domestic revolving credit facility  subject to financial covenants and restrictions  and million in available foreign credit facilities 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the remaining outstanding zero coupon  subordinated notes converted to common stock 
the result of the conversions in the third quarter was a reduction in long term debt of approximately million and an increase in common stock of approximately million 
during fiscal solectron completed two private financings 
the first was for million aggregate principal amount of convertible  subordinated notes due it was completed at the end of the second quarter of fiscal the second offering  completed early in the third quarter of fiscal  was for million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due approximately million of the proceeds from these two offerings collectively the notes was used to complete the cms transaction in march the remainder of the proceeds is being used to finance the working capital for solectron s expected growth 
interest expense on the notes is expected to be approximately million annually and will be offset in part by interest earned on undeployed cash and short term investments 
solectron believes the proceeds from the notes together with the cash generated from operations and solectron s available credit will provide adequate working capital for fiscal risks and uncertainties customer concentration  dependence on the electronics industry during fiscal solectron s sales volume in the personal computer and peripheral segments experienced significant fluctuations 
while solectron s declines in sales revenues in some segments were offset by increases in sales revenues in other market segments  there can be no assurance that sales within any particular market segment will not experience decreases which could have an adverse effect on solectron s sales 
a small number of customers are currently responsible for a significant portion of solectron s net sales 
during the fiscal year ended august   solectron s ten largest customers accounted for over of consolidated net sales  and in the fiscal years and  solectron s ten largest customers accounted for of consolidated net sales 
solectron is dependent upon continued revenues from its top ten customers 
the percentage of solectron s sales to its major customers may fluctuate from period to period 
significant reductions in sales to any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on solectron s results of operations 
solectron has no firm long term volume purchase commitments from its customers  and over the past few years has experienced reduced lead times in customer orders 
in addition  customer contracts can be canceled and volume levels can be changed or delayed 
the timely replacement of canceled  delayed or reduced contracts with new business cannot be assured 
these risks are increased because a majority of solectron s sales are to customers in the electronics industry  which is subject to rapid technological change and product obsolescence 
the factors affecting the electronics industry in general  or any of solectron s major customers in particular  could have a material adverse effect on solectron s results of operations 
management of growth  geographic expansion solectron has experienced substantial growth over the last five fiscal years  with net sales increasing from million in fiscal to billion in fiscal year in recent years  solectron has acquired facilities in six locations  including solectron s most recent purchase of the contract manufacturing services cms business of texas instruments incorporated ti 
there can be no assurance that solectron s historical revenue growth will continue 
there can also be no assurance that solectron will successfully manage the integration of the cms business  or that solectron will successfully manage the integration of the force business  if the merger closes  or any other business it may acquire in the future 
as solectron manages its existing operations and expands geographically  it may experience certain inefficiencies as it integrates new operations and manages geographically dispersed operations 
in addition  solectron s results of operations could be adversely affected if its new facilities do not achieve growth sufficient to offset increased expenditures associated with geographic expansion 
should solectron increase its expenditures in anticipation of a future level of sales which does not materialize  its profitability would be adversely affected 
on occasion  customers may require rapid increases in production which can place an excessive burden on solectron s resources 
cms acquisition from texas instruments incorporated the acquisition of the cms business from ti entails a number of risks  including successfully managing the transition of customers from ti to solectron  transitioning business from kuala lumpur to penang  transitioning employees at the austin site from ti to solectron  integrating purchasing operations and information systems  and managing a larger and more geographically disparate business 
in addition  the cms business will increase solectron s expenses and working capital requirements 
in the event solectron is unsuccessful in integrating the cms business into solectron s business  solectron s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
pending acquisition of force computers inc in september  solectron entered into an agreement to purchase force computers inc  a designer and provider of oem computer platforms for the embedded market 
the proposed acquisition is expected to close in november  subject to various conditions to closing  including termination of the waiting period under applicable antitrust laws and the receipt of necessary third party consents 
the proposed acquisition of force computers entails a number of risks  including successfully managing the integration of the operations  retention of key employees at force computers  and managing an increasingly larger and more geographically disparate business 
in addition  solectron has no significant prior experience in managing and operating a computer platform design business 
there can be no assurance the company will successfully manage this business or obtain the anticipated customer synergy 
in the event that solectron is unsuccessful in managing and integrating the force computers business  the acquisition could require significant additional management attention 
if the company is unsuccessful in integrating and managing the force computers business  solectron s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
international operations during fiscal  foreign locations contributed approximately of consolidated net sales 
as a result of its foreign sales and facilities  solectron s operations are subject to risks of doing business abroad  including but not limited to  fluctuations in the value of currency  tax rates and export duties  changes to import and export regulations including quotas  possible restrictions on the transfer of funds  employee turnover  labor unrest  longer payment cycles  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws and  in certain parts of the world  political instability 
while to date these factors have not had an adverse impact on solectron s results of operations  there can be no assurance that there will not be such an impact in the future 
in addition  at its penang  malaysia site  solectron currently benefits from a tax holiday which expires in january solectron is seeking to have the tax holiday extended 
if the tax holiday is not extended  solectron s effective income tax rate would likely increase 
availability of components a substantial portion of solectron s net sales are derived from turnkey manufacturing in which solectron provides both materials procurement and assembly services 
in turnkey manufacturing  solectron potentially bears the risk of component price increases  which could adversely affect solectron s gross profit margins 
at various times there have been shortages of components in the electronics industry 
if significant shortages of components should occur  solectron may be forced to delay manufacturing and shipments  which could have a material adverse effect on solectron s results of operations 
while the availability of raw materials appears adequate to meet solectron s current revenue projections  component availability to support increased demand beyond solectron s current plans is limited 
furthermore  availability of customer consigned parts and unforeseen shortages of components on the world market are beyond solectron s control and could adversely affect revenue levels and operating efficiencies 
potential fluctuations in operating results solectron s margins and operating results are affected by a number of factors  including product mix  additional costs associated with new projects  price erosion within the electronics industry  capacity utilization  price competition  the degree of automation that can be used in the assembly process  the efficiencies that can be achieved by solectron in managing inventories and fixed assets  the timing of orders from major customers  fluctuations in demand for customer products  the timing of expenditures in anticipation of increased sales  customer product delivery requirements  and increased costs and shortages of components or labor 
solectron s turnkey manufacturing  which typically results in higher net sales and gross profits but lower gross profit margins than consignment assembly and testing services  represents a substantial percentage of net sales 
all of these factors can cause fluctuations in solectron s operating results over time 
because of these factors  there can be no assurance that solectron s margins or results of operations will not fluctuate or decrease in the future 
competition the electronics assembly and manufacturing industry is comprised of a large number of companies  several of which have achieved substantial market share 
solectron also faces competition from current and prospective customers which evaluate solectron s capabilities against the merits of manufacturing products internally 
solectron competes with different companies depending on the type of service or geographic area 
certain of solectron s competitors have broader geographic breadth 
they also may have greater manufacturing  financial  research and development  and marketing resources than solectron 
solectron believes that the primary basis of competition in its targeted markets is manufacturing technology  quality  responsiveness  the provision of value added services  and price 
to be competitive  solectron must provide technologically advanced manufacturing services  high product quality levels  flexible delivery schedules  and reliable delivery of finished products on a timely and price competitive basis 
solectron currently may be at a competitive disadvantage as to price when compared to manufacturers with lower cost structures  particularly with respect to manufacturers with facilities established where labor costs are lower 
intellectual property protection solectron s ability to compete may be affected by its ability to protect its proprietary information 
solectron obtained a limited number of us patents in related to the process and equipment used in its surface mount technology 
solectron believes these patents are valuable 
however  there can be no assurance that these patents will provide meaningful protection for solectron s manufacturing process and equipment innovations 
the company s management believes it has not infringed on any patents  however  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against solectron or its customers in the future 
in the event a third party does assert an infringement claim  solectron may be required to expend significant resources to develop a non infringing manufacturing process or to obtain licenses to the manufacturing process which is the subject of litigation 
there can be no assurance that solectron would be successful in such development or that any such licenses would be available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  such litigation could be lengthy and costly and could have a material adverse effect on solectron s financial condition regardless of the outcome of such litigation 
environmental compliance solectron is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during its manufacturing process 
any failure by solectron to comply with present and future regulations could subject it to future liabilities or the suspension of production 
in addition  such regulations could restrict solectron s ability to expand its facilities or could require solectron to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
dependence on key personnel and skilled employees solectron s continued success depends to a large extent upon the efforts and abilities of key managerial and technical employees 
the loss of services of certain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on solectron 
solectron s business also depends upon its ability to continue to attract and retain senior managers and skilled employees 
failure to do so could adversely affect solectron s operations 
possible volatility of market price of common stock the trading price of the common stock is subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in quarterly operating results  general conditions in the electronics industry  and other factors 
in addition  the stock market is subject to price and volume fluctuations which affect the market price for many high technology companies in particular  and which often are unrelated to operating performance
