item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition overview in  the company initiated a series of significant actions to reposition its businesses for future success 
these initiatives included withdrawal from the department of energy doe support business  restructuring the cost model of continuing operations  improved utilization of working capital  liquidation of non strategic investments and assets  replacing a portion of equity capital with long term debt  adoption of economic value added eva as the basis of measurement and incentive compensation systems and increased investment in internal development programs 
substantial progress was made in each of these areas in and is detailed later in this report 
these programs have resulted in significant changes in financial results in and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
sales increased million in to billion  and operating income increased by over before nonrecurring charges 
total annualized cost savings under the restructuring plan are expected to reach million in key measures of effectiveness of working capital management  days sales outstanding and inventory turns  improved by and  respectively  in research and development and capital expenditures increased by and  respectively 
factors affecting future operating results future trends in revenues and operating income will be dependent on both external factors and on the success of the various programs described above 
in technical services  future performance will continue to be impacted by increased competition  continued funding pressures and changing customer requirements 
future performance in our products segments will be highly dependent on the technological success and market acceptance of our new program initiatives including the amorphous silicon and micromachined sensor projects 
continued success in improving operational efficiency will be required to offset increasing price pressure in most of the company s product offerings 
results of operations the discussion that follows is a summary analysis of the major changes by industry segment 
compared to sales sales from continuing operations of  million for were million  or  higher than sales 
technical services the million increase was the net result of billings under two contracts for communication systems development and water flow control offset by decreases resulting from continuing reductions in government funding and the phase down of the superconducting super collider laboratory contract 
in addition  demand for stationary automotive testing services was lower in the government services businesses are subject to a highly competitive procurement environment  continuing changes in federal budget priorities and rapidly changing customer requirements 
while the impact of these uncertainties on future results cannot be determined  the company continues to see new opportunities for these businesses 
instruments the million increase resulted primarily from higher demand for diagnostic and security products and the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates  partially offset by an million decrease due to the divestiture of three product lines under the restructuring plan 
mechanical components the million increase was due to improving market conditions  primarily for industrial process sealing and aerospace products 
optoelectronics sales increased million  or  primarily due to million of higher sales of ic sensors  acquired at the end of the third quarter of  and higher shipments of flash products 
operating income loss from continuing operations excluding the nonrecurring charges  operating income from continuing operations increased million  or  in the operating loss included nonrecurring charges of million for a goodwill write down and million for restructuring charges 
technical services income was flat  excluding the restructuring charges of million  as the income earned on the two contracts described previously  and an unfavorable contract adjustment and early retirement costs recorded in were offset by several decreases 
these decreases included costs incurred in excess of contract coverage  an estimated provision for a legal judgment  start up costs for the environmental services and systems business and the effect of lower sales levels in certain government services and the automotive testing markets 
instruments the increase of million  excluding the nonrecurring charges of million  resulted from cost reductions of million from the restructuring plan  margin on higher sales and the expense related to the close down of a research and development project 
the increases were partially offset by the unfavorable impact on export shipment margins caused by the strengthening of the finnish markka against other major currencies  the expenses associated with the expansion of the food monitoring business and a provision for additional cost reductions 
mechanical components the million increase  excluding the restructuring charges of million  resulted primarily from margin on higher sales and million of cost reductions 
the results included a provision for environmental remediation costs of million and start up costs for the transportation element of the electromechanical business 
optoelectronics excluding the nonrecurring charges of million  the million net increase resulted from margin on higher sales and million of cost reductions 
the increases were partially offset by lower margins due to competitive pricing pressures and higher production costs in one product line and completion of certain government contracts in the company significantly increased research and development expenses and capital expenditures in to support the amorphous silicon and micromachined sensor programs 
the company anticipates continued increases in research and development expenses and capital expenditures to support product development initiatives in this segment 
general corporate expenses the million decrease  excluding the restructuring charges of million  resulted from million of cost reductions in  and million of separation costs and million of costs associated with the restructuring plan recorded in these decreases in expenses were partially offset by management incentive accruals 
other the million increase in other income was due to gains on sales of investments and operating assets  higher income generated by joint ventures and lower investment write downs 
partially offsetting these factors were higher interest expense and foreign exchange losses 
under the restructuring plan  the net work force reduction in was  bringing the total reductions to positions since the inception of the plan 
the actions taken under the restructuring plan resulted in pre tax savings of million during total annualized cost savings under the plan are expected to reach million in the annualized savings expected for each segment in are as follows instruments million  mechanical components million  optoelectronics million and general corporate expenses million 
the restructuring plan was substantially completed at the end of the effective tax rate for continuing operations was in the effective tax rate of in was higher than normal as a result of the impact of the goodwill write down and the restructuring charges 
in  the company decreased its discount rates for employee benefit plans as a result of the decrease in long term interest rates 
the rates for compensation increases and long term return on assets were also reduced 
the net result of these changes will not materially affect the company s future results of operations 
depreciation change the company changed its method of depreciation for certain classes of plant and equipment purchased after january  from an accelerated method to the straight line method for financial reporting purposes 
the company believes that the straight line method more appropriately reflects the timing of the economic benefits to be received from these assets  consisting mainly of manufacturing equipment 
the company also changed its convention for calculating depreciation expense during the year that an asset is acquired 
previously  the company used the half year convention  starting in  the company commences depreciation in the month the asset is placed in service 
in  the effect of applying these new methods was to reduce depreciation expense by million  and to increase income from continuing operations and net income by million and net income per share by 
the reductions in depreciation expense represent the differences in current year depreciation expense between the old and new methods 
most of this difference occurred in the optoelectronics segment 
depreciation and amortization was higher in than in because the effect of the changes in methods was exceeded by the effect of higher capital expenditures and inclusion of ic sensors depreciation for a full year 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  was million lower in the decrease reflected the expiration of the idaho national engineering laboratory inel contract in september and the rocky flats contract in june future sales and income from discontinued operations will continue to decrease because the nevada test site contracts expired on december  and the mound contract expires on september  sales and income from the mound contract are dependent upon the work scope and fee pools that are negotiated annually  and the expiration date may be modified by the doe in accordance with contract terms 
the mound contract contributed million of sales and million of operating income to discontinued operations in and is the company s one remaining doe management and operations contract 
environmental the company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former company locations and  along with other companies  has been named a potentially responsible party for certain waste disposal sites 
the company accrues for environmental issues in the accounting period that the company s responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated 
as of december   the company had an accrual of million to reflect its estimated liability for environmental remediation 
as assessments and remediation activities progress at each individual site  these liabilities are reviewed to reflect additional information as it becomes available 
there have been no environmental problems to date that have had or are expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
while it is reasonably possible that a material loss exceeding the amounts recorded may have been incurred  the preliminary stages of the investigations make it impossible for the company to reasonably estimate the range of potential exposure 
compared to during the third quarter of  three significant events occurred that had a material effect on both the current financial results and the expected future performance of the company 
first  the company decided not to seek renewal of its four doe management and operations contracts 
second  management completed its review of the remaining operating segments performance and developed a plan to reposition these businesses to attain the company s business goals 
the plan resulted in restructuring charges of million 
finally  the decline in the financial results of certain operating elements within the instruments segment  together with a strategic and operational review of these operations  resulted in an evaluation of the related goodwill for possible impairment 
this evaluation resulted in a million write down of goodwill and a reduction in the estimated remaining useful life of unamortized goodwill from years to years 
the company also wrote off million of a small optoelectronics unit s goodwill 
additional information related to these events is discussed below and in notes  and to the consolidated financial statements 
sales sales from continuing operations for were  million  million higher than sales 
technical services the million decline resulted primarily from the million reduction in program expenditures under the new base operations contract with the national aeronautics and space administration nasa at the kennedy space center ksc 
in addition  automotive testing sales declined million to more normal levels following increases in caused by the introduction of new testing protocols 
partially offsetting these decreases were increased billings of million from the chemical weapons disposal contract as it moves into its testing phase 
instruments the million increase resulted primarily from million of sales of wallac  acquired late in the second quarter of  and a million increase in airport security product sales 
these increases were partially offset by a million sales decrease in other businesses 
these businesses are being sold under the restructuring plan and contributed sales of million in mechanical components the million decrease was primarily due to the absence of sales of an operation divested late in optoelectronics the million increase was due primarily to higher shipments of flash products of million  and million of sales of ic sensors  acquired at the end of the third quarter of partially offsetting the increases were the absence of million of sales from an operation divested late in and a million decrease in sales on a government contract that ended in september operating income loss from continuing operations the operating loss from continuing operations in was million compared to income of million in the loss from continuing operations included the million write down of goodwill and restructuring charges of million resulting from management s restructuring plan 
the wallac and ic sensors acquisitions were the main contributors to the million increase in research and development expenses 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses resulted mainly from wallac and increased corporate expenses  offset by cost reductions in the instruments segment and the absence of expenses of operations divested in restructuring charges during the third quarter of  management completed its review of the operating segments and developed a plan to reposition these businesses to attain the company s business goals 
the plan resulted in pre tax restructuring charges of million 
the principal actions in the restructuring plan included reduction of excess manufacturing capacity  changes in distribution channels  consolidation and re engineering of support infrastructure  disposal of under utilized assets  withdrawal from certain unprofitable product lines  disposal of excess property and general cost reductions 
the restructuring plan will result in the termination of the jobs of approximately  non doe employees  the net work force reduction will be approximately non doe employees 
the major components of the restructuring charges were million of employee separation costs  million of noncash charges to dispose of certain product lines and assets through sale or abandonment and million of charges to terminate lease and other contractual obligations no longer required as a result of the restructuring plan 
the charges do not include additional costs associated with the restructuring plan  such as voluntary early retirement programs  training  consulting  purchases of equipment and relocation of employees and equipment 
these costs were charged to operations or capitalized  as appropriate  when incurred 
the implementation of this plan commenced during the second half of and was substantially completed at the end of technical services the million decrease resulted primarily from reductions in the automotive testing business from the million impact of lower sales and  to a lesser extent  from increased costs 
a reduction at the ksc of million was due to the lower fee on the new base operations contract 
in addition  a million decrease resulted from unfavorable contract adjustments compared to favorable contract settlements 
restructuring charges of million and early retirement costs also contributed to the decrease 
the restructuring plan is not expected to have a significant  direct impact on future results in this segment since cost reductions primarily relate to operations with cost reimbursable contracts 
however  the company does expect to be more competitive in bidding for future procurements as a result of cost reductions 
instruments the instruments loss of million resulted primarily from a goodwill write down of million related to the berthold business acquired in  and restructuring charges of million 
the remainder of the decrease resulted from costs associated with delays in the introduction of new diagnostic products  the impact that the strengthening of the finnish markka had on wallac s results  higher royalty expense and expenses related to the close down of a research and development project 
partially offsetting these decreases were million of cost reductions in the nuclear business 
mechanical components the decrease of million resulted from million of restructuring charges  a provision for environmental remediation costs of million and increased start up costs for the transportation element of the electromechanical business 
optoelectronics profits resulting from higher flash product shipments and the continued benefit of cost reductions implemented in were offset by million of restructuring charges and  to a lesser extent  the impact of lower sales on a government contract 
in addition  the results reflected a million write off of a small unit s goodwill 
general corporate expenses the increase was due to million of restructuring charges  million of consulting costs that were associated with the restructuring plan  million of separation costs incurred during the first six months of the year plus general cost increases 
other the net change in other income expense was due to the write down of certain investments by million to their estimated realizable value due to deterioration in the company partnership s financial condition and the decision to liquidate the company s position in investments no longer consistent with its strategic direction 
the tax provision and effective rate for continuing operations were significantly impacted by the goodwill write down and the restructuring charges 
the company did not record any tax benefit from the goodwill write down and approximately million of the restructuring charges because these charges  while tax deductible  were incurred in tax jurisdictions where the company had existing operating loss carryforwards 
discontinued operations during  the company announced a plan to exit the doe business and decided not to seek renewal of its four doe management and operations contracts although it intends to continue to meet its obligations under the terms and conditions of the present contracts 
the company will not compete for management and operations contracts at other doe facilities 
accordingly  the company is reporting the former doe support segment as discontinued operations for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s contract to manage the inel expired september  and contributed million of sales and million of operating income to discontinued operations in income from discontinued operations  net of income taxes  was million above the level 
the increase resulted from a cost productivity improvement fee of million earned at rocky flats offset partially by the fee reduction reflecting the expiration of the inel contract in september financial condition the company s cash and cash equivalents increased million in while commercial paper borrowings were eliminated and long term debt proceeds were million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the net cash provided by continuing operations was higher in compared to as a result of increased earnings and a million reduction in accounts receivable and inventories  despite higher sales  resulting from the company s aggressive operating capital reduction program 
the decrease in s net cash provided when compared to resulted from lower earnings  partially offset by a net reduction in working capital 
the net cash provided by operating activities was used principally for stock repurchases  capital expenditures  cash dividends and  in and  for acquisitions 
proceeds from issuing common stock in were due to an employee stock purchase plan which was terminated in that year 
cash outlays in under the restructuring plan were million  mainly for employee termination costs  bringing the total spent under the plan to million 
future cash outlays of million primarily represent payments for lease commitments and employee termination benefits being paid over time 
proceeds from dispositions of non strategic assets generated cash in excess of million in discontinued operations generated cash of million in future cash flows from discontinued operations will decrease due to the expiration of all but the mound contract by the end of capital expenditures were million in  an increase of million over the level  and are expected to exceed the level by to in these increases support new product development initiatives primarily in the optoelectronics segment  including the amorphous silicon and micromachined sensor programs 
in  the company issued million of unsecured ten year notes  of a total million authorized  at an interest rate of 
the unissued notes of million are covered by a shelf registration 
the proceeds were used to pay off commercial paper borrowings that were used mainly to finance repurchases of the company s common stock 
the company has two revolving credit agreements totaling million 
these agreements consist of a million  day facility  which expires in march  and a million  three year facility  which expires in march the company did not draw down either of these credit facilities during  and is in the process of negotiating an extension of these agreements 
during  the company purchased million shares of its common stock through periodic purchases on the open market at a cost of million 
as of december   the company had authorization to purchase million additional shares 
the company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and uses them only to protect an underlying exposure 
the company uses forward exchange contracts and options to hedge certain foreign commitments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
the notional amount of outstanding forward exchange contracts was million as of december  the average term is three months  corresponding with expected collections or payments 
on forward contracts  there are no cash requirements until maturity 
credit risk is minimal because the contracts are with very large banks  any market risk is offset by the exposure on the underlying hedged items 
gains and losses on forward contracts are offset against foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying hedged items and  in some cases  are deferred until underlying exposures are recognized if there is a firm commitment 
dividends in january  the board of directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of cents per share  resulting in an annual rate of cents per share for eg g has paid cash dividends  without interruption  for years and continues to retain what management believes to be sufficient earnings to support the funding requirements of its planned growth
