net income of these project mines  however  is not significantly affected by changes in such operating costs  which include costs of operations  interest expense and certain other items 
because of the nature of the contracts at these mines  operating results are best analyzed in terms of income before taxes and net income

the level of customer fuel requirements produced lower demand at coteau and falkirk and higher demand at sabine  resulting in a slight reduction overall in volume at the project mines in the favorable agreed profit per ton variance at the project mines was the result of the annual escalation in the agreed profit per ton as provided for in the long term contracts with each mine s customer 
at the other mining operations  the favorable impact from tonnage volume was primarily caused by increased demand at red river due to the higher fuel requirements of its customer 
increased sales of base tons at red river  which yield a higher price as specified in the supply contract  resulted in a favorable mix variance at the other mining operations 
in addition  red river signed a new agreement with its customer in that extends the contract term to in exchange for lower per ton sales prices  which resulted in the unfavorable price variance at the other mining operations

the continuation of strong orders and vendor parts shortages in caused backlog levels to remain high 
management believes that the nmhg backlog levels are consistent with the overall industry 
outlook the forklift truck industry has historically been cyclical  with industry demand fluctuating with the economic conditions in the various geographic markets in which the industry s customers operate 
based on external economic forecasts and recent factory order levels  management expects demand in north america to level off in from its peak 
in europe  the strong growth experienced in certain markets during may slow somewhat in  but overall the european market should expand
