health care reform health care  as one of the largest industries in the united states  continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
in recent years  an increasing number of legislative proposals have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures that would effect major changes in the health care system  either nationally or at the state level 
among the proposals under consideration are cost controls  insurance market reforms  requirements that all businesses offer health insurance coverage to their employees and the creation of a single government health insurance plan that would cover all citizens 
the costs of certain proposals would be funded in significant part by reductions in payments by governmental programs  including medicare and medicaid  to health care providers 
the company cannot predict whether any of the above proposals or any other proposals will be adopted  and if adopted  no assurance can be given that the implementation of such reforms will not have a material effect on the business of the company 
impact of inflation management does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years
