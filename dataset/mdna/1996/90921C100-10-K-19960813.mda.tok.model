research and development income from operations income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations net income compared to sales from continuing operations for fiscal increased to million from million the prior fiscal year 
this increase in sales is primarily the result of a strong semiconductor equipment market upturn that began during sales of the company s newest model metal seal mfcs grew disproportionately  while sales for older model metal seal product and elastomer mfcs grew at a much more modest rate 
identifiable international sales increased  but the company believes that a significant portion of sales made to domestic original equipment manufacturers are subsequently delivered to foreign semiconductor manufacturers 
cost of sales decreased to of net sales in  compared to in  primarily because of greater manufacturing overhead absorption and higher productivity 
partially offsetting this lower cost of sales percentage for the fiscal year was higher material costs because of product mix and higher costs recorded by the company s offshore manufacturing facilities 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percent of sales to in from in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease is primarily attributable to the increased sales levels and to the closure of the former corporate office in erie  pennsylvania and the relocation of the corporate office function to unit instruments headquarters in yorba linda  california

restructuring charges of  were recorded during the year  as compared to  recorded for fiscal no additional restructuring costs were incurred subsequent to the second quarter and none are anticipated in the immediate future 
research  development and engineering expenses increased for fiscal  but declined marginally as a percent of sales to from in the company decided during the year to lessen its dependency on outside consulting engineers and augment its internal resources 
this resulted in headcount increasing to individuals dedicated to research  development and engineering at the end of fiscal from at the end of the prior fiscal year 
the company believes that the continued timely development of new products and enhancements to existing products is essential to maintaining and increasing its competitive position

million for the prior fiscal year 
this increase is attributable to several factors  including higher sales levels  lower cost of sales  lower restructuring expenses and lower administrative costs resulting from the relocation of the corporate office 
income taxes on continuing operations were provided for at a rate for fiscal  which is significantly higher than the prior rate of 
the fiscal tax rate was favorably impacted by modest pre tax income and certain effects of the restructuring activities 
income from continuing operations advanced to million  or per share  for the current fiscal year from 
million  or per share in the prior fiscal year 
income from discontinued operations resulted from autoclave engineers group s performance through the date of sale in september  a net gain of million was recorded on the sale of autoclave engineers group 
for the prior fiscal year  a net gain of million was recorded on the sale of burton corblin 
net income for fiscal was million  or per share  which compares favorably to fiscal results of million  or per share 
the company s results of operations may be affected in the future by a variety of factors including the dependency of sales on a few large customers  product mix  new product offerings by the company and its competitors  competitive pricing pressures  new technologies  product cost changes and the acquisition of new businesses with different cost and expense structures

restructuring costs of million were incurred during fiscal principally for severance charges related to the company s planned sale of the autoclave engineers group and closure of the erie corporate office 
research and development expenses increased over the prior year and increased as a percent of sales to in fiscal from for fiscal these higher expenses represent additional staffing and increased development activity directed toward product enhancements and new products 
interest income increased to  in compared to  in the increase in interest income was attributable to higher cash balances generated from the sale of burton corblin in which were offset  to a limited extent  by generally lower interest rates

the company estimates that it will spend approximately million on capital expenditures in fiscal in june   the company acquired control systems  inc for a combination of common stock  cash and the assumption of liabilities
