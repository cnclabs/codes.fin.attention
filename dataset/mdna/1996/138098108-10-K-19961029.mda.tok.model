the lack of growth and profitability of consumer products has resulted principally from lower demand for product

the company has two credit facilities  a  revolving credit facility for carsen  and a  revolving credit facility for medivators  which was entered into on may  pursuant to the terms of the carsen revolving credit facility  the borrowing availability is subject to a potential reduction on january  to an amount which will be agreed to by both carsen and the lender and borrowings must be paid in full no later than december  borrowings outstanding at july  and are in canadian dollars and bear interest at 
above the lender s canadian prime rate 
a commitment fee on the unused portion of this facility is payable in arrears at a rate of 
per annum  with interest on borrowings payable monthly 
pursuant to the terms of the medivators revolving credit facility  borrowings must be paid in full no later than december  borrowings bear interest at above the lender s us prime rate 
a commitment fee on the unused portion of this facility is payable in arrears at a rate of 
per annum  with interest on borrowings payable monthly 
each of the credit facilities provide for restrictions on available borrowings based primarily upon percentages of eligible accounts receivable and inventories  require the subsidiary to meet certain financial covenants  are secured by substantially all assets of the subsidiary  and are guaranteed by cantel 
a decrease in the value of the canadian dollar against the united states dollar could adversely affect the company because the company s canadian subsidiary purchases substantially all of its products in united states dollars and sells its products in canadian dollars 
such adverse currency fluctuations could also result in a corresponding adverse change in the united states dollar value of the company s assets that are denominated in canadian dollars 
under the carsen credit facility the company s canadian subsidiary has a  us dollars foreign exchange hedging facility which is available to be used to minimize future adverse currency fluctuations as they relate to purchases of inventories 
the company s canadian subsidiary had foreign exchange forward contracts at october  aggregating  us dollars to hedge against possible declines in the value of the canadian dollar which would otherwise result in higher inventory costs 
such contracts represent the canadian subsidiary s projected purchases of inventories through april  the average exchange rate of the contracts open at october  was canadian dollar per united states dollar  or 
united states dollar per canadian dollar 
the exchange rate published by the wall street journal on october  was canadian dollar per united states dollar  or 
united states dollar per canadian dollar 
the company believes that its anticipated cash flow from operations and the funds available under the revolving credit facilities will be sufficient to satisfy the company s cash operating requirements for the foreseeable future based upon the current level of operations 
at october    was available under the credit facilities 
as of july   the company had net operating loss carryforwards for united states income tax purposes nols of approximately  which will expire through july  of this amount  approximately  represents nols accumulated by medivators prior to the merger  which may only be used against the future earnings of medivators and are subject to annual limitations due to the ownership change 
in addition  the company and its canadian subsidiary cannot file consolidated tax returns  for canadian or united states income tax purposes 
therefore  neither net losses sustained by the company in the united states nor the nols can be utilized to reduce canadian federal or provincial income taxes payable by the canadian subsidiary on its taxable income nor can losses sustained by the canadian subsidiary  if any  be used to offset taxable income earned by the company in the united states 
this has resulted in the payment of income taxes by the company in canada  notwithstanding net losses sustained by the company in the united states 
inflation has not significantly impacted the company s operations
