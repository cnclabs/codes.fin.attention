kevin kilbane  formerly president engineered pump group with ingersoll dresser pump company  rejoined goulds pumps as president goulds pumps europe 
management believes that the company s ability to succeed in the years ahead will be significantly enhanced with the addition of these individuals 

the company continued to develop a regional management structure during this regionalization focused on enhancing the company s presence in the asia pacific region  and also resulted in the formation of a latin american region headquartered in mexico 

in december  the company decided to close its manufacturing activities in venezuela and write off a significant portion of its related investment 
this decision was driven by the operation s lack of profitability over the last several years  compounded by uncertain economic conditions in the country 
the company will continue to maintain a strategic presence in venezuela by operating a pump repair and overhaul pro service center  as well as certain sales offices 

also in december  the company transferred the ownership of its owned subsidiary  environamics corporation  to that company s then current management 
environamics  which had been expected to break even in and  posted a pre tax loss of approximately million in each year  primarily due to a later than expected product introduction in and lower than expected sales in the company anticipated that these lower sales levels would have continued and that significant additional investment would have been required 
this action resulted in a million pre tax charge  or million after taxes

net sales net sales the increase in total net sales of million in compared with is composed of a million increase  or  in water technologies sales while industrial products sales increased million  or 
over the past several years  the company s net sales have reflected an increasing proportion of wt products 
this is evidenced by the fact that the wt sector comprised of total net sales in  compared with in ip sales increased million due to the recently acquired vogel business  which added million in  and higher shipments at the engineered products  canadian  and vertical products business units 
these increased shipments resulted primarily from strong demand in the pulp and paper and chemical markets 
wt sales were at record levels for totaling million  a increase over s sales of million 
sales in the wt sector rose as a result of the vogel acquisition  which accounted for million of the increase  and generally increased sales in europe and north america 
excluding vogel  wt sales in europe rose million primarily as a result of an increased sales presence and new products 
sales of wt products in north america increased million in mainly due to the growing market acceptance of recently introduced products 
in  consolidated net sales of million represented an increase of million  or  compared with ip sales increased million in over led by higher sales activity at the engineered products business unit

ip s gross profit percentage for decreased slightly to from a year ago 
this decrease was the result of competitive pricing pressures and manufacturing issues that temporarily affected throughput and lead times adversely during the year 
wt s gross profit percentage improved slightly to in  compared with for this improvement resulted mainly from margin increases in wt s north american operations  primarily related to a shift in product mix and benefits gained from manufacturing efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in as a percentage of net sales were unchanged from the prior year 
higher sg a expenses at vogel  as well as other european operations  prevented the overall percentage from decreasing 
without vogel  sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales would have been in the costs included a charge of million primarily related to the resignation of the company s former president and chief executive officer 
research and development r d expenses in were million  a decrease of from in  the higher level of r d expenses was related to environamics  where all costs were charged to r d prior to the first product shipments in late restructuring charges in december  the company recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
this charge resulted from the company s decision to transfer its ownership interest in environamics corporation to that company s management and to wind down the manufacturing operation in venezuela  impacting the company s investment in this subsidiary 
the charges associated with these items amounted to million and were offset in part by a million reversal of a portion of the previous year s restructuring charge 
this reversal was due to lower than expected severance costs in california and the netherlands 
environamics was transferred to two senior managers from whom the business had been purchased  resulting in a million pre tax charge 
the decision to dispose of environamics came after losses of approximately million pre tax were recorded in both and the company believed that further losses were likely to occur in  and that substantial additional investment would be required 
net sales for environamics in were million 
the decision to close the manufacturing activities in venezuela resulted in a million pre tax charge in the company had sustained losses in almost every year since  when it took ownership of the operation  including a pre tax loss of million 
these losses  coupled with an uncertain economic climate in venezuela greatly exacerbated by high inflation and a significant devaluation of its local currency  prompted the company to wind down this operation 
once current orders are completed in the first half of  this significantly downsized business unit will operate as a pro service center 
the company will also maintain its presence in the country with certain sales offices 
shipments will continue to be made into venezuela from the company s other manufacturing facilities 
the termination of approximately employees was included in the restructuring charge 
of the total million of restructuring charges related to environamics and venezuela in  million related to other exit costs including the write off of previous investments and million related to termination benefits 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an initial pre tax restructuring charge of million and a related liability for such costs 
the restructuring plan included the downsizing of the company s california  netherlands  and mexican based operations  and the consolidation of sales offices  pro service centers  and other company facilities 
as stated above  million of the restructuring charge was reversed in the fourth quarter of due to lower than expected outsourcing in california and the transfer of certain netherlands employees to other goulds pumps european operations 
the restructuring included the termination of employees 
net of the reversal  the related costs to exit facilities were million and termination benefits were million 
through year end  the company has recorded million in exit costs and million in termination costs against the liability 
the balance in the restructuring reserve at december  was million

earnings from affiliates interest expense interest income other income expense net earnings from affiliates decreased million in from due to the shift in control of oil dynamics  inc odi to franklin electric co

the company s investment  which was reduced to a ownership interest  is now recorded under the cost method of accounting 
prior to this change in control  the company s proportionate share of odi s earnings had been reflected as income 
the company s share of odi s earnings in declined by million due mainly to a substantial decrease in odi s sales to russia that resulted from a lack of financing availability in russia 
interest expense rose million in mainly as a result of bank and capital lease debt assumed or incurred in connection with the vogel acquisition 
in addition  wt europe debt levels increased in order to fund higher working capital needs 
the million increase in interest expense in from was due to higher interest rates and overall higher debt levels 
interest income in decreased million from  while s interest income reflected a million increase over these changes resulted primarily from a short term investment arrangement in which increased interest income in that year by million 
year over year comparisons of other income expense net are affected by a pre tax curtailment gain of million resulting from the revision to the company s non union eligibility requirements for certain employee benefits see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information and a million charge in due to foreign currency transaction losses on short term investment arrangements entered into by wt europe 
excluding these items  other income expense net improved million in over mainly as a result of transaction and translation losses that occurred in resulting from significant devaluations of the venezuelan bolivar 
income taxes effective tax rate in  the effective tax rate decreased significantly as a result of a fourth quarter international tax restructuring strategy and tax benefits associated with the venezuelan restructuring charge 
the low effective tax rate was due to a non recurring cumulative adjustment to deferred taxes associated with tax code changes and the implementation of the corporate european tax restructuring 
return on equity the return on average stockholders equity in decreased to from in and in the decreases in both years are primarily a result of lower net earnings  which were significantly impacted by the restructuring and environmental litigation charges 
excluding restructuring charges  the returns on average stockholders equity were  and in  and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows for  the million of cash generated by operating activities combined with a negative million translation effect were used to fund million of net investing activities and million of financing activities  thus decreasing cash and cash equivalents by million 
a significant increase in trade receivables due to higher shipments near year end had an adverse impact on cash provided by operating activities in capital additions in were million  exceeding depreciation of million 
significant projects included equipment and building additions  primarily at wt europe 
total debt at the end of increased million compared with year end  primarily due to the vogel acquisition and increases at wt europe that were required to finance working capital needs 
debt assumed in connection with the vogel acquisition in december of million was netted in the investment in vogel line in the consolidated balance sheet 
in  the company replaced its million revolving credit agreement  which expired on october   with a million revolving credit agreement expiring october  the company s ongoing emphasis on asset management during resulted in significant improvements in the effective utilization of financial resources when compared with accounts receivable measurements based on the average number of days that sales were outstanding improved in compared with inventory turnover  which measures the effectiveness of efforts to minimize inventory levels  improved in over the company operates internationally  giving rise to exposure to market risks from changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates 
foreign exchange contracts are used to minimize the cash flow effects of unfavorable movements in foreign exchange rates 
derivative financial instruments are also used by the company to reduce those risks 
the company does not hold or issue financial or derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
cumulative translation adjustments on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets at december   were million  compared with million on december   reflecting the weakening of the italian lira and the mexican peso against the us dollar 
orders and backlog in  orders received were a record million  an increase of over the orders level of million 
excluding vogel orders  which amounted to million in  consolidated orders would have been million  an increase of million  or  over ip orders rose without vogel  while wt orders increased  also without vogel 
the ip sector posted solid increases in both pump and repair order activity in  while the industrial core markets remained strong throughout the year 
the company experienced an interruption in orders momentum at the engineered products business unit during the middle of when lead times were temporarily lengthened 
however  most of these lead times were reduced to competitive levels by year end 
within the wt sector  the increase in orders activity was led by the european and asia pacific regions 
backlog levels at december  totaled million  an increase of from without vogel  backlog at year end would have been million  or an increase of over  primarily due to strong fourth quarter order activity at the ip sector 
backlog exists primarily at the ip sector  as the wt sector maintains small backlog levels since its products are normally shipped within two weeks from receipt of a customer order 
inflation generally  increases in material costs have been offset by productivity improvements and sales price increases
