the company s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that may cause such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed under the caption certain factors that may affect future results as well as elsewhere in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and those discussed in the company s other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
the following discussion and analysis is based on the company s financial statements and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere herein 
overview during fiscal  several actions were taken to position the company for the future 
these actions included the acquisition of ptc ii  the formation of the company s alliance with chemgenics  the establishment of a business unit organizational structure  significant reductions in the company s quarterly operating expense run rate  the introduction of several major new instrument and reagent systems and related realignment of the company s product offering  further establishment of the company s presence internationally  the addition of several key members to the senior management team  and the raising of approximately million in net new capital through a private placement of the company s common stock 
through the acquisition of ptc ii  the company acquired important drug discovery  sequencing  synthesis and diagnostic technologies 
the joining of these technologies with the company s core technologies has enhanced the company s ability to establish important strategic alliances 
for example  in the company entered into strategic alliances with chemgenics  see business business development 
and most recently in december  with incyte pharmaceuticals  inc incyte 
the chemgenics transaction combined the company s proprietary chemistry and drug discovery technologies with chemgenics gene technologies and drug discovery expertise  creating a broad set of enabling technologies for transforming genomic information and chemical diversity into therapeutic lead compounds 
the incyte alliance involves the company s genespectrometry technology and the further development of perseptive instruments to assist incyte in the rapid generation of genomic data for incyte s lifeseq database product 
perseptive intends to build upon its experience with development collaborations by seeking additional partnerships for the development of innovative instrument and reagent products that satisfy customer needs and accelerate the drug discovery process 
the company s strategy  in part  is to continue to enhance perseptive s role in the protein characterization marketplace through its purification  analysis and synthesis capabilities and knowledge and to apply this expertise to further address the emerging high growth markets of genomics and drug discovery 
in addition  management intends to work to continue to augment the company s core business activities through additional alliances with leaders in these fields 
operationally  the company made a strategic decision during fiscal to move to a business unit management structure in order to establish more focus and accountability at the product line level 
through this initiative  steps are being taken to rationalize the various product line offerings and cost structures to improve the overall operating performance of the company in the near term 
evidence of the success of this management approach has been demonstrated by the significant operating cost reductions that have been achieved since the acquisition of ptc ii in march expenditures in the areas of research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses have been reduced on a quarterly run rate basis by approximately  declining from a high of million in the second quarter of fiscal to million in the fourth quarter 
significant product introductions were made during the current year in all three product lines 
product introductions in the purification product line included the vision workstation and the biocad e 
the vision workstation is the first chromatography system to offer simultaneous biomolecule purification and analysis in a single instrument through robotics 
the biocad e is an enhanced second generation version of the company s industry leading biocad system 
the primary analysis product line introduction was the voyager de biospectrometry workstation 
this workstation is the first time of flight mass spectrometer to incorporate perseptive s proprietary delayed extraction de technology 
other analysis product line introductions included sequazyme sequencing kits and titerfluor assay kits 
synthesis product line introductions included the pioneer peptide synthesizer  a new high throughput peptide synthesis system  and chemistry and reagents for pnas  a compound for which the company has obtained broad exclusive rights 
see business perseptive s technologies dna and peptide synthesis 
in connection with these product introductions  the company recorded certain charges to cover costs associated with the phase out of previous generation instrumentation and non strategic products that were eliminated during the year 
results of operations years ended september  and product revenue product revenue for fiscal was million compared with million for fiscal  an increase of million or 
total product revenue growth excluding the impact of adverse currency effects was approximately million or 
the principal product revenue growth was in the company s purification and analysis product lines 
from a geographic perspective  fiscal product revenue generated in north america declined by approximately million or from fiscal levels 
this decline was principally attributable to the decline experienced in the synthesis product line 
product revenue generated in europe increased by approximately million or and was primarily attributable to increased product sales in the purification and analysis product lines 
product revenue generated in the pacific rim increased by million or  and was due to growth primarily in the analysis product line 
contract revenue contract revenue for fiscal was million compared with million in fiscal the decrease in contract revenue is attributable to the elimination of contract revenue previously recorded in connection with the company s development efforts on behalf of ptc ii  following the acquisition of ptc ii during the quarter ended march  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in march  the company completed its acquisition of ptc ii  which was organized in to accelerate research and development of the application of perseptive s core technologies to certain commercial opportunities in large life science markets 
following the successful completion of an exchange offer for the  outstanding units of ptc ii  the company acquired  of such units 
the ptc ii shareholders who participated in the exchange offer exchanged their units for  shares of perseptive s common stock  and  new class i warrants to purchase perseptive common stock exercisable until august  at an exercise price per share of 
on march   ptc ii became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
each of the remaining  shares of callable common stock of ptc ii not exchanged in the exchange offer were automatically converted into a right to receive one share of the company s common stock 
the total value of the common stock issued in the exchange offer was approximately million based on the market value of the common stock on march  the company recorded an in process research and development charge of approximately million which represents the value of acquired technologies which have not reached commercialization 
gross profit gross profit from product sales for fiscal excluding other charges was million  or of product sales  as compared with million or of product sales for fiscal the decline in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to an increase in unabsorbed overhead associated with the increase in manufacturing capacity resulting in part from the addition of a new poros manufacturing facility and the new synthesis plant in hamburg  germany 
in addition  unabsorbed overhead associated with the framingham instrumentation facility was higher during fiscal the framingham facility was occupied beginning in march  resulting in the inclusion of only six months of under absorption in fiscal and a full year in fiscal excess capacity currently exists within each of these facilities 
this excess capacity has been put in place to support future growth within the product lines served by the respective facilities 
see notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements

these agreements in general provided for a profit on costs incurred by the company on behalf of ptc ii 
costs included in the cost of contract revenue for fiscal and include specifically allocable research and development expense and an allocation of general and administrative expense as provided for under the agreements 
research and development expense research and development expense for fiscal was million or of product sales  compared to million or of product sales for fiscal the increase in research and development expense as a percent of product sales is attributable to the higher expense levels following the acquisition of ptc ii in march the gross level of quarterly research and development expenditures  which includes research and development expenditures reflected in cost of contract revenue  following the acquisition was approximately million 
various management initiatives were implemented following the acquisition that resulted in the reduction of this quarterly expenditure run rate by approximately million or 
the company entered into one agreement during fiscal to license technology developed through the former ptc ii drug discovery program to chemgenics 
see business business development chemgenics 
although management intends to pursue additional commercialization opportunities and alliances in order to obtain value from the technology acquired from ptc ii  the company continues to evaluate the scope and direction of various programs 
there can be no assurance that funding sources and or third party arrangements will be obtained or established to defray the cost of research and development or that any of these acquired technologies will ultimately be successfully commercialized 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million or of product sales  compared with million or of product sales for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expense both in aggregate dollars and as a percent of product sales is attributable to various factors  including investment in the european infrastructure and sales organization which delivered a significant increase in fiscal product revenues  increased marketing expenditures associated with the introduction of several new products  investment ramp up in domestic sales organization resources  and strategic investments in the general and administration organization to add key members to the senior management team as well as enhance the company s management information system capabilities

elements of the charge recorded in connection with the ptc ii acquisition included a million in process research and development charge and a charge for costs relating to an organizational realignment following the acquisition of approximately million 
the charge also included provisions recorded in connection with ongoing litigation matters totaling million 
the impairment charge recorded in connection with the write off of the goodwill associated with the purchase of the in vitro division of advanced magnetics  inc totaled million 
charges related to other miscellaneous matters totaled million 
amortization declined by approximately  during fiscal from levels in fiscal the principal factor contributing to this decline relates to the write off of the unamortized portion of the ptc ii purchase options as part of the ptc ii acquisition charge 
the increase in interest expense of  is attributable to incremental interest expense associated with a full year of interest cost on capital lease obligations as well as the mortgage obtained to partially fund the construction of the company s new synthesis plant in hamburg  germany 
the company did not record a provision for taxes in either fiscal or fiscal accretion of redeemable preferred stock to its redemption value amounted to million during fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the reduction in the level of accretion is principally associated with the million reduction in the level preferred stock on which accretion is being calculated for the current period 
years ended september  and revenue revenue for fiscal was million compared with million for fiscal  an increase of million or approximately 
revenue from product sales during fiscal totaled million as compared to million for fiscal  reflecting an increase of million or approximately 
approximately million or of the product sales increase is attributable to growth in the company s core business lines of purification and analysis 
the million increase in purification and analysis revenues represents an increase of over fiscal revenues for the same business lines and is attributable to continued growth in all of the company s products contained therein 
the remaining million  or of the increase  is attributable to incremental revenues from the synthesis business for which the predominant source of product revenues is derived from the synthesis products business acquired from millipore in august and included in the company s results since the acquisition date 
from a geographic perspective  fiscal product revenues generated in north america constituted approximately of total product revenues  pacific rim sourced revenue contributed approximately of total product revenues and european sourced revenue comprised approximately of total product revenues 
total international revenues for fiscal were insignificant as a percentage of total revenue 
the company entered into its first significant strategic product distribution alliance with boehringer mannheim gmbh during fiscal under the terms of this agreement  boehringer mannheim will share the co exclusive right  together with perseptive and its agents  to distribute the company s poros chromatography columns on a worldwide basis 
the alliance did not have a significant impact on total fiscal revenues 
contract revenues increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  an increase of million or over fiscal see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the fiscal revenue increase is attributable to a full year of research and development activity performed by the company on behalf of ptc ii versus three quarters of activity completed in fiscal following the formation of ptc ii in december of the research and development activities performed on behalf of ptc ii by the company were funded in total by ptc ii and were related to the pursuit of applications of the company s core technologies in biomedical fields that extend beyond the company s core business 
in conjunction with the formation of ptc ii in december  ptc ii paid the company million to license technology from the company 
included in contract research and license revenue are the and license fees of million and million  respectively  which represent the amortization of the license fee paid by ptc ii to the company for the technology 
prior to the acquisition of ptc ii in march  this fee was being amortized into income over the original expected life of ptc ii at a rate of  per quarter 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
gross profit gross profit from product sales for fiscal was million  or of product sales  as compared with million or of product sales for fiscal fiscal gross profit reflected significant fourth quarter provisions related to charges recorded to provide for estimated inventory obsolescence and warranty obligations 
fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales was negatively impacted by changes in general product mix and pricing  manufacturing overhead absorption variances that were recorded as a fiscal period expense and increased field service expenses 
manufacturing overhead absorption variances for fiscal were attributable in part to management s efforts to reduce inventory levels from fiscal levels resulting in limited production of new units during the current period 
field service costs increased significantly over fiscal  due in part to the incorporation of the synthesis products business 
the level of service revenue generated during fiscal did not offset the level of cost incurred and as a result  the incremental amount of this cost component had a negative impact on fiscal margins 
contract revenue gross margins during fiscal and equal the contractual markup provided for in the governing documents between the company and the respective entities for which the company provides contract research services  after adjusting for license fees included in contract research revenue as discussed above 
these agreements in general provide for a profit on costs incurred by the company on behalf of the respective parties 
costs included in cost of contract revenue for fiscal and include specifically allocable research and development expense and an allocation of general and administrative expense as provided for under the respective agreements 
research and development expense research and development expense for fiscal was million  or of product sales  compared to million or of product sales for fiscal the decrease in research and development expense as a percentage of product revenue is primarily attributable to increased product revenue 
the aggregate level of research and development expense during fiscal reflects the company s continued support of the purification  analysis and synthesis product lines 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or of product sales  compared with million  or of product sales  for fiscal fiscal selling  general and administrative expenditures included significant provisions totaling approximately million recorded during the third and fourth quarters  discussed in further detail below 
the higher level of aggregate spending during fiscal relates to higher levels of staffing for sales  marketing and administrative functions and the inclusion of the such expenses related to fiscal acquisitions for a full year

goodwill amortization increased to million in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in the goodwill amortization charge relates primarily to the amortization of goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of the synthesis products business from millipore offset by the reduction in amortization due to the write off of excess purchase price to purchase research and development in the fourth quarter of in connection with the acquisition of vestec corporation 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the significant increase in interest expense during fiscal is primarily due to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes in august other income expense for fiscal reflected income of approximately  versus expense of  in fiscal the change is primarily due to the reversal of previously recorded unrealized losses of  on the company s investment portfolio which were recorded during fiscal in connection with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no

during fiscal  the company offset its current tax obligations with certain deferred tax benefits residing in corresponding tax jurisdictions 
accretion of redeemable preferred stock to its redemption value amounted to million during fiscal as compared to  for fiscal this accretion charge represents the amortization of the difference between the face value of the preferred stock issued to millipore in connection with the company s august acquisition of the synthesis products business and its estimated fair value at the date of issuance using the interest method 
the increase is due to a full year of accretion in fiscal liquidity and capital resources from inception through the end of fiscal  the company has met its funding needs primarily through private placements of equity and debt securities  public offerings of common stock and to a lesser extent through various other types of borrowing and financing arrangements

management intends to continue its focus on improving relative inventory levels during fiscal and to take aggressive actions to sell slow moving inventories 
during fiscal  the company completed several significant capital projects that were commenced during fiscal  including the synthesis manufacturing facility in hamburg  germany  and the poros manufacturing facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
no significant capital projects are planned for fiscal on august   the company acquired the synthesis product business from millipore corporation millipore 
under the acquisition agreement  the company paid millipore million in cash  assumed certain liabilities of the business and issued millipore  shares of a newly created non voting redeemable convertible preferred stock 
the preferred stock is redeemable in four equal installments on each of the first four anniversaries of the closing of the acquisition in million installments payable at the company s option in cash or common stock

upon consummation of this transaction  the company obtained approximately million in cash and short term investments held by ptc ii as of the effective date 
although management intends to pursue additional commercialization opportunities and alliances in order to obtain value from the technology acquired from ptc ii  the company continues to evaluate the scope and direction of various programs 
there can be no assurance that funding sources and or third party arrangements will be obtained or established to defray the cost of research and development or that any of these acquired technologies will ultimately be successfully commercialized 
in june  the company entered into a transaction with chemgenics in which the company transferred certain assets and employees of the company s drug discovery program to chemgenics and granted a non exclusive license to chemgenics to use the company s technology including technology developed through ptc ii in the field of drug discovery in exchange for shares of chemgenics common stock and warrants to purchase additional shares of chemgenics common stock exercisable until june  the warrants are exercisable at per share per share after a proposed for reverse stock split 
the company is subject to certain contractual restrictions on the sale or distribution of its holdings of chemgenics common stock

on december   chemgenics announced that it had filed a registration statement with the sec for the initial public offering of chemgenics common stock 
the chemgenics transaction was accounted for under the equity method 
the book value of the assets transferred was not significant 
the transaction will combine the company s proprietary technology in the field of drug discovery with chemgenics gene technologies 
the company does not expect to recognize any significant impact from this transaction in its results of operations or cash flows in the near term with the exception of the potential payment of the promissory note described above 
in august  the company completed a private placement under regulation d of the securities act of  as amended  of  shares of common stock at per share

the company believes that its capital resources are sufficient to fund its operations through the end of fiscal the company believes that additional financing will be required for the development of some of its currently planned product introductions and to support the company s future operations and revenue growth 
the company s future working capital and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of the company s research and development of new products  the level of resources that the company devotes to the development of manufacturing and marketing capabilities  the consistency of cash collections  the ability to reduce working capital investment levels  the success of cost containment initiatives  the competitive environment and the growth in the company s business  any of which factors may cause the company s actual future capital resources and needs to differ materially  notwithstanding the forward looking statement in the first sentence of this paragraph 
the company believes that the level of financial resources available to it is an important competitive factor 
the company is actively seeking to raise additional capital through various initiatives  including through an equity or debt financing in the near future and or corporate partnering arrangements 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to successfully raise additional capital at acceptable terms  and any failure to do so could have adverse consequences on planned future product introductions and the company s growth and operations 
in the event that additional financing is not obtained  the company is committed to take actions to significantly reduce its cost structure in the future 
certain factors that may affect future results additional financing requirements 
the company believes additional long term financing will be required for the development of some of its currently planned product introductions and to support its planned operations and capital expenditures in its core business relating to the purification  analysis and synthesis of biomolecules 
the company is actively seeking to raise additional capital through equity or debt financing or to enter into corporate partnering arrangements  however  there can be no assurances that this funding will be made available or that terms acceptable to the company will be reached 
potential fluctuations in operating results 
the company s operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year  depending on factors such as the timing of biopharmaceutical development and commercialization programs of the company s customers  the timing of increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses  the timing and size of orders  the introduction of new products by the company and the capital resources of the company s customers 
the company s current and planned expense levels are based in part on its expectations as to future revenue 
consequently  revenue or profits may vary significantly from quarter to quarter or year to year and revenue or profits in any period will not necessarily be predictive of results in subsequent periods 
uncertainties associated with future performance 
the company expects to continue to improve operating results in future periods  however  there can be no assurance that the company will achieve or maintain profitability or that its revenue growth can be sustained in the future 
the company s success in the market for biopharmaceutical purification  analysis and synthesis products will depend  in part  on attracting and maintaining key employees  continued development of foreign sales operations  successful integration of recent acquisitions  continued support from current customers  development of new customers and successful enforcement of the company s patent rights 
see legal proceedings and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
need to integrate acquisitions 
in recent years  the company has made several acquisitions that have increased the number of the company s employees or the scope of its business  or both 
the company may make additional acquisitions in the future 
the success of these acquisitions will depend on a number of factors  including the ability of the company s management to integrate the administrative  manufacturing and sales operations of the acquired businesses with those of the company  to retain key personnel of the acquired businesses  to reduce costs and to preserve and expand the sales of the products of the acquired businesses 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to successfully operate acquired businesses or that the company will not experience losses as a result of these acquisitions 
with respect to the acquisition of ptc ii  the success of the combined businesses will depend  in part  on the continued availability of funding sources for the research and development projects 
the company has licensed the technology developed through ptc ii to chemgenics for drug discovery purposes 
see business business development chemgenics and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
if other research and development programs formerly funded by ptc ii are continued by the company  they will be required to be funded in total by the company and it will be required to rely on its own resources or seek alternative sources of capital and or collaborative funding 
there is no assurance that sufficient sources of capital and other funding will be available to the company in the near term or long term to fund all the company s current research and development programs and those acquired from ptc ii 
uncertainties associated with expansion of marketing and manufacturing operations 
the company intends to continue expanding its sales and marketing efforts in the united states and other countries 
the company s ability to accomplish this objective is dependent on many factors  including  among others attracting and retaining a significant number of additional sales and marketing professionals  expanding foreign sales operations  and developing distributor relationships in certain markets 
this continued expansion will involve significant additional expense and the risks inherent in integrating new sales and marketing personnel into the company s existing organization 
increasing sales may also require expansion of the company s manufacturing capabilities for the biospectrometry product line  which would require significant capital expenditures and management attention 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to accomplish its sales  marketing and manufacturing objectives 
potential costs associated with patent litigation 
patent litigation is widespread in the biotechnology industry and  in general  it is not possible to predict how any such litigation would affect the company s business 
the company has sued two competitors for infringement of company patents relating to perfusion chromatography 
the defendants in that suit are seeking to have these patents declared invalid and have asserted counterclaims against the company 
the company may incur substantial additional expenses relating to this and other proceedings 
there can be no assurance that the outcome of the litigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
see legal proceedings 
patent and license uncertainties 
proprietary rights relating to the company s products will be protected from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that they are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are maintained in confidence as trade secrets 
there can be no assurance that any pending patent applications filed by the company will result in patents being issued or that any patents now or hereafter owned by the company will afford protection against competitors 
in the absence of patent protection  the company s business may be adversely affected by competitors that independently develop functionally equivalent technology 
the company has established a policy of vigorously enforcing its patent rights 
see legal proceedings and note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
if the company participates in interference or other proceedings under the jurisdiction of the us patent and trademark office  such proceedings could result in substantial costs to the company 
competitors  including those with substantially greater resources than those of the company  may initiate litigation to challenge the validity of the company s patents 
others may use their resources to design comparable products that do not infringe the company s patents 
there may also be pending or issued patents  of which the company is not aware  held by parties not affiliated with the company that relate to the company s products or technology 
the company may need to acquire licenses to  or contest the validity of  any such patents 
it is likely that significant funds would be required to contest the validity of any such patents 
there can be no assurance that any license required under any such patent would be made available on acceptable terms or that the company would prevail in any such contest 
pending governmental investigation 
since november  the sec has been conducting an investigation into certain financial matters of the company 
if  after completion of its investigation  the sec finds that violations of the federal securities laws have occurred  the sec has the authority to order persons to cease and desist from committing or causing such violations and any future violations 
the sec may also seek administrative  civil and criminal fines and penalties and injunctive relief 
the department of justice has the authority in respect of criminal matters 
the company has been cooperating fully with the investigation 
there can be no assurance as to the timeliness of the completion of this investigation or as to the final result thereof  and no assurance can be given that the final result of the investigation will not have a material adverse effect on the company 
see legal proceedings 
intense competition and risk of technological obsolescence 
the company encounters  and expects to continue to encounter  intense competition in the sale of its current and future products 
there can be no assurance that developments by others will not render the company s products or technologies obsolete or non competitive 
many of the company s competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater resources  manufacturing and marketing capabilities  research and development staff and production facilities than those of the company
