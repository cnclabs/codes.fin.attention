accounting standards require that the financial effect of these events be capitalized and amortized over the remaining terms of the leases 
therefore  large differences can arise between cash and accrual results 
as the cost of these items is amortized  the opposite effect will occur causing reported rental income to be less than the cash received by the company 
rental income decreased  or  primarily due to a decrease in non cash revenue recognized at the data general building

the company has entered into an agreement with the advisor to administer the day to day operations of the company 
the agreement was amended on october   as described in note to the accompanying financial statements 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded   and  respectively of advisory fee expense to the advisor in accordance with the advisory agreement 
the company s properties are managed by continental property management co  cpmc  an affiliate of the advisor 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded   and  respectively  of compensation to cpmc in accordance with the property management agreement 
the company s board of directors including all of its independent directors have determined  after review  that the compensation paid to the advisor and to cpmc referenced above  as well as the reimbursements made by the company to the advisor reflected in note to the accompanying financial statements  are fair and reasonable to the company 
liquidity and capital resources the company s principal source of capital for the acquisition and major renovation of properties has been the proceeds from the initial public offering of its stock 
the company s cash flow has been its principal source of capital for minor property improvements  leasing costs and the payment of quarterly distributions 
at december   the company s cash reserves aggregated  including investments in mortgage backed securities 
the company s investment in mortgage backed securities consists of gnma fnma and fmlmc adjustable rate pass through certificates in which payments of principal and interest are guaranteed by gnma  fnma and fmlmc 
however  changes in market interest rates may cause the securities market values to fluctuate  which could result in a gain or loss if the securities are sold before maturity 
on september   the shareholders approved a proposal to convert the company from a finite life real estate investment trust to an infinite life real estate investment trust and related changes to the objectives and policies of the company and in the compensation to the advisor 
as a result of the conversion  the company has broader  growth oriented investment and reinvestment policies than prior to the conversion 
the company is also expected to have greater potential for portfolio growth and diversification due to its ability to acquire additional properties with the proceeds from securities offerings  to issue stock in exchange for properties and to reinvest the net proceeds from the disposition or refinancing of properties subject to reit distribution requirements 
as of december   the company had no formal borrowing arrangements with a bank and has no long term debt 
each of the company s properties is owned free and clear of mortgage indebtedness 
during the periods presented  the company did not enter into any significant investing and financing activities management continues to evaluate other properties for acquisition by the company 
in the foreseeable future  management believes that the company s current sources of capital will continue to be adequate to meet both its operating requirements and the payment of distributions 
the company currently has two leases that provide or more of its total annual revenue as described under item properties 
the tenants are located at the data general building and provide and of the company s annual base rent under leases that expire in and  respectively 
if one of the tenants decided not to renew  or to default on their lease  management would determine whether a reduction in the company s quarterly distribution rate was warranted in light of the company s distribution policy discussed below  then existing leasing market conditions and other factors deemed relevant by the item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued board of directors 
in connection with any lease renewal or new leasing  the company would incur costs for tenant improvements and leasing commissions which would be funded first from operating cash flow and  if necessary  from cash reserves 
net cash flow provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
the decline in cash flow from to is primarily due to consolidation expenses incurred in the increase in cash flow from to primarily reflects free rent that the company provided to new tenants during and leasing commissions paid by the company during these activities are described in greater detail under results of operations above 
funds from operations for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
the primary difference between the periods reflect the changes in net income as discussed under results of operations 
the company believes that funds from operations is helpful in understanding a property portfolio in that such calculation reflects income from operating activities and the properties ability to support general operating expenses and interest expense before the impact of certain activities  such as gains and losses from property sales and changes in the accounts receivable and accounts payable 
however  it does not measure whether income is sufficient to fund all of the company s cash needs including principal amortization  capital improvements and distributions to shareholders 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance  as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts  funds from operations is net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustment for unconsolidated joint ventures 
the company reports funds from operations in accordance with the nareit definition 
for the periods presented  funds from operations represents net income plus depreciation and amortization 
the measure of funds from operations as reported by the company may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies that follow different definitions 
impact of inflation the company s management believes that inflation may have a positive effect on the company s property portfolio  but this effect generally will not be fully realized until such properties are sold or exchanged 
the company s policy of negotiating leases which incorporate operating expense pass through provisions is intended to protect the company against increased operating costs resulting from inflation 
distributions distributions are declared quarterly at the discretion of the board of directors 
the company s present distribution policy is to at least annually evaluate the current distribution rate in light of anticipated tenant turnover over the next two or three years  the estimated level of associated improvements and leasing commissions  planned capital expenditures  any debt service requirements and the company s other working capital requirements 
after balancing these considerations  and considering the company s earnings and cash flow  the level of its liquid reserves and other relevant factors  the company seeks to establish a distribution rate which i provides a stable distribution which is sustainable despite short term fluctuations in property cash flows  ii maximizes the amount of cash flow paid out as distributions consistent with the above listed objective  and iii complies with the internal revenue code requirement that a reit annually pay out as distributions not less than of its taxable income 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during the years ended december   and  the company declared distributions totaling  or 
per share  and  or 
per share  respectively 
because depreciation is a non cash expense  cash flow will typically be greater than earnings from operations and net earnings 
therefore  quarterly distributions will consistently be higher than quarterly earnings
