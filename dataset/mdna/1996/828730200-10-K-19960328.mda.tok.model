the decrease in fee income for and is primarily due to a decrease in the volume of credit card fees  resulting from the increase in national competition 
in  credit card fees decreased 
million from the level 
loan service fees decreased 
million in and 
million in  primarily due to a lower volume of mortgage loans and an increase in mortgage servicing amortization expense 
on the consolidated statements of income  income from the sale of mortgage loans and dealer bank profits is presented net of commissions 
the income recorded in these accounts results from the company s dealer bank operation  as well as fee income associated with the purchase of single family residential loans  the securitization of those loans  and subsequent sale and delivery of those securities against prior commitments 
for  income from these areas totaled million  compared to 
million in and million in the reduction in  as compared to  is primarily attributable to a mortgage marketing loss of million and reduced profits in the dealer bank operation 
the resulting reduced level of operating income for these two operations for can be directly attributed to the negative impact of rising interest rates on the nation s mortgage and securities markets 
the overall reduction in mortgage income for was partially offset by a third quarter sale of a portion of the bank s servicing rights  which resulted in other income of 
million 
during  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards board no 
fas  accounting for mortgage servicing rights 
fas requires that mortgage servicing rights retained for originated mortgage loans that are sold or securitized be capitalized based on the cost of those servicing rights 
the adoption of fas did not have a material affect on the company s financial position or the results of its operation 
non interest expense non interest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment and other expenses necessary for the operation of the company 
management remains committed to controlling the level of non interest expense  through the continued use of expense control measures that have been installed over the past seven years 
the company utilizes an extensive profit planning and reporting system involving all affiliates and their respective functional responsibility centers 
affiliate banks and associated responsibility centers develop detailed monthly and annual profit plans  including manpower and capital expenditure budgets  based on a needs assessment of the business plan for the upcoming year 
these profit plans are subject to extensive initial reviews and monitored by the company and bank management on a monthly basis 
variances from the plan are reviewed in detail monthly and  when required  management takes corrective action intended to ensure financial goals are met 
company management also regularly monitors staffing levels at each affiliate  to ensure productivity and overhead are in line with existing workload requirements

the loan portfolio is diversified by borrower  purpose  industry and  in the case of credit card loans  which are unsecured  by geographic region 
the company seeks to use diversification within the loan portfolio to reduce credit risk  thereby minimizing the adverse impact on the portfolio  if weaknesses develop in either the economy or a particular segment of borrowers 
collateral requirements are based on credit assessments of borrowers and may be used to recover the debt in case of default 
the company uses the allowance for loan losses as a method to value the loan portfolio at its estimated collectible amount 
loans are regularly reviewed  to facilitate the identification and monitoring of deteriorating credits 
consumer loans consist of credit card loans  student loans and other consumer loans 
consumer loans were million at december   or of total loans  compared to million  or of total loans at december  at year end   credit card loans were million  or of total loans  versus million  or of total loans at december  the decrease relates  in part  to increased competition from national credit card companies offering short term incentive rates to new customers

this includes nonaccrual loans and certain loans identified by management 
nonperforming loans are comprised of a nonaccrual loans  b loans which are contractually past due days and c other loans for which terms have been restructured  to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal  because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
the subsidiary banks recognize income principally on the accrual basis of accounting 
when loans are classified as nonaccrual  the accrued interest is charged off  and no further interest is accrued 
loans  excluding credit card loans  are placed on a nonaccrual basis either when there are serious doubts regarding the collectibility of principal or interest  or when payment of interest or principal is days or more past due and either i not fully secured or ii not in the process of collection 
if a loan is determined by management to be uncollectible  the portion of the loan determined to be uncollectible is then charged to the allowance for loan losses 
credit card loans are classified as sub standard when payment of interest or principal is days past due 
litigation accounts are placed on nonaccrual until such time as deemed uncollectible 
credit card loans are charged off when payment of interest or principal exceeds days past due  but are turned over to the credit card recovery department  to be pursued until such time as they are determined  on a case by case basis  to be uncollectible

it is management s practice to review the allowance on a monthly basis to determine whether additional provisions should be made to the allowance after considering the factors noted above 
the bank s senior loan committee  comprised of outside directors  has oversight responsibility for approving commercial and individual loans in excess of  unsecured  and  secured  and monitoring loan delinquencies  the status of non performing assets and the evaluation of allowance for loan losses 
in addition  the committee ratifies and or approves loans made by other banking subsidiaries in excess of of any such bank s equity capital

the responsibilities and approval authorities of this committee are the same as the senior loan committee  as they pertain to agricultural loans 
the company s special services group is responsible for serving all subsidiaries of the company in the audit  loan review  and compliance areas 
in the area of loan review  periodic audits of each subsidiary are scheduled for the purpose of evaluating asset quality  adequacy of loans  and effectiveness of loan administration 
the special services group prepares loan review reports  which identify deficiencies  establish recommendations for improvement  and outline management s proposed action plan for curing the deficiencies 
this report is provided to a corporate audit committee  which includes outside members of the company s board of directors and selected senior affiliate directors 
the audit committee monitors the reported items until the exceptions are cleared 
based on the above quoted procedures  management is of the opinion that the allowance at december   of million is adequate 
while management believes the current allowance is adequate  changing economic conditions and other conditions may require future additions to the allowance 
moreover  the allowance is subject to regulatory examination and determination as to adequacy 
although not presently anticipated  adjustments to the allowance may result from regulatory examinations 
the company allocates the allowance for loan losses according to the amount deemed to be reasonably necessary to provide for the possibility of losses being incurred within the categories of loans set forth in the table below

the company s general policy is to avoid the use of brokered deposits 
long term debt the company s long term debt was million and million at december  and  respectively 
in  the company made a prepayment of million on the outstanding capital notes 
the company s capital notes  due june   of which million were outstanding at december  and million at  are the major component of the company s long term debt 
interest on the capital notes is payable quarterly  and the interest rate is adjusted quarterly to the then prime rate offered by chase manhattan in new york

with an equity to asset ratio of as of december   the company s strong capital position  relative to peer  provides flexibility to finance future growth and maintain the confidence of deposit customers  investors  and banking regulatory agencies 
the federal reserve board s risk based guidelines established a risk adjusted ratio  relating capital to different categories of assets and off balance sheet exposures  such as loan commitments and standby letters of credit 
these guidelines place a strong emphasis on tangible stockholders equity as the core element of the capital base  with appropriate recognition of other components of capital 
at december   the tier capital ratio was  while the company s risk adjusted ratio for total capital  as of december   was  both of which exceed the capital minimums established in the new risk based capital requirements

at december   retained earnings of the company s subsidiaries were approximately million  of which approximately million was available for the payment of dividends to the company without regulatory approval 
in addition to dividends  other sources of liquidity for the company are the sale of equity securities and the borrowing of funds 
banking subsidiaries generally speaking  the company s banking subsidiaries rely upon net inflows of cash from financing activities  supplemented by net inflows of cash from operating activities  to provide cash used in investing activities 
typical of most banking companies  significant financing activities include deposit gathering  use of short term borrowing facilities  such as federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements  and the issuance of long term debt 
the banks primary investing activities include loan originations and purchases of investment securities  offset by loan payoffs and investment maturities 
liquidity represents an institution s ability to provide funds to satisfy demands from depositors and borrowers  by either converting assets into cash or accessing new or existing sources of incremental funds 
a major responsibility of management is to maximize net interest income within prudent liquidity constraints 
internal corporate guidelines have been established to constantly measure liquid assets  as well as relevant ratios concerning earning asset levels and purchased funds 
the management and board of directors of each bank subsidiary monitors these same indicators and makes adjustments as needed 
at year end  each subsidiary bank was within established guidelines  and total corporate liquidity remains strong 
at december   cash and cash equivalents  trading and available for sale securities  and mortgage loans held for sale were of total assets  as compared to at december  interest rate sensitivity management continually reviews the company s exposure to changes in interest rates 
among the factors considered during its evaluations are changes in the mix of earning assets  growth of earning assets  interest rate spreads and repricing periods 
management forecasts and models the impact various interest rate fluctuations would have on net interest income 
one such model measures the interest rate sensitivity gap  which presents  at a particular point in time  the matching of interest rate sensitive assets with interest rate sensitive liabilities 
as shown in the schedule below  the cumulative rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities at six months and one year  was approximately and  respectively 
a financial institution is considered to be liability sensitive  or as having a negative gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a given time period exceeds the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing within that time period 
conversely  an institution is considered to be asset sensitive  or as having a positive gap  when the amount of its interest bearing liabilities maturing and repricing is less than the amount of its interest earning assets also maturing or repricing during the same period 
generally  in a falling interest rate environment  a negative gap should result in an increase in net interest income  and in a rising interest rate environment this negative gap should adversely affect net interest income 
the converse would be true for a positive gap 
the long term effect of rising interest rates would tend to increase net interest income because of the positive gap ratio 
however  the negative gap for the short term would cause a decrease in net interest income  as a result of rising rates for approximately six months 
since conditions change on a daily basis  these theoretical conclusions may not be indicative of actual future results
