the principal applications for the registrant s products are in the automated horse racing and on line government sponsored lottery industries 
the registrant has also entered into long term service contracts under which it intends to operate on line lottery systems 
the registrant utilizes its technology in other ticket processing applications  such as keno gaming and automated ticket printer readers for toll turnpike systems 
the principal proprietary component of the registrant s systems is the datamark r terminal  a compact  reliable microprocessor based ticketing terminal  which can print and process up to approximately tickets per minute 
the registrant sells the datamark r terminal separately or as part of turnkey wagering application system and can modify the terminal s features or configurations and central system software to meet specific customer requirements 
the registrant s wagering application systems include datamark r terminals  a central computer installation  communication network and display equipment 
system features include real time central processing of data received from multiple locations  back up hardware capability and complete communications redundancy designed to provide fault tolerant operation 
datamark r terminals the registrant has developed several models of datamark r terminals for different wagering applications 
all are microprocessor based and have a compact  lightweight design for countertop operation 
the more recent models use the flipper concept and are approximately deep  wide  high  weigh approximately pounds  and are accompanied by a detached keyboard that may be positioned to suit the convenience of the operator 
other models are slightly larger and may have built in or external displays or keyboards 
the latest datamark r models utilize a compact ticket path which allows the terminal to print on one side and read from both sides of the same ticket 
the terminal contains a thermal printer which prints tickets quickly and quietly without ink  ribbons or impact  thereby improving print quality and reliability  and reducing maintenance expenses 
the terminals use either pre cut thermal coated tickets or thermal coated roll stock tickets or both 
some models will sequentially process up to tickets entered at one time 
the basic functions of the datamark r terminal are similar in all its wagering system applications 
initially  wagering or other selection data is entered into the terminal either manually by the operator via a keyboard  or by a ticket marked by the customer 
the terminal transmits that information to the central computer  where a serial number is assigned to the transaction and a response is sent back to the terminal which then thermally prints the data either on the back of the customer marked ticket or on a new ticket 
after the data has been printed on the ticket  in both numerical and machine readable bar code form  but before the ticket is delivered to the customer  the terminal reads the bar code in order to verify that it is correct and readable when later presented to any terminal for cashing or validation 
when a ticket is cashed or presented for validation  the terminal optically reads the bar code and accesses the central computer to verify that payment is to be made with respect to the ticket 
the central computer calculates the payout amount  transmits this data to the terminal and records the fact that the ticket has been paid  ensuring that tickets are not paid twice 
the terminal prints the payout amount on the ticket giving visual evidence that the ticket has been paid  and directs the ticket to the operator 
the datamark r terminal s basic functions are supplemented by various features 
in the horse racing industry  the datamark r terminal is capable of issuing tickets for pool or for any feature pool currently being used in horse racing 
the terminals are designed to facilitate multiple bets on one ticket and multiple selections for each bet 
in addition  the bettor is able to mark bets on a pre printed playslip  which is then read optically by the terminal  the amount wagered calculated and the bet details printed on the back of the same ticket 
because the ticket is prepared away from the pari mutuel clerk s window  betting transaction time is reduced  efficiency of the operation is improved and the bettor obtains more privacy in the betting transaction 
similarly  in the lottery industry  a player marks the numbers selected on a pre printed ticket or playslip which is read optically by the datamark r terminal and entered into the central system 
the selections and the transaction total are then either printed on the back of the playslip or on a separate ticket and delivered to the player 
wagering and other terminal products the registrant historically has derived revenue in the horse racing industry from sales contracts for datamark r terminals and for wagering systems  which include datamark r terminals  a central computer installation and peripheral and display equipment 
the registrant s systems are sell pay systems  which means that each terminal is capable of being used both for selling all types of wagering tickets and for making payment to the ticket holders after validation of winning tickets 
the nucleus of each wagering system is the central computer installation that receives information from ticket issuing terminals  accumulates wagering data  calculates odds and payouts  distributes information to the display systems and terminals  and generates management information reports 
in cooperation with the customer  the registrant designs the configuration of the central computer installation to provide fault tolerant operation  high throughput and security 
each central computer installation typically includes a computer configuration and various peripheral devices  such as magnetic storage devices  management terminals and hardcopy printers  all of which are manufactured by others 
although certain of the registrant s customers presently use software in their pari mutuel systems which is proprietary to the registrant  the software presently being offered by the registrant in its horse racing system is software  as enhanced and modified by the registrant  acquired by license from the royal hong kong jockey club the rhkjc 
in addition to sales of terminals and systems  the registrant realizes ongoing revenue from the sale of spare parts for use in the maintenance of its terminals of which approximately  have been delivered to date 
the registrant also enters into contracts with its customers to provide software modifications  upgrades and support for its installed products 
lottery systems sales and service agreements computerized  or on line  lotteries are currently operated in many countries 
existing lottery systems include both manual systems and modern on line systems 
in an on line lottery system  betting terminals are connected to a central computer installation by a communications network and the system typically utilizes a pari mutuel pool or fixed payout or both in offering lotto and other numbers games 
prior to  the registrant entered into contracts to provide lottery equipment and management of on line lottery systems on a long term basis in papua new guinea  the republic of georgia  the dominican republic and the russian federation 
in  the registrant recorded million in write offs and a write down against all of these service projects  except russia 
in january  registrant discontinued its operation in the dominican republic 
in july  ilts sold its facilities management and equipment lease contracts for the lottery in papua new guinea to the principal shareholders of the operating company  the lotto pty 
ltd lotto pty 
ilts is being paid in cash installments over a month period plus a percentage of lotto pty 
s sales over the next five years 
proceeds of the sale are anticipated to accelerate the registrant s return on its investment  and to ultimately provide a greater return than if the registrant had continued to operate the lottery for lotto pty 
on november   the russian government issued a decree which required all existing lottery license holders  including the charitable foundation with which the registrant had a management and supply agreement  to apply for re registration of their license by february  due to the uncertainty regarding the license registration and with the continued economic  legal  and political instability in russia  the registrant recorded a provision of million in its quarter ended december  the registrant terminated the russian lottery project in november  after exhausting numerous options to secure outside financing or joint venture partners for the project 
in june  the registrant announced a ten year service and supply agreement with pascal company pascal of the united kingdom 
the registrant will provide a lottery system and services to pascal for operation of an on line lottery on behalf of the national hospital trust nht in england and provided  datamark r on line terminals and associated software  a central computer system and software  training  support  installation and maintenance 
the registrant will be compensated as a percentage of gross weekly lottery sales 
due primarily to a change in ownership of pascal and a corporate reorganization of its new corporate owners no production order for the terminals has been placed pursuant to the supply agreement 
the registrant owns non exclusive rights to use the central system software developed by the rhkjc for use in its pari mutuel wagering and lottery systems 
under the terms of the amended license  the registrant pays the rhkjc a royalty equal to a percentage of the revenue it receives in connection with a sale  lease or providing a service of any lottery system using this software 
in addition  the registrant is obligated to provide the rhkjc with any modifications which the registrant makes to the software  except where ownership to such modifications vests in the registrant s customers 
the registrant has made significant modifications to the rhkjc software  including changes to the system s communications network and changes which permit the generation of more detailed management reports 
in the registrant s lottery system  tickets are processed on datamark r terminals which are connected to a central computer installation  usually by telephone lines 
the central computer installation utilizes digital equipment corporation hardware 
the system has the following characteristics rapid processing  storage and retrieval of transaction data in high volumes and in multiple applications  the ability to down line load  ie  to reprogram the wagering terminals from the central computer installation via the communications network  a high degree of security and redundancy to guard against unauthorized access and tampering and to ensure fault tolerant operation without data loss  and  a comprehensive management information and control system 
revenue sources the following table sets forth the revenue for the periods indicated attributable to different applications of the registrant s technology years ended december  dollars in thousands racing products and services      lottery products and services      other total      product development the registrant s ability to compete successfully depends in part upon its ability to meet the current and anticipated needs of its customers 
to that end  the registrant devotes a significant portion of its research and development activity to refining and enhancing the features of existing products  systems and software 
in  the registrant spent approximately million on engineering  research and development  as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
in recent years  the registrant introduced a new lottery terminal utilizing an advanced version of a charge coupled device ccd reader capable of reading hand written information such as signatures and addresses  as well as other graphics on customer marked tickets 
charge coupled device ccd technology is a requirement for certain european lotteries 
in addition  the registrant developed the single roller flipper terminal with a unique reader printer mechanism that meets the needs of many different applications by combining into one unit all of the functional capabilities of previous datamark r reader printer mechanisms in a modular fashion 
in late  the registrant successfully completed the iso audit performed by underwriters laboratories and in february  was granted iso registration 
this demonstrates quality in design development and manufacture under iso standards 
backlog the backlog of orders for its products and services believed by the registrant to be firm  amounted to approximately million as of december   as compared to a backlog of approximately million as of december  of such backlog at december   approximately million is expected to be filled during see business dependence upon a few customers 
marketing and business development management believes that the registrant s continuing ability to obtain and retain contracts for its wagering systems and terminals is directly related to its reputation in its various fields of expertise 
because of its reputation  the registrant often receives unsolicited inquiries from potential customers 
the registrant also learns of new business opportunities through the close contacts which its personnel maintain with key officials in the international horse racing and lottery industries 
contracts to provide products to the horse racing and lottery industries often are awarded through a competitive bidding process which can begin years before a contract is awarded and involves substantial expenditures by the registrant 
through its contacts with existing customers and others in these industries  the registrant often becomes aware of prospective projects before the customer circulates a request for proposal 
if the registrant is interested in the project it typically submits a proposal  either before or after the customer circulates a formal request for proposal  outlining the products it would provide and the services it would perform 
if the proposal is accepted  the registrant and its customer will negotiate and enter into a contract on agreed terms 
the registrant s marketing efforts are carried out by the registrant s professional marketing and engineering staff and frequently involves other executive officers of the registrant 
marketing of the registrant s products and services throughout the world is often performed in conjunction with consultants with whom the registrant contracts  from time to time  for representation in specific market areas 
the registrant s success depends in large part on its ability to obtain new contracts to replace its existing contracts 
the registrant currently has proposals outstanding to supply systems  terminals or components for use in the pari mutuel wagering industry and for lotteries in various foreign countries 
in  the registrant unsuccessfully bid on one service operating contract for a us state lottery and it intends to continue this marketing effort in and future years 
in addition  the registrant has had discussions with both new and existing customers regarding supplying products for their operations and expects to bid for additional contracts in the future 
because the realization of revenue from these prospects is dependent upon a number of factors  including the bidding process and product development  there can be no assurance that the registrant will be successful in realizing revenue from any of these activities 
late in  prototype deliveries began on the million contract announced in with the revenue markets  inc trimi which is automating the new york state thruway toll road system 
these units are currently being operated in a pilot test mode 
natural avenue sdn  bhd of malaysia  a new customer of the registrant placed a million order for datamark r lottery terminals and a computer operations system 
natural avenue operates an on line lottery in the state of sarawak  in eastern malaysia  which began in february manufacturing and materials manufacture of the registrant s systems and terminals is performed at its facilities in carlsbad  california  and consists principally of the assembly of parts  components and subassemblies most of which are designed by the registrant into finished products 
the registrant purchases many parts  components and subassemblies some of which are designed by the registrant necessary for its terminals and the systems manufactured by the registrant from outside sources and assembles them into finished products 
these products and purchased computers are then integrated with standard peripherals purchased by the registrant to construct racing and lottery systems 
the registrant generally has multiple sources for the various items purchased from vendors  but some of these items are state of the art and could  from time to time  be in short supply 
certain other items are available only from a single supplier 
for the twelve months ended december  no vendor accounted for or more of the registrant s raw material purchases 
competition the registrant competes primarily in the horse racing industry and the on line lottery industry 
the registrant competes by providing high quality wagering systems and terminals that are reliable  secure and fast 
in addition  management believes that the registrant offers its customers more flexibility in design and custom options than do most of its competitors 
management believes that the registrant s main competitors in the sale of horse racing systems and on line lottery systems in the domestic and international marketplace are awa limited  an australian company  essnet  a swedish company  international des jeux  the french national lottery company  gtech holdings corporation  autotote limited and video lottery technologies  all united states companies 
management believes that the registrant s sales of its products in the past five years have been a substantial factor in the international marketplace 
the registrant s sales or leases in the united states have been insignificant 
in general  the registrant s competitors have significantly greater resources than the registrant

none of the registrant s employees is represented by a union  and the registrant believes its relations with its employees are good 
patents  trademarks and licenses the registrant has filed five patent applications on its products  all of which have been issued by the us patent office 
the registrant believes that its technical expertise  trade secrets and the creative skills of its personnel are of substantially greater importance to the success of the registrant than the benefits of patent protection 
the registrant typically requires customers  employees  licensees  subcontractors and joint venturers who have access to proprietary information concerning the registrant s products to sign nondisclosure agreements  and the registrant relies on such agreements  other security measures and trade secret law to protect such proprietary information 
central system software used in the registrant s lottery system has been obtained under a non exclusive license with the rhkjc 
regulation the countries in which the registrant markets its products generally have regulations governing horse racing or lottery operations  and the appropriate governing body could restrict or eliminate these operations in these countries 
any such action could have a material adverse effect on the registrant 
foreign countries also often impose restrictions on corporations seeking to do business within their borders  including foreign exchange controls and requirements for domestic manufacturing content 
in addition  laws and legal procedures in these countries may differ from those generally existing in the united states and conducting business in these countries may involve additional risk for the registrant in protecting its business and assets  including proprietary information 
changes in foreign business restrictions or laws could have a significant impact on the registrant s operations 
dependence upon a few customers the registrant s business to date has been dependent on major contracts and the loss of one or failure to replace completed contracts with new contracts would have a materially adverse effect on the registrant s business
