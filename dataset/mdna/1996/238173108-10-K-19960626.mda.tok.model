management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview datron systems incorporated and its wholly owned subsidiaries the company provide products and services that address the needs of emerging radio and satellite communication markets 
it reports operations in two business segments communication products and services  and antenna and imaging systems 
the communication products and services business segment designs  manufactures and distributes high frequency and very high frequency radios and accessories for worldwide military and civilian purposes 
fiscal sales for this segment were  a increase from fiscal sales of  foreign customers accounted for of fiscal sales and of fiscal sales 
during fiscal  this segment sold radio products to an asian customer that accounted for of this segment s sales and of consolidated sales 
during fiscal  sales of radio products to an african customer accounted for of this segment s sales and of consolidated sales 
the antenna and imaging systems business segment designs and manufactures specialized satellite communication systems  subsystems and antennas that are sold worldwide to commercial and governmental customers  including the us department of defense dod 
fiscal sales for this segment were  a decrease from fiscal sales of  the dod accounted for of this segment s fiscal sales and of this segment s fiscal sales 
because of the decline in us defense spending  the company has been pursuing new markets for this segment s products 
remote sensing satellite earth stations has been the primary such market 
sales of remote sensing products represented and of this segment s sales in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  this segment introduced the dbs tm  a mobile satellite television reception system for recreational vehicles and long haul trucks 
this system is the company s first consumer product 
consolidated sales for fiscal were  a decrease from fiscal consolidated sales of  the decrease in sales was primarily due to lower sales of dod products and remote sensing systems 
a net loss of  or per share  was incurred in fiscal compared with net income of  or per share in fiscal the lower sales of remote sensing systems had a significant negative impact on fiscal financial results because the company had anticipated that increased sales of those products would replace the expected decline in sales of dod products 
those lower than expected sales  costs associated with cancellation of an million order for a remote sensing system  restructuring charges and product development expenses related to the company s new mobile satellite television reception systems were primarily responsible for the net loss 
in march  the company announced its plan to consolidate its image processing division in san jose  california with its remote sensing earth station business in simi valley  california 
both of those functions are part of the antenna and imaging systems business segment 
consolidation of those functions is expected to provide a more integrated solution to the needs of customers and to reduce future operating costs 
in connection with the consolidation  the company recorded a restructuring charge of   or per share  after taxes 
major categories of costs and expenses included in the restructuring charge were estimated employee severance   goodwill write off   and estimated future losses on facility lease   this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially 
reference is hereby made to the statement of investment considerations contained in part i  item of the company s form k  which is available from the company upon request 
the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto that appear on pages through should be read in conjunction with the following review 
results of operations operating results for the last three fiscal years are presented for each of the company s two business segments in thousands communication products and services years ended march  net sales    percent of consolidated net sales gross profit    operating expenses before corporate expenses and restructuring    operating income    percent of consolidated operating income before corporate expenses and restructuring sales of communication products and services increased  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal sales 
the increase was due to higher sales of standard radio products 
sales of radio products to an asian customer accounted for  or  of this segment s fiscal sales 
sales of communication products and services decreased  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal sales 
the decrease was primarily the result of not completely replacing an million sale in fiscal to a european customer 
one customer will often account for a large percentage of this segment s annual sales  however  it is unusual to have large sales from the same customer in successive years 
gross margin on communication products and services sales was in fiscal compared with in fiscal and in fiscal the decline in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to a less favorable mix of products and services and to higher materials costs 
the decline in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to poor margins associated with a new radio telephone product 
sales of that product have been discontinued 
operating income for communication products and services was of sales in fiscal compared with of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal the decrease in fiscal compared with fiscal was due to lower gross margins  higher international selling expenses  higher new product development expenses and higher administrative expenses related to the company s decision not to continue pursuit of the satellite paging business 
the decrease in fiscal compared with fiscal resulted primarily from higher selling expenses related to initial sales of new communication systems and services and to lower gross margins 
because an operating loss was incurred in the antenna and imaging systems business segment in fiscal  of consolidated operating income before corporate expenses and restructuring was attributed to the communication products and services business segment in fiscal antenna and imaging systems years ended march  net sales    percent of consolidated net sales gross profit    operating expenses before corporate expenses and restructuring    operating loss income    percent of consolidated operating income before corporate expenses and restructuring the business of the antenna and imaging systems segment was adversely affected in fiscal by the cancellation of a major order 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company learned that its customer for an million remote sensing satellite rss image processing facility intended for installation in the middle east was not able to obtain funding for the order 
the company had booked and announced this order in july and commenced work on it shortly thereafter 
the company s customer  who was acting as prime contractor for a larger project that included the rss facility  was not able to obtain funding from its customer for the image processing facility 
because the order was conditioned upon funding  and after an extensive assessment of its likelihood of being funded  the company canceled the order in january for lack of payment 
the company concluded  because the rss order was conditioned upon funding that had not been obtained  that its financial statements for the second quarter ended september  required restatement to remove from net sales for the quarter  attributable to the order and originally included in net sales using the percentage completion method of accounting 
the canceled rss order also had a significant impact on financial results for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  and was a major factor in the company s decision to consolidate its image processing division with its remote sensing earth station business  which led to the  restructuring charge described above 
sales of antenna and imaging systems decreased  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal sales 
lower sales of dod products and remote sensing systems were responsible for most of the decrease 
because of the expected decline in defense business  this segment has been pursuing new markets for its products 
in fiscal  sales of remote sensing systems were expected to replace declining dod sales 
because of the canceled rss order and because the awards of several other such systems have been delayed  sales of remote sensing systems failed to replace the declining dod sales 
it is uncertain whether those delayed orders will be awarded and whether the company will receive them if they are awarded 
sales of antenna and imaging systems increased  or  in fiscal compared with fiscal sales 
remote sensing satellite earth stations and image processing systems were responsible for most of the sales increase 
approximately half of this growth was due to sales resulting from the company s acquisition of international imaging systems is in august gross margin on antenna and imaging systems sales was in fiscal compared with in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was primarily due to higher expenses associated with sales of remote sensing systems and to the write off of non recoverable costs associated with the canceled rss order 
the increase in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to lower overhead expenses  partially offset by higher materials costs resulting from changes in product mix 
antenna and imaging systems incurred an operating loss before provision for the restructuring of of sales in fiscal compared with operating income of of sales in fiscal and of sales in fiscal the loss in fiscal was primarily due to lower gross margins  higher new product development expenses and higher selling expenses resulting from the first full year of consolidation with is since its acquisition 
the increase in fiscal compared with fiscal resulted primarily from higher gross margins and from lower performance based bonuses 
consolidated expenses were as follows selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal fiscal sg a expenses increased over fiscal sg a expenses due to higher international selling expenses in both business segments  partially offset by lower administrative expenses 
fiscal sg a expenses increased over fiscal sg a expenses as higher expenses resulting from the acquisition of is and from more extensive international marketing efforts were partially offset by lower administrative expenses resulting from lower performance based bonuses and from the absence of corporate office relocation expenses incurred in fiscal research and development r d expenses were  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal fiscal r d expenses increased over fiscal r d expenses due to acceleration of development programs for direct broadcast satellite dbs television reception systems for recreational vehicles  long haul trucks and commercial aviation  and also due to development of image processing capabilities for the remote sensing agricultural services market 
the company has identified the dbs television market for the mobile user as a potential major new market for its products 
the company believes that most of the development work necessary to enter the dbs market has been completed  and although new products and enhancements to existing products are planned  r d expenditures are expected to decline in fiscal fiscal r d expenses increased over fiscal r d expenses due to further development of the company s remote sensing earth stations and image processing systems  to development of a new handheld encrypted frequency hopping radio and to initial development of dbs television reception systems 
interest expense in fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal  an increase of 
the increase was due to higher levels of term debt during fiscal interest expense in fiscal was  compared with  in fiscal  a decrease of 
the reduction was due to significantly lower levels of term debt during fiscal compared with fiscal and to the termination of the company s interest rate swap in the first quarter of fiscal in april  the company entered into a ten year interest rate swap to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its revolving line of credit 
because the company had no outstanding borrowings against its line of credit at the end of fiscal  the swap was no longer considered to be a hedge 
consequently  it was marked to market  resulting in a loss of  in fiscal the swap agreement was terminated in june with no additional significant effect on operations 
in fiscal  the company recorded other income of  consisting of the following components income loss pre tax after tax per share favorable litigation settlement   loss on interest rate swap   gain on sale of product line   total   the effective income tax benefit provision rates for fiscal years  and were  and  respectively 
the higher rate of benefit for fiscal compared with the provision rate for fiscal was primarily due to the new california investment tax credit 
the provision rate for fiscal was higher than the provision rate for fiscal primarily due to lower tax benefits related to the company s foreign sales corporation earnings in fiscal compared with fiscal order backlog at march communication products and services   antenna and imaging systems   total   the decrease in communication products and services backlog at march  compared with the prior year was due to low order bookings in the fourth quarter ended march  although recent order bookings have been low  it is common for order bookings in that business segment to vary widely from quarter to quarter 
the decrease in antenna and imaging systems backlog at march  was primarily due to lower bookings of remote sensing systems and to a continued decline in dod business 
not included in the order backlog figure at march  are million of contingent orders from distributors for dbs television reception systems that are subject to cancellation without recourse 
liquidity and capital resources at march   working capital was  compared with  at march   an increase of  or 
significant changes affecting working capital during fiscal were the following inventories increased  primarily to meet production requirements for anticipated radio orders and for the new dbs television reception system products  accounts receivable decreased  primarily due to lower fourth quarter sales in fiscal  income taxes payable decreased  due to final settlement of an irs audit and due to the operating loss incurred in fiscal  and other current assets increased  due to an income tax receivable resulting from overpayment of estimated taxes and from the company s net operating loss carry back 
the company s cash position at march  was  compared with  at march   a decrease of 
at march   the company had borrowed  in term debt from its bank to meet operating cash requirements 
the company had no long term debt at march  capital expenditures were  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal capital expenditures in fiscal are expected to be lower than they were in fiscal at march   the company had a  revolving line of credit with its bank that contains an  credit limit for the issuance of letters of credit and an  credit limit for direct working capital advances 
in may  the company amended its revolving line of credit with its bank 
the amended agreement provides a committed revolving line of credit in the amount of  of which up to  may be used for the issuance of letters of credit and up to  may be used for direct working capital advances provided that total credit extended does not exceed  the company believes that its existing working capital  anticipated future cash flows from operations and available credit with its bank are sufficient to finance its presently planned capital and working capital requirements 
the company has never paid a cash dividend on its common stock and does not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
inflation and changing prices have not had a significant impact on the company s historical operations
