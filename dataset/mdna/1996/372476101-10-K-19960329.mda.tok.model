item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company conducts business through two primary segments oil and gas exploration and production  and leonardite mining and processing wherein the company s major products are oil and gas drilling mud additives 
each of the company s segments is discussed herein 
results of operations comparison of to revenue and gross margin oil and gas sales were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase in revenue resulted from an increase in average oil prices combined with a increase in the volume of oil and gas sold 
the average oil price was compared to an average of in the volume of oil and gas sold in increased to  boe barrel of oil equivalent from  boe in the higher production volumes resulted from production contributed by the company s oscar fossum h horizontal well 
net that was drilled and completed in the first quarter of the company also drilled a second horizontal well  the oscar fossum h  during  but that well did not begin producing until mid december  and therefore  did not have a significant impact on oil production 
management expects production from the h well will increase oil production in oil and gas production costs were  in compared to  in  a decline of 
costs were lower because the company performed less workovers during when its operations and cash flow were focused on horizontal drilling 
production costs on a per equivalent barrel basis averaged in compared to for per barrel costs were lower due to the contribution of lower cost horizontal well flush production from the oscar fossum h well 
gross margin for oil and gas operations before depletion and selling  general and administrative sg a expenses was  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue for the increase in gross margin was due to the increased average oil price and production volumes previously discussed 
leonardite sales were  in compared to  in  a decline of 
this decline was due to an decrease in production sold  resulting from lower demand 
production sold in was  tons at an average price of per ton  compared to  tons at an average price of for cost of leonardite sold was  in compared to  in  a decline of 
this decline resulted from the lower production 
production costs per ton were and for and  respectively 
costs per ton for were higher than due to the lower production volume which spread fixed costs over fewer tons 
gross margin for leonardite operations before depreciation and sg a expenses was  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue  for the decline in gross margin was due to the lower production level 
comparison of to consolidated analysis total revenue for increased  or to  from  in this increase was due to the oil revenue increase previously discussed 
total operating costs for increased  or to  from  in operating costs increased in because of higher depletion and sg a expenses 
depletion expense increased due to increases in full cost pool assets associated with horizontal drilling done in and undeveloped locations planned in the next three years 
sg a expense increased because the company made a more substantial contribution to its employees profit sharing plan in light of the higher net income 
due to higher revenue  operating income for increased  or to  compared to  in nonoperating expense for increased  or to  compared to  in higher nonoperating expenses were primarily the result of higher interest expense 
as a result of higher operating income  income before taxes increased  or to  compared to  in income tax expense in was  compared to  in the expense amount for each year reflects the net changes in the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities 
net income for increased  or to  cents per share compared to  cent per share in comparison of to revenue and gross margin oil and gas sales were  in compared to  in  a slight decline of  or 
this essentially stable revenue was due to an decline in average oil prices that was offset by an increase in the volume of oil and gas sold 
the average oil price was compared to an average of in the volume of oil and gas sold in increased to  boe barrels of oil equivalent from  boe in the lower average oil price was entirely due to substantially lower prices in the first half of the average price per boe for the first half of was compared to for the second half of the higher production volumes resulted from and workover and drilling operations and sales from year end inventory 
oil and gas production costs were  in compared to  in  an increase of 
this increase was primarily related to the oil and gas sales volume increase 
production costs on a per equivalent barrel basis averaged for compared to for gross margin for oil and gas operations before deductions for depletion and selling  general and administrative expenses was  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue  for the decline in gross margin was primarily due to lower oil prices previously discussed 
leonardite sales were  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to a increase in production sold 
production sold in was  tons at an average price of  compared to  tons at an average price of for variations in sales volumes and average prices were normal fluctuations associated with drilling mud additive demand levels during and cost of leonardite sold was  in compared to  in  an increase of  or 
this increase resulted from the increase in production 
production costs per ton were and for and  respectively 
costs per ton for were lower than due to the higher production volume which spread fixed costs over more tons 
gross margin for leonardite operations before deductions for depreciation and selling  general and administrative expenses was  or of revenue  compared to  or of revenue  for the increase in gross margin was primarily due to the lower per ton production costs discussed above 
comparison of to consolidated analysis total revenue for increased  or  to  from  in this increase was due to the  leonardite revenue increase previously discussed 
operating costs for declined  or  to  compared to  exclusive of the write down for oil and gas properties in these stable costs resulted from lower depletion expense and higher oil and gas and leonardite production costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses were virtually unchanged from to total operating costs for decreased  or to  from  in due to the  non cash write down of oil and gas properties that increased operating cost in higher total revenue coupled with lower operating costs resulted in operating income of  for nonoperating expenses decreased  from  in to  in  yielding an income before taxes of  in compared to a  loss in income tax expense in was  compared to  in the expense amount for each year is reflective of the net changes in the company s deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities and include only a minimal amount of income taxes currently paid 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the cumulative effect of the change on prior years was reflected as a  benefit in see notes a and f to the financial statements for further information 
net income for was  or cent per share compared to a net loss  after the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for income taxes  of  or cents per share in liquidity and capital resources at year end at december   the company had current assets of  compared to current liabilities of  for a current ratio of 
to and negative working capital of  this compares to a current ratio of 
to at december  this negative working capital was caused by the costs associated with the drilling and completion of the oscar fossum h late in the fourth quarter of the company expects to return to a positive working capital during during the year ended december   the company generated cash flows from operating activities of  which is  greater than the amount generated during management believes that cash flows from operations for should increase above levels particularly if the company continues successful horizontal development of certain of its properties 
during  the company drilled two horizontal wells gross  net in one of its existing fields 
these wells were successful  and the second well was put on production in december the company anticipates that cash flows from operations and bank borrowings will be sufficient to meet its short term cash requirements 
during  the company s investing activities totaled  which was primarily for additions to property  plant and equipment 
part of the source of these funds was  realized from the sale of property and equipment leaving net cash used in investing of  the  cash portion of additions to property and equipment consists of the approximate amounts as follows exploration and development costs of  that included the paid portion of costs for drilling and completing gross net horizontal oil wells  proved property acquisition costs of  that included the cost of acquiring interests in several producing wells  unproved property costs of  primarily for oil and gas lease costs  delay rental costs of  and improvements to the company s leonardite plant of  over and above the additions to property and equipment  the company also used  to fund oil and gas leasehold purchases in the state of washington through its owned subsidiary  belmont natural resource company  inc during  the company s financing activities also utilized  of cash for principal payments required under long term debt agreements 
the sources of cash in for the investing and financing activities discussed above were the cash flows provided by operating activities  the  sale of properties discussed above   of borrowings on the company s revolving line of credit and  of borrowings on the company s revolving line of credit 
during fiscal  the company estimates it will incur development costs of at least  related to the company s proved developed nonproducing and proved undeveloped oil and gas properties 
this estimated amount is somewhat uncertain at this time because the company could  relatively quickly  decide to either increase or reduce the level of horizontal drilling contemplated for other planned expenditures for consist of delay rentals and other exploration costs of approximately  capital expected to be used for principal payments required under existing debt agreements totals management expects to continue to evaluate possible future purchases of additional producing oil and gas properties and the further development of currently owned properties 
management believes the company s long term cash requirements for such investing activities and the repayment of long term debt can be met by the continued future cash flows from operations  the remaining available  of the  line of credit established in and  if necessary  possible additional debt or equity financing
