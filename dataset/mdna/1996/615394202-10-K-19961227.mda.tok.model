item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a leading global designer and manufacturer of a broad range of high performance precision motion and fluid control products and systems for aerospace and industrial applications 
moog s servoactuation systems are critical in controlling the flight of commercial and military aircraft  controlling the thrust of space launch vehicles  steering tactical and strategic missiles  satellite positioning and are used in a wide variety of electric and hydraulic industrial applications that require the precise control of position  velocity and force 
the company has two industry segments  domestic controls and international controls 
these industry segments consist of five principal product lines commercial aircraft  military aircraft  space and missiles collectively referred to as aerospace  industrial hydraulics and industrial electrics collectively referred to as industrial controls 
domestic controls designs and manufactures products primarily for north american markets  while international controls designs and manufactures products for markets in europe and the far east 
the majority of domestic controls segment sales relate to aerospace  with a smaller portion of sales related to industrial controls 
international controls segment sales relate principally to industrial controls  with a relatively small portion related to aerospace 
the company considers select acquisitions to broaden its product lines  enhance market share and improve manufacturing and engineering capabilities and utilization 
in  moog acquired certain hydraulic and mechanical actuation product lines of alliedsignal inc located in torrance  california the aircraft controls acquisition 
the adjusted purchase price  excluding million for specified transition services  was million 
on december   the company purchased for million  the industrial servovalve product line of ultra hydraulics limited ultra 
on october   the company acquired the assets of and assumed certain liabilities related to the industrial hydraulic servocontrols business the us industrial hydraulics business of international motion control inc  imc  an unrelated third party 
the us industrial hydraulics business  which operated under the name moog controls inc  was spun off by the company in february the purchase price for the us industrial hydraulics business was million 
sales 
commercial aerospace and industrial controls accounted for of fiscal sales  with the balance to us and foreign governments for military and space hardware 
over the past five years  the percentage of government sales to total sales has declined as the company has increased its focus on the development and acquisition of commercial aerospace and industrial controls product lines 
in fiscal  government sales were and commercial sales were 
moog expects the percentage of commercial sales to continue to increase based upon expected growth in commercial aerospace and industrial controls 
in commercial aircraft  the company s sales are dependent on the aircraft production cycle of the major oems 
in industrial controls  the company is subject to the normal fluctuations in capital goods spending in regional markets 
sales related to the military aircraft and space and missiles product lines are subject to changes in procurement and spending levels on programs in which the company participates 
while each of its product lines is subject to cyclicality  the company believes the impact is mitigated by their diversity and broad geographic distribution 
cost of sales 
the company s business requires substantial investments in capital equipment  buildings and related support costs 
cost of sales can be affected by changes in both volume and product mix 
the company has a highly skilled workforce  and an infrastructure of engineering and related support costs 
accordingly  short term changes in volume can have a significant effect on gross margins 
these short term changes can be tempered by the long term nature of the aerospace business and the production cycle of major industrial capital goods manufacturers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company s selling  general and administrative expenses are typically higher in industrial controls than in aerospace 
the industrial products generally have higher gross margins  but also require higher sales and support effort 
accordingly  shifts in the sales mix to or from industrial controls will affect selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
these expenses are also affected by the amount of bid and proposal work on government contracts and commission sales 
research and development 
research and development expenses vary depending on whether the engineering staff is engaged in customer funded design and development  sales support  production support or company funded research and development activities 
the company s annual research and development expenses have averaged million over the past five fiscal years 
revenue from design and development activities averaged million or of average sales 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of over the same period a year ago 
net sales for the domestic controls segment were million  above net sales of million a year ago 
the domestic controls net sales increase is attributable to increased volumes in both the commercial and military aircraft product lines  along with higher volumes in satellite and space propulsion controls 
for the international controls segment  net sales increased to million in fiscal compared with million a year ago 
the international controls net sales growth relates principally to increased volumes due to stronger demand for industrial hydraulics throughout europe and  to a lesser degree  the december acquisition of the industrial servovalve product line of ultra 
the movement in the value of certain foreign currencies relative to the us dollar in fiscal did not have a significant impact on sales 
cost of sales for fiscal was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease as a percentage of sales is primarily due to the absence of transition costs in related to the aircraft controls acquisition and to increased sales in the higher margin industrial hydraulics and space and missiles product lines 
research and development expense was million or of net sales for fiscal  compared with million or of net sales in the same period of fiscal the increase principally relates to the development of advanced actuation technology and related electronics and active vibration development efforts in the us related to the commercial and military aircraft product lines

research and development expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the decline was attributable to significant expenditures in fiscal on brushless motor development for entertainment motion platforms  radio controls  engine thrust vectoring controls  and helicopter vibration controls 
further  more engineering resources were utilized on production related activity in fiscal revenue from design and development activities was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or of net sales compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal in absolute terms  the increase was primarily due to a full year of costs in fiscal related to the aircraft controls acquisition 
further  million of the increase reflected the higher average value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar 
the decline  as a percentage of net sales  reflected the additional sales from the aircraft controls acquisition and increased sales in the international controls segment 
operating profit for the domestic controls segment was million in fiscal  representing of segment sales  compared with million  or of segment sales  in fiscal the increase in operating profit was due to the aircraft controls acquisition  in part offset by declining revenue on the b program and certain missile programs  as well as one time transition services costs resulting from the aircraft controls acquisition 
fiscal also included million of inventory obsolescence and restructuring charges 
operating profit for the international controls segment in fiscal was million  or of segment sales compared with million  or of segment sales  in fiscal  which included million of restructuring and inventory obsolescence charges 
excluding these charges  operating profit would have been million  or of segment sales 
the improvement in capital goods markets in europe  along with cost reduction measures  led to a significant improvement in european operating profit 
within the pacific region  operating profit was down from fiscal  primarily due to costs of penetrating new asian markets 
interest expense increased in fiscal to million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in interest expense was due to the additional debt associated with the aircraft controls acquisition 
foreign currency exchange losses of 
million in fiscal compared with a gain of
