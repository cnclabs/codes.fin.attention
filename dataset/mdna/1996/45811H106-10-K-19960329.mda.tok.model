the markets in which the company competes are technologically advanced and highly competitive 
accordingly  the company s continued success requires substantial research and development expenditures 
while developing new products  the company attempts to be cognizant of inventory currently in its possession in order to help mitigate inventory becoming obsolete 
software development expenditures that are not chargeable to specific customer orders are expensed as research and development until technical feasibility is established 
thereafter  such expenditures are capitalized  reflected as other assets at the lower of cost or net realizable value  and amortized over the shorter of the remaining estimated economic life of the related products or five years 
capitalized software development costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
amortization of capitalized software included in cost of sales was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
engineering and development expenditures relating to certain orders are incorporated in the price charged to customers and are reflected in cost of sales 
those costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company expects to continue its commitment to research and development in the future 
in february  the company acquired of the common stock and preference shares of integral vision ltd

seasonality and quarterly fluctuations the company s sales and operating results have varied substantially from quarter to quarter 
net sales and earnings are typically lower in the fourth and first quarters 
the most significant factors affecting these fluctuations are the seasonal buying patterns of the company s customers 
the principal customers for the company s resistance welding control products traditionally make purchases in connection with re tooling for new automobile body styles and tend to purchase the company s equipment in the second and third quarters 
the end users of the company s optical inspection products typically add manufacturing capacity in the second and third quarters in anticipation of higher production requirements in the fourth quarter resulting in a higher level of sales for the company

a significant portion of the purchase of property and equipment relates to the acquisition of an additional building to give the company additional capacity 
accounts receivable decreased due to decreased invoicing activity at the end of the company believes increased invoicing in the future will not increase accounts receivable to prior levels as a percentage of net sales as a result of closer management 
page liquidity and capital resources cont the increase in patents primarily relates to the cross license agreement which was part of the patent litigation settlement finalized in there is also a component of debt which was set up to reflect future payments to be made under this agreement 
the company believes that current financial resources working capital and its ability to obtain additional financing  if needed  together with cash generated from operations  will be adequate to meet cash needs through no significant commitments for capital expenditures existed as of december  the company expects to capitalize approximately  of software development costs in and has no other plans for any significant capital expenditures
