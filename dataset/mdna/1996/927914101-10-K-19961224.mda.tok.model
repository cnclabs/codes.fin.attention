general visio corporation  a washington corporation  visio or the company is a leading supplier of business drawing and diagramming software 
visio r software  introduced in  enables business and technical users to create drawings and diagrams using a drag and drop approach 
customers use the company s software for creating drawings and diagrams ranging from simple diagrams such as flowcharts  block diagrams and organizational charts to complex technical drawings such as space plans  electrical schematics and network designs 
visio s flexible product architecture and powerful graphics engine allow organizations to standardize on a single  easy to use product that meets a broad range of business drawing and diagramming needs  and thereby realize savings on purchasing  training and support 
the company s mission is to become the single standard for creating  storing and exchanging drawings within business 
background drawing and diagramming the visual representation of concepts  processes and relationships can be as important to businesses as words and numbers for communicating and exchanging ideas 
drawings and diagrams can succinctly communicate abstract concepts and relationships such as organizational structures and technical schematics 
business drawings and diagrams  traditionally done by hand using rulers  templates and graph paper  or delegated to specialists such as graphic artists or drafters  are increasingly created using software products 
just as the advent of personal computers made electronic word processing and spreadsheet preparation possible for the general user  the widespread acceptance of easy to use graphical user interfaces has created a similar opportunity for personal computer software to replace traditional paper based drawing and diagramming for general business users 
most existing drawing and diagramming software was introduced for narrowly defined drawing needs  for specialists or as secondary features of office suite products 
for example  single purpose products were created for specific tasks such as flowcharting  organizational charting or network diagramming 
users were confronted with a variety of products  each with a different user interface  and the drawings and diagrams they produced were often difficult to integrate into word processed documents  spreadsheets or presentation materials 
illustration  page layout and cad software has also been created for graphics artists  designers and drafters 
these specialty products generally do not address the needs of nonspecialists who wish to create  share or modify drawings and diagrams 
these products are also generally expensive  may require special system configurations  usually require a substantial investment of time to master and must be used regularly for the investment to be justified and the mastery maintained 
although the drawing capabilities of office suite products were developed for general business users  the company believes that to date they have lacked the depth and breadth of functionality necessary to enable users to easily create a variety of business drawings and diagrams 
the result has been a market highly focused on specific users and fragmented among many applications 
the visio solution to address the limitations of existing drawing and diagramming software  the company introduced visio in november the company s primary products  visio  visio technical and visio professional  offer users solutions based on a single  easy to use technology for a wide variety of drawing and diagramming needs  while add on visio shapes products provide users with additional shapes for particular applications 
all visio products are based on a common graphics engine that drives parametrically defined smartshapes r symbols  intelligent objects and connectors that maintain relationships within and between shapes as they are moved 
visio s smartshapes objects  its stencil metaphor and its drag and drop features allow users with no prior graphics or cad training to select shapes easily  combine them with text and manipulate them to create sophisticated drawings and diagrams 
visio s switchable user interface allows users to select a graphical interface compatible with the leading office suites 
the visio graphics engine employs windows activex technology to embed visio drawings and diagrams into other documents  link documents and incorporate information from other sources into visio drawings and diagrams 
visio utilizes an open architecture that is easily extensible and customizable in order to facilitate and encourage the development of specific solutions by both end users and third party solution providers and to enable the company to expand its products to address new markets 
the company believes that its software is expanding the market for drawing and diagramming software 
visio replaces hand drawing and single use products and moves drawing and diagramming out of the specialist art and drafting departments and onto the desktops of general users throughout business enterprises 
the company s software allows users of visio  visio technical and visio professional to share files created with any other visio product and permits users trained in one product to easily move to another 
most importantly  visio software enables organizations to realize purchasing  training and support savings by standardizing on a common technology that addresses a wide variety of drawing and diagramming needs 
visio s strategy visio s mission is to become the single standard for creating  storing and exchanging drawings within business 
by becoming the standard  the company believes it can introduce new users to electronic drawing and diagramming and thereby expand the market for its products 
the company s strategy to achieve this objective includes the following elements focus on business users 
the company has focused on personal computer based drawing and diagramming for business enterprises such as large corporations  consulting firms and governmental entities 
the company targets enterprises that create durable drawings  share those drawings in electronic form across organizational functions and departments and create custom solutions for specific drawing needs 
the company believes these enterprises are more likely to standardize on a single product and provide the best opportunity for the company to embed its products broadly within an organization 
the company offers these entities a variety of volume licensing arrangements that encourage wide use of  and standardization on  its products 
maintain leading technology and extend product line 
the company s strategy is to maintain and improve the flexibility and extensibility of its graphics engine and increase the ease of use and functionality of its products 
the company will continue to expand its product lines to address market segments where the value of drawings is high and is exploring complementary products 
in december  the company released visio professional  designed for information systems and business process design 
expand use of visio as a platform 
building on visio s open architecture and ease of customization  the company seeks to develop relationships with third party solution providers  system integrators  consultants and other software developers who can create specific content for visio products 
additional content may include new shapes and automated routines that provide solutions to specific industries or businesses 
the company has established the visio solutions library which includes solutions  add ons and content developed by visio and by visio s business partners with market expertise in core industries 
the visio solutions library will complement visio s existing products by providing users the tools to accomplish specific business tasks and optimize enterprise standardization on visio 
the company has established a developer training program which offers a foundation of knowledge for companies and individuals to employ visio graphics technology to meet a broad range of business needs critical to their business 
focus on microsoft windows and the microsoft strategy 
the company develops products primarily for the windows environment and has historically worked closely with microsoft to more fully utilize the capabilities of windows technology 
the company believes that microsoft s strategies for expansion of the windows market will ultimately provide a broad market opportunity for visio products 
the company intends to continue to work closely with microsoft to gain access to new windows technology and exploit it fully in visio products 
the visio license agreement with microsoft to incorporate visual basic for applications vba into the future versions of visio products illustrates the company s strategy to maintain its position as a key developer of products for windows 
expand international markets 
the company markets the visio product line in nine languages and in more than countries throughout the world 
international revenues represented approximately and of the company s revenues in fiscal and  respectively 
the company plans to continue to expand both the number of its products distributed in international markets and its sales and marketing offices and distribution networks within those markets 
separate product teams 
in september  the company reorganized its internal marketing and development organizations into product teams centering on its key product groups 
the company believes this approach creates greater synergy between marketing and development  clearer focus on market needs and greater accountability to the success of a product 
products the company currently sells two core software products  visio and visio technical  together with add on visio shapes software products 
the company recently released a third core product  visio professional 
these products offer solutions to a wide variety of drawing and diagramming needs based on a single  easy to use technology 
the company designs its product features to be intuitive  enabling even occasional users to draw and diagram efficiently 
the company s products integrate well with other desktop applications and can be easily customized to meet individual needs 
many business drawings and diagrams are composed almost entirely of standard symbols 
accordingly  the company s products utilize a visual stencil metaphor 
this metaphor is implemented through a stencil window that displays a collection of standard shapes  including connectors  on a visually distinctive background 
the user incorporates these standard shapes into a drawing by dragging the shapes from the stencil window and dropping them into the drawing window 
in addition  users can customize the behavior of shapes and create their own shapes 
all visio shapes can have associated text  which moves when the shape is moved 
the company s software allows users to associate nongraphical data with shapes  enabling users to easily generate nongraphical information  such as parts lists and bills of material  from visio drawings and diagrams 
visio the company s leading product  visio  was first shipped in november visio enables general business personal computer users to create a wide variety of diagrams 
many of visio s features are designed to optimize its ease of use 
for example  visio incorporates a switchable user interface that enables users to select the microsoft office or lotus smartsuite graphical user interface

in addition to enabling users to easily create diagrams  visio also includes features to enhance the information content of diagrams 
visio users can link diagrams to databases and associate nongraphical data with shapes within a diagram 
some of the diagrams that can be created with visio include flowcharts organization charts timelines block diagrams geographic maps marketing charts the company released visio in august with bit and bit executables in one box 
with visio  users can create new diagram types such as perspective block diagrams for sophisticated spatial representation and mind mapping charts for stimulating creative thinking 
visio includes a new smartshapes wizard that provides users easier access to customizing smart behavior and helps users to create their own smartshapes objects  and includes spellcheck and find and replace features 
visio supports the binder feature of microsoft office  allowing users to create single documents consisting of microsoft word documents  excel spreadsheets  powerpoint presentation slides  visio drawings and diagrams and documents from other binder compatible applications 
access to visio s feature sets through activex automation gives corporate developers and third party solution providers expanded ability to manipulate and automate visio s functionality 
visio has an estimated street price average purchase price paid by end users of visio technical visio technical is designed for technical professionals such as drafters  engineers and architects 
it offers all the features and capabilities of visio  plus shapes and capabilities necessary to create professional quality technical drawings 
visio technical enables users to efficiently create two dimensional drawings and technical schematics without the long learning curve normally associated with cad software 
visio technical users can easily share technical drawings with other windows applications  and can create intelligent drawings by linking them to databases 
visio technical includes more than  industry specific smartshapes objects 
some of the drawings that can be created with visio technical include space planning facilities management electrical schematics construction drawings mechanical engineering heating  ventilation and air conditioning in may  the company released visio technical  which offers improved integration with autodesk autocad files 
visio technical can import and export native autocad files  thereby enabling visio technical users who are not trained on autocad to use autocad files and to share drawings and diagrams with autocad users 
visio technical reads autocad files directly  maintaining all autocad attributes and automatically converting autocad symbol libraries into smartshapes objects 
an append option also allows users to add information in visio technical on top of an imported autocad file 
when the file is exported and opened in autocad  the appended information appears on a new layer and can be manipulated by the autocad user 
other new features for visio technical include a database connectivity wizard which makes it possible to link any visio shape or drawing to any on line database connectivity odbc compliant database  new support for visual basic  over new technical smartshapes symbols on new stencils and powerful new drawing tools

these products supplement visio  visio technical and visio professional by extending the number and types of drawings available for job specific drawing needs 
each visio shapes product includes from to stencils and from to smartshapes objects 
some visio shapes products also include automated routines that further simplify the creation of drawings and diagrams 
the company introduced three new visio shapes products in fiscal the visio shapes products offered by the company  which have estimated street prices ranging from to  are as follows accident reporting chemistry advanced electrical engineering crime scenes advanced flowcharts home planning advanced network diagrams kids advanced software diagrams landscape planning advanced space planning marketing biotechnology medicine mechanical engineering calendar maker network equipment chemical engineering petroleum engineering the company has from time to time offered special versions of its products for specific applications 
for example  the company offers visio express  a version of visio that contains a reduced feature set  for inclusion in certain oem arrangements 
the company also offers the visio business modeler  an add on designed to expedite implementations of the sap r r tm system 
sales  marketing and distribution visio s marketing efforts were initially directed at creating a new product category drawing and diagramming software for general business users 
those marketing efforts were directed at individual end users who purchased the company s products through standard retail software distribution channels 
as the need for drawing and diagramming software for general business users has been recognized  the company has refocused its marketing efforts on strengthening visio brand name recognition to facilitate the introduction of additional visio branded products and on expanding its distribution channels 
in addition  the company is increasingly focusing its sales and marketing efforts on volume licensing arrangements with large accounts 
as a result of this effort  volume licensing revenues have been  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company expects continued investment in the volume licensing sales staff in fiscal and  as a result  expects this percentage to increase 
in north america  the company s products are sold primarily through distributors  including ingram micro  inc ingram  merisel  inc 
merisel and tech data corporation tech data 
these distributors resell the company s products to retail software outlets and computer superstores 
the company also sells its products directly to egghead  inc egghead 
the company has entered into nonexclusive distribution agreements with each of ingram  merisel and tech data and a nonexclusive resellers agreement with egghead 
the agreements with egghead  ingram and tech data may be terminated without cause by either party upon days notice 
the agreement with merisel is automatically renewed on an annual basis and may be terminated without cause by either party upon days notice 
in fiscal  and  sales to the company s three largest distributors and resellers accounted for the following percentages of the company s revenues ingram  and  respectively  merisel  and  respectively  and egghead  and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of the company s revenues in those fiscal years 
distribution outside of north america is also primarily through distributors and is managed by the company s international headquarters in dublin and regional sales and marketing offices in london  munich  paris  sydney  kuala lumpur and miami 
internationally  the company has numerous non exclusive distributors  none of which accounted for of the company s revenues in fiscal  or the international headquarters personnel are responsible for all international administration  finance  manufacturing  customer support  localization and local content engineering 
in japan  the company has a distribution agreement with ascii something good corporation asg which provides for exclusive distribution rights  excluding direct sales and licensing by visio  through march   and non exclusive distribution rights through december   except that asg retains exclusive distribution rights for license packs and volume licenses through december  the company from time to time has established oem arrangements with hardware manufacturers such as dell computer corporation and acer incorporated and software vendors such as microsoft corporation 
the company also sells products directly to end users 
the company outsources technical support and customer service 
to the extent it remains economically advantageous to do so  the company expects to continue to outsource these functions in the future 
product development the company believes that its future success will depend in large part on its ability to enhance its current product line  develop new products  maintain technological leadership and satisfy an evolving range of customer requirements and industry standards for drawing and diagramming software 
the company s product development group is actively engaged in identifying  defining and developing new products and product enhancements to meet customer needs 
the company s principal product development efforts focus on continued enhancements to the visio graphics engine and development of new customer solutions and applications  including increased drawing complexity  increased number of objects  increased smartness of smartshapes objects and improved database connectivity 
the company s products have been developed primarily by its product development group 
certain technologies  such as the ability to read and write to autocad files and to spellcheck  have been licensed from other sources and integrated into the company s products 
the company intends to continue licensing technologies as it increases product offerings 
in fiscal  the company purchased source code and other intellectual property from arcland  inc to be integrated into the company s products 
the company intends to continue to make substantial investments in product development 
the company s product development expenses totaled million  million and million  or  and of revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
as a developer of products designed to operate on microsoft windows  the company has historically enjoyed a collaborative working relationship with microsoft 
for example  the company participated in early design reviews and beta testing of versions and of microsoft s ole standard and commented on design requirements for the graphics subsystem of windows the company was an early beta tester of  and participated in microsoft s early adopter marketing program for  windows the company released visio concurrently with microsoft s launch of windows  and released visio technical shortly thereafter 
if the company s relationship with microsoft were disrupted for any reason  the company s development efforts and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
competition the computer software drawing and diagramming markets are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology and evolving standards 
the company competes primarily with small niche companies and larger software companies with strong market position and technology 
the company s principal competitors are companies with leading products in the special purpose drawing and diagramming  illustration  cad and office suite categories 
products competing with visio include abc flowcharter by micrografx  corelflow and coreldraw by corel and intellidraw by adobe 
visio technical competes with various products  including autocad lt and autosketch by autodesk and designer by micrografx 
visio professional competes with various products including netviz by quyen systems inc and process charter by scitor corporation 
in addition  the drawing capabilities included in microsoft office  smartsuite by lotus and wordperfect suite by corel compete with visio 
if any of these producers of office suites aggressively pursues business drawing and diagramming markets and commits further resources to development in this area  the company s results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
many of these competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources than the company 
as business drawing and diagramming software markets develop  the company believes that additional companies may enter these markets and thereby intensify competition 
the principal competitive factors affecting the computer software drawing and diagramming markets include product functionality  ease of use  performance and reliability  customer service and support  product availability  vendor credibility  brand awareness  ability to keep pace with technological change  and price 
although the company believes that its products currently compete favorably with respect to these factors  there can be no assurance that the company can maintain its competitive position in the face of increasing competition from new products and enhancements introduced by existing competitors and new companies entering this market 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by significant price competition  and the company expects it will face increasing pricing pressures 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by the company will not materially adversely affect its business  financial condition and results of operations 
proprietary rights the company regards its software as proprietary and relies primarily on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secret protection  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  including nondisclosure agreements with employees and others  to protect is proprietary rights 
the company has no patents or patent applications pending and existing copyright and trade secret laws afford only limited protection 
the company believes that  because of the rapid pace of technological change in the computer software industry  copyright and trade secret protection have less effect on the company s business and results of operations than factors such as the knowledge  ability and experience of the company s employees  frequent product enhancements and the timeliness and quality of support services 
the company provides its products to business enterprises under nonexclusive licenses that are generally nontransferable 
the company also provides its products to individual end users  in which case the company relies on shrink wrap licenses that are not signed by the end user and therefore may not be enforceable in certain jurisdictions 
the company s products do not contain copy protection 
policing unauthorized use of software is difficult and  while the company is unable to determine the extent of piracy of its software  it expects software piracy to be a persistent problem in the computer software industry 
the company licenses some software programs from independent developers and incorporates them into the company s products 
generally  such agreements grant the company nonexclusive  perpetual  worldwide licenses with respect to the subject program and terminate only upon a material breach by the company 
certain of these licenses require payment of royalties based on the number of products sold 
no material claims have been made against the company for infringement of proprietary rights of others  however  there can be no assurance that others will not assert infringement claims in the future 
as the number of software products in the industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps  the company believes that software programs will increasingly become subject to infringement claims 
the cost of responding to any such assertion may be material  whether or not the assertion is valid 
production production of the company s software products primarily involves duplication of various media and the printing of user manuals and packaging materials 
media for the company s products include cd roms and inch diskettes and are available from multiple sources 
the company outsources procurement of materials for  and production of  its products 
to date  the company has not experienced any material difficulties or delays in production of its software products or documentation 
to the extent it remains economically advantageous to do so  the company intends to continue outsourcing production in the future 
employees as of september   the company employed persons  including in sales and marketing  customer service and technical support  in product development and in finance  administration and operations 
the company believes that its future success will depend  in part  on its ability to continue to attract and retain skilled product development  technical support  marketing and management personnel 
competition for such personnel in the computer software industry is intense 
the company believes its relations with its employees are good 
item properties the company s headquarters are located in seattle  washington  where it leases approximately  square feet for administrative  sales and marketing  customer service and product development activities 
the company also leases approximately  square feet of office space in dublin  ireland and an aggregate of  square feet of office space in london  munich  paris and kuala lumpur 
the company believes that its existing facilities and options on additional facilities are adequate to meet its needs for the foreseeable future 
the company believes that it can acquire additional space  if needed  on acceptable terms 
item legal proceedings the company is not a party to any material legal proceedings

all of the company s products have been developed for the microsoft windows  windows and windows nt operating systems and are marketed under the visio r brand 
the company s primary products are visio  visio technical and visio professional 
the company s first product visio  which first shipped in november  began creating a new market for business diagramming 
the company shipped its second significant product line  visio technical  for technical drawing in december the company has announced the introduction of its third significant product line to be released in december  visio professional  for information systems and business process design 
visio classifies its revenues in four channels distribution  direct  volume licensing  and oem 
distribution revenues represent sales of packaged products through national distributors and corporate  retail and mail order resellers 
direct revenues represent sales of packaged products directly by the company  including upgrades  generally to end users responding to advertising or other marketing promotions 
volume licensing revenues are derived from volume licenses  which are generally administered through corporate resellers after the company s sales staff has negotiated the sale 
the typical sales cycle for a volume license is six to eighteen months 
volume licensing revenues usually do not include any significant amount of packaged goods  but do include maintenance and support revenues  which are priced separately and recognized over the lives of the contracts 
volume licensing revenues characteristically have higher gross profit as a percentage of revenues  but lower operating profit as a percentage of revenues  due to costs of supporting the related sales staff 
oem revenues include licenses of visio products to hardware and software manufacturers for bundling arrangements 
oem revenues include packaged product sales  as well as royalty payments with no associated product costs 
the distribution channel commonly stocks and displays packaged products to achieve in store visibility and timely delivery to customers 
fluctuations in distributor inventory levels can affect the company s revenues 
distributor inventory levels may fluctuate for a variety of reasons  including the inability of distributors to sell a product at the levels purchased  as well as the phenomena called channel dry and channel fill 
channel dry occurs prior to the release of an upgrade version of an existing product as the distribution channel reduces the inventory levels to minimize product returns 
channel fill occurs following the introduction of a new product or new version of a product  in anticipation of price increases  in response to planned end user promotions and in connection with purchases of additional display space 
the company defers the recognition of revenues from distributor inventory that it estimates to be in excess of levels appropriate for the channel 
nonetheless  the effects of channel fill could add substantial volatility to the company s revenues 
the company has invested heavily in the development of its core graphics technology  new product introductions  visio brand awareness and its worldwide infrastructure 
these investments are part of the company s strategy for growth and are consistent with its mission to become the single standard for creating  storing and exchanging drawings and diagrams in business 
although the company believes that these investments have established a foundation for the worldwide expansion of its business  they have also significantly affected the company s historical profitability 
there can be no assurance that the company s revenue growth will be sufficient in future periods to maintain its recent profitability as the company continues to make such investments 
results of operations the following table sets forth statement of income data as a percentage of revenues for the fiscal years indicated year ended september  revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating income interest and other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss revenues in thousands change change business diagramming    technical drawing    other  total revenues    revenues include sales of software products  maintenance and support contracts and licenses  net of reserves for estimated future returns and allowances 
revenues from the sale of maintenance and support contracts have not been material to date 
license revenues are derived from volume licenses  international royalties and certain oem arrangements 
visio s revenues increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  and to million in the fiscal year ended september  the increase in revenues was due primarily to sales volume growth across product groups  distribution channels and geographic regions and secondarily to price increases 
percentage growth within the product groups was most significant for the technical drawing product group  which grew and for fiscal and  respectively 
upgrades to visio technical in fiscal and visio technical in fiscal  as well as the introduction of three localized language versions in fiscal  contributed to this growth 
the growth in the business diagramming product group was also strong  growing and for fiscal and  respectively 
upgrades to visio in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the introduction of a japanese version of visio in fiscal  which was upgraded in fiscal  contributed to this growth 
other revenues consisted primarily of sales of visio home and related visio shapes products  which represented a decreasing percentage of total revenues due to the company s focus on business personal computer users 
the channel mix of distribution  direct  volume licensing and oem revenues for fiscal was   and  respectively  compared to   and  respectively  for fiscal and   and  respectively  for fiscal percentage growth was most significant for the volume licensing channel  which grew and for fiscal and  respectively 
this growth is primarily the result of continued infrastructure investment in the volume licensing program 
revenues in the united states and canada increased to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in revenues in fiscal and primarily reflects the contribution of visio technical and the release of upgrade versions of visio and visio technical 
international revenues increased to million in fiscal and to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of total revenues  international revenues represented  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the growth in fiscal primarily reflects the release of upgrade localized versions of visio  particularly in japan  and the introduction of visio technical in europe 
the growth in fiscal resulted primarily from increased distribution revenues due to continued expansion of the customer base  oem revenues from certain promotions and the introduction of a japanese version of visio in march the company s operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates 
approximately  and of the company s revenues were collected in foreign currencies during fiscal  and  respectively 
since most of the company s international production costs and operating expenses are incurred in foreign currencies  the net impact of exchange rate fluctuations on income from operations is less than on revenues 
cost of revenues in thousands change change cost of revenues    cost of revenues varies with the mix of distribution  direct  volume licensing and oem revenues  due to relative variations in the standard costs associated with each revenue category  and with fluctuations in period costs 
standard costs consist primarily of documentation  packaging  media duplication  assembly and material management costs 
period costs consist primarily of technical support  production management  freight and fulfillment  certain royalties  standard material variances and inventory valuation adjustments 
standard costs associated with each revenue category are primarily determined by the amount of packaged product delivered in that revenue category 
accordingly  most of the company s standard costs are associated with distribution and direct revenues  all of which are derived from sales of packaged products 
volume licensing revenues have the lowest standard costs because they generally do not include any significant amount of packaged goods 
the decrease in cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues in fiscal resulted primarily from increased volume licensing revenues which have little or no standard costs  an increase in the percentage of revenue from visio technical  which has lower standard costs as a percentage of revenues than visio  disk duplication cost control measures and the increased use of lower cost cd rom media 
research and development in thousands change change research and development    research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel  contract services  occupancy and equipment costs required to conduct the company s product development efforts 
product development includes product engineering  documentation development  localization  usability testing  quality assurance and advanced research and development costs 
contract localization costs and lump sum payments for technology such as file converters are capitalized and amortized to development over the lesser of the useful life or months 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
generally accepted accounting principles requiring capitalization of certain software development costs subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are not applicable because these costs have been immaterial 
increases in research and development expenses for fiscal resulted primarily from planned additions to the company s development organization and the acquisition of source code and other intellectual property from arcland  inc research and development expenses for fiscal increased primarily due to planned additions to the company s development organization  much of which occurred in dublin where the company established the development organization required to deliver international versions of its products 
the company believes increased research and development expenses in absolute dollars will be required during fiscal and beyond to expand its product lines and introduce new language versions to international markets 
sales and marketing in thousands change change sales and marketing    sales and marketing expenses  which include customer service expenses  have increased in absolute terms as the company continues building its worldwide sales  marketing and customer service infrastructure 
the fiscal growth in these expenses was primarily due to increased product marketing costs  continued development of the worldwide sales infrastructure and the creation of an internal consulting group to support customers and developers 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal primarily due to increased revenues and the significant sales and marketing investment made in fiscal this investment consisted primarily of brand awareness activities including an advertising campaign aimed at developing the visio brand and accelerating awareness levels 
the company believes substantial spending on marketing awareness and volume licensing sales staffing is essential to achieve revenue growth and to maintain and enhance the company s competitive position 
accordingly  visio expects sales and marketing expenses to continue to increase in fiscal general and administrative in thousands change change general and administrative    general and administrative expenses increased in absolute terms in fiscal primarily due to higher personnel costs associated with increased operations  outside legal and accounting fees and costs associated with becoming a public company 
the increase in fiscal resulted primarily from increased staffing and occupancy costs in the dublin office 
the company expects to show increased general and administrative expenses in absolute terms in future periods for infrastructure to support revenue growth 
interest and other income  net interest income was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to interest earned on investment of proceeds from the company s initial public offering completed in november  and was partially offset by other nonoperating expenses 
other income includes foreign currency transaction gains and losses and grant income from the industrial development agency of ireland tied to employment levels in the company s dublin operation

income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the lower effective tax rate for fiscal was primarily due to the benefit of the utilization of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  tax exempt interest and income taxed in other jurisdictions at rates lower than the us rate 
the income tax provision for fiscal of  is primarily related to taxes on us income  with no tax benefit recognized for foreign tax losses

fluctuations in quarterly performance 
the company s quarterly results of operations can be affected substantially by demand for the company s products  the timing and customer acceptance of new products  product enhancements and promotions by the company or its competitors  product returns  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  the impact of acquisitions of other technologies or companies and changes in economic conditions 
the company is increasingly focusing its sales efforts on volume licensing to large accounts 
the timing of those licenses could significantly affect quarterly results of operations 
a significant portion of the company s operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  and planned expenditures are based on the company s estimates for quarterly revenues 
as a result  variations in timing of revenues can cause significant variations in quarterly results of operations 
in general  the company has experienced the strongest demand for its software products during the december quarter and the weakest demand in the june quarter 
these seasonal patterns have been overshadowed in particular quarters by the timing of new product introductions  expansion into international markets  the execution of volume licenses and other factors affecting the company s business 
dependence on microsoft windows  relationship with microsoft 
substantially all of the company s revenues are derived from sales of products that are designed to work within a microsoft windows environment and are marketed primarily to windows users 
as a result  sales of the company s products would be materially affected by market developments adverse to windows based products 
as a developer of products for windows  the company has historically enjoyed a collaborative working relationship with microsoft 
if the relationship were disrupted for any reason  such as a decision by microsoft to introduce or acquire products that compete directly with the company s products  the company s development efforts and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
competition 
the computer software drawing and diagramming markets are intensely competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology and evolving standards 
the software industry has limited barriers to entry  and the availability of personal computers with continuously expanding capabilities  at progressively lower prices  contributes to the ease of market entry 
because of this and other factors  competitive conditions in the future are likely to intensify 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by significant price competition  and the company expects it will face increasing pricing pressures 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced profit margins and loss of market share  which could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
dependence on a single technology  limited product line 
the company has derived substantially all of its revenues to date from sales of drawing and diagramming products based on its core technology 
the visio product line and related enhancements are expected to continue to account for substantially all of the company s revenues for the foreseeable future 
a decline in demand for these products as a result of competition  technological change or any other reason would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
rapid technological change and new product development 
the markets for the company s products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs and frequent new product introductions 
the company s future success will depend on its ability to enhance its current products  to develop new products that meet changing customer needs on a timely and cost effective basis and to respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
any failure by the company to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences  or any significant delays in product development or introduction  would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
management of growth and future acquisitions 
the company has recently experienced rapid growth that has placed  and will continue to place  a significant strain on its management and operations 
the company s ability to manage its growth effectively will require it to improve its operating  financial and management information systems and to attract  train  motivate  manage and retain key employees 
furthermore  the company intends to enter into strategic relationships and make strategic acquisitions of technologies and businesses in order to expand its product lines and the capabilities of its current products 
the risks associated with acquisitions including increased costs and uncertain benefits and the ability to integrate operations of acquired companies could adversely affect the company s results of operations 
risks associated with international operations 
the company expects that international sales will account for an increasing portion of its revenues 
most of the company s international revenues are denominated in foreign currencies 
consequently  a decrease in the value of a relevant foreign currency in relation to the us dollar occurring after establishing prices and before receipt of payment by the company would have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
the company does not currently engage in foreign currency hedging transactions  although it may engage in such transactions in the future 
change in licensing and marketing methods 
the company is increasingly emphasizing sales to enterprises through volume  installment and enterprise licensing arrangements 
these licensing arrangements typically involve a longer cycle up to months from first contact to execution of an initial license than sales through other distribution channels  require a greater investment of resources in establishing the enterprise relationship and result in lower operating margins 
the timing of the execution of volume licenses  or their nonrenewal or renegotiation by large customers  could cause volatility in the company s quarterly results of operations and could materially adversely affect its results of operations 
continued reliance on resellers and distributors 
the company expects to continue to rely on resellers and distributors for sales of its products in domestic and international markets 
sales to the company s two largest distributors and its largest reseller during fiscal  and accounted for an aggregate of  and of the company s revenues  respectively 
the distribution channels through which software products are sold have been characterized by rapid change  including consolidations and financial difficulties of certain distributors and resellers  the emergence of new resellers such as general mass merchandisers and the development of new channels such as electronic networks 
the company s resellers and distributors carry competing product lines 
there can be no assurance that resellers and distributors will continue to purchase the company s products or be able to market them effectively or that the company will be able to effectively distribute its products through new distribution channels 
reliance on outsourcing 
the company outsources most of the production of its products  which primarily involves duplication of various media and the printing of user manuals and packaging materials 
in addition  the company outsources procurement  order fulfillment  technical support  customer service and localization of its products 
so long as it remains economically advantageous to do so  the company intends to continue  and possibly to increase  outsourcing in the future 
although the company believes that it has adequate alternative suppliers of such services  the loss of a supplier or its inability to perform contracted services could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations 
dependence on proprietary technology 
the company s ability to compete effectively depends in large part on its ability to develop and maintain proprietary aspects of its technology 
the company relies on a combination of copyright and trademark laws  trade secret protection  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  including nondisclosure agreements with employees and others  to protect its proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that such measures will be adequate to protect the company s proprietary intellectual property or that claims of infringement of third parties intellectual property rights will not occur 
in addition  the cost of responding to an intellectual property litigation claim  both in legal fees and expenses and the diversion of management resources  whether or not the claim is valid  could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
dependence on key personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant extent on senior management and technical personnel 
the company s growth and future success will depend in large part on its continuing ability to hire  motivate and retain highly qualified management  technical  sales and marketing personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in hiring  motivating or retaining such qualified personnel 
reliance on independent developers for future market expansion 
the company has designed its technology with an open architecture and has incorporated certain features to encourage independent solution providers  system integrators and other software developers to design industry or customer specific drawing and diagramming solutions that will extend the adoption and use of the company s products 
there can be no assurance  however  that developers will design solutions to extend the company s products  and the failure of these development efforts to materialize could adversely affect the expansion of the markets for the company s products 
if independent developers do design solutions for specific industries or customers  the company could be effectively precluded from offering add on products that address the same industries or customers
