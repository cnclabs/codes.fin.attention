item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
all information is based on the company s fiscal calendar 
tabular information dollars in millions  except per share amounts results of operations change change net sales    gross margin   percentage of net sales research and development percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales restructuring costs nm nm percentage of net sales interest and other income expense  net nm net income loss earnings loss per share nm not meaningful overview during the last nine months of  the company experienced a significant decline in net sales  units shipped  and share of the personal computer market 
this decline in demand and the resulting losses  coupled with intense price competition throughout the industry  led to the company s decision to implement a new strategic direction intended to improve the company s competitiveness and restore its profitability 
the company has initiated programs to develop and market products and services more selectively targeted to education  home  and business segments 
in moving in this new strategic direction  the company expects to reduce the number of new product introductions and the number of products in certain categories within its current product portfolio 
net sales net sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing  million  or   million  or  and million  or  during the twelve  nine  and three months ended september   respectively  compared with the same periods in  due to a decrease in net sales of macintosh registered trademark computers and of peripheral products such as displays and printers 
total macintosh computer unit sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing   and during the twelve  nine  and three months ended september   respectively  compared with the same periods in this decline in unit sales was a result of a decline or lack of growth in worldwide demand for all product families  which the company believes was due principally to customer concerns regarding the company s strategic direction  financial condition  and future prospects  and due to delays in the shipment of certain powerbook registered trademark products as a result of quality problems 
in addition  unit sales of peripheral products trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing   and during the twelve  nine and three months ended september   respectively  compared with the same periods in  for the reasons noted above 
the average aggregate revenue per macintosh unit increased slightly during the twelve and three months ended september   and decreased slightly during the nine months ended september   compared with the same periods in  primarily due to a continued shift in product mix toward the company s newer products and products with multimedia configurations  offset to varying degrees by pricing actions across all product lines in order to stimulate demand 
the average aggregate revenue per peripheral product was flat during the twelve  nine  and three months ended september  compared with the same periods in the average revenue per macintosh and per peripheral unit will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors  including industrywide pricing pressures and increased competition 
international net sales represented of net sales in compared with of net sales in international net sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing  and during the twelve  nine  and three months ended september   respectively  compared with the same periods in net sales in european markets trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing during the twelve  nine  and three months ended september  compared with the same periods in  as a result of a decrease in macintosh and peripheral unit sales  partially offset by an increase in the average aggregate revenue per macintosh and per peripheral unit  primarily during the first part of the year 
net sales in japan trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing during the twelve  nine  and three months ended september  compared with the same periods in an increase in macintosh unit sales during these periods was more than offset by a decrease in the average aggregate revenue per macintosh and per peripheral unit and a decrease in peripheral unit sales 
domestic net sales trended downward beginning in the second quarter of  decreasing by   and for the twelve  nine  and three months ended september   respectively  compared with the corresponding periods in  resulting from a decline or lack of growth in demand for all product families 
according to an industry source  in the fourth quarter of compared with the fourth quarter of  the company s share of the worldwide and us personal computer markets declined to from  and to from  respectively 
net sales increased  million  or  in over  primarily due to a combination of unit growth  higher average selling prices  and changes in currency exchange rates 
total macintosh computer unit sales increased approximately over the prior year 
this unit sales growth resulted principally from strong sales of the company s power macintosh registered trademark products  which accounted for more than of total unit shipments during the fourth quarter of  compared with in the comparable period of  and from sales of newer product offerings within the performa registered trademark family of desktop personal computers 
this unit growth was partially offset by declining unit sales of certain of the company s older product offerings 
the average aggregate revenue per macintosh unit increased in compared with  primarily due to a shift in product mix toward the company s newer products and products with multimedia configurations 
international net sales represented of net sales in compared with of net sales in international net sales grew in from  primarily reflecting strong net sales growth in the pacific region  particularly japan 
domestic net sales increased in over in general  the company s resellers purchase products on an as needed basis 
resellers frequently change delivery schedules and order rates depending on changing market conditions 
unfilled orders backlog can be  and often are  canceled at will 
the company attempts to fill orders on the requested delivery schedules 
however  products may be in relatively short supply from time to time until production volumes have reached a level sufficient to meet demand or if other production or fulfillment constraints exist 
the company s backlog was approximately million at november   and consisted primarily of the company s powerbook products  as well as higher end power macintosh products 
in the company s experience  the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects 
in particular  backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following introduction of new products because of overordering by dealers anticipating shortages 
backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply 
because of the foregoing  as well as other factors affecting the company s backlog  backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the company s future revenue or financial performance 
the company believes that net sales will remain below the level of the prior year s comparable periods through at least the first quarter of  if not later 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve sales levels in the first quarter of comparable to the levels achieved in the fourth quarter of gross margin gross margin represents the difference between the company s net sales and its cost of goods sold 
the amount of revenue generated by the sale of products is influenced principally by the price set by the company for its products relative to competitive products 
the cost of goods sold is based primarily on the cost of components and  to a lesser extent  direct labor costs 
the type and cost of components included in particular configurations of the company s products such as memory and disk drives are often directly related to the need to market products in configurations competitive with those of other manufacturers 
competition in the personal computer industry is intense  and in the short term  frequent changes in pricing and product configuration are often necessary in order to remain competitive 
accordingly  gross margin as a percentage of net sales can be significantly influenced in the short term by actions undertaken by the company in response to industrywide competitive pressures 
gross margin decreased to in compared with in this decrease is primarily the result of a million charge in the second quarter of for the write down of certain inventory  as well as the costs to cancel excess component orders  necessitated by significantly lower than expected demand for many of the company s products  primarily its entry level products 
also  the company separately incurred approximately million in charges during the last nine months of to provide for the estimated costs to correct certain quality problems in certain entry level  performa  powerbook and peripheral products  covering both goods held in inventory and shipped goods 
the company also incurred greater warranty expenses per unit sold during compared with in addition  this decrease in gross margins is due to the company s response to extreme competitive actions by other companies attempting to gain market share  including the company s pricing actions in the united states  japan and europe across most product lines  which were partially offset by a decrease in the cost of certain product components 
in the first quarter of  the company took  and the company expects that it will continue to take  similar pricing actions with respect to a number of product lines 
the decrease in gross margin levels was slightly offset by hedging gains  net of the effects of a stronger us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies 
the company s operating and pricing strategies take into account changes in exchange rates over time  however  the company s results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
gross margin increased both in amount and as a percentage of net sales in compared with the increase in gross margin as a percentage of net sales was primarily a result of a shift in product mix toward the company s newer  high margin products  which included strong sales of certain products within the company s power macintosh family of personal computers and its macintosh performa family 
the increase in gross margin levels was affected favorably by changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of a weaker us dollar relative to certain foreign currencies in compared with although gross margin for was  it improved to during the fourth quarter  primarily as a result of lower component costs  sales of fully reserved product  and a shift in product mix toward the company s newer products and products with multimedia configurations  which tend to have higher margins 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to sustain the gross margin level achieved in the fourth quarter 
gross margins will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors  including continued industrywide pricing pressures  increased competition  and compressed product life cycles 
gross margins could also be affected by the company s ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs  and to stimulate demand for certain of its products 
research and development change change research and development percentage of net sales research and development expenditures decreased slightly in when compared with  primarily due to the termination of certain third party joint development efforts 
the increase as a percentage of net sales resulted from a decrease in the level of net sales 
the increase in research and development expenditures during compared with reflected higher project and headcount related spending 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales was the result of revenue growth in over the company believes that continued investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to continued  timely development of new and enhanced products 
the company believes that research and development expenditures in will be comparable to those in selling  general and administrative change change selling  general and administrative    percentage of net sales selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively flat  but increased as a percentage of net sales  in compared with the increase as a percentage of net sales in when compared with was the result of reduced net sales 
in  selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a result of increased advertising and channel marketing programs 
the decrease as a percentage of net sales was primarily the result of the sales growth in over as a result of its restructuring plan  the company expects that selling  general and administrative expenditures in will decrease compared with levels 
restructuring costs for information regarding the company s restructuring actions  refer to page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income expense  net change change interest and other income expense  net nm interest and other income expense  net  increased to million in income in from million in expense in this million favorable change is primarily composed of a favorable variance of million related to net realized and unrealized foreign exchange hedging gains  and lower foreign exchange hedging costs  primarily as a result of lower market and option volatility  higher us interest rates compared with rates abroad  and reduced foreign currency cash flows  an increase of million related to realized gains on the sale of most of the company s available for sale and other equity securities during  offset by a million unfavorable variance related to interest income expense  as a result of higher average debt balances and lower average cash balances during the year  and an overall decline in average interest rate yields 
in addition  the company s cost of funds has increased as a result of the downgrading from january through may of its short term debt to np and c by moody s investor services and standard and poor s rating agency  respectively  and of its long term debt to b and b by moody s investor services and standard and poor s rating agency  respectively 
in  interest and other income expense  net  decreased to million in expense from million in expense in this million favorable change was primarily composed of million in interest income expense attributable to higher average cash balances  higher interest rates  and interest rate hedging gains  offset in part by a million unfavorable variance related to realized and unrealized foreign exchange hedging losses and foreign exchange hedging costs 
market volatility and higher foreign currency balances accounted for the increased hedging costs

provision benefit for income taxes change change provision benefit for income taxes nm effective tax rate at september   the company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences  tax losses  and tax credits of million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the company s balance sheet 
a substantial portion of this asset is realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities 
realization of approximately million of the asset is dependent on the company s ability to generate approximately million of future us taxable income 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the asset will be realized based on forecasted us income 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will meet its expectations of future us income 
as a result  the amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near and long term if estimates of future taxable us income are reduced 
such an occurrence could materially adversely affect the company s financial results and condition 
the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
for additional information regarding income taxes  refer to pages of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s future operating results and financial condition are dependent on the company s ability to successfully develop  manufacture  and market technologically innovative products in order to meet dynamic customer demand patterns 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results and financial condition include  without limitation  continued competitive pressures in the marketplace and the effect of any reaction by the company to such competitive pressures  including pricing actions by the company  the ability of the company to make timely delivery to the marketplace of successful technological innovations  the effects of significant adverse publicity  the company s ability to supply products in certain categories  and uncertainties concerning the company s ability to successfully implement its new strategic direction and restructuring actions 
the company expects that it will not return to sustained profitability until at least the second quarter of  if not later 
restructuring of operations during  the company began to implement certain restructuring actions aimed at reducing its cost structure  improving its competitiveness  and restoring sustained profitability 
there are several risks inherent in the company s efforts to transition to a new cost structure 
these include the risk that the company will not be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough to restore sustained profitability and the risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair the company s ability to innovate and remain competitive in the computer industry 
as part of its restructuring effort  the company has begun to implement a new business model 
implementation of the new business model involves several risks  including the risk that by simplifying its product line the company will increase its dependence on fewer products  potentially reduce overall sales  and increase its reliance on unproven products and technology 
another risk of the new business model is that by increasing the proportion of the company s products to be manufactured under outsourcing arrangements  the company could lose control of the quality or quantity of the products manufactured  or lose the flexibility to make timely changes in production schedules in order to respond to changing market conditions 
in addition  the new business model could adversely affect employee morale  thereby damaging the company s ability to retain and motivate employees 
also  because the new business model contemplates that the company will rely to a greater extent on collaboration and licensing arrangements with third parties  the company will have less direct control over certain of its research and development efforts  and its ability to create innovative new products may be reduced 
finally  even if the new business model is successfully implemented  there can be no assurance that it will effectively resolve the various issues currently facing the company 
in addition  although the company believes that the actions it is taking under its restructuring plan should help restore marketplace confidence in the macintosh platform  there can be no assurance that such actions will be successful 
for the foregoing reasons there can be no assurance that the current restructuring actions will achieve their goals or that similar actions will not be required in the future 
the company s future operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected should it encounter difficulty in effectively managing the transition to the new business model and cost structure 
for more information regarding the company s restructuring actions initiated in the second quarter of  refer to page of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
product introductions and transitions due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry  which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances  the company frequently introduces new products and product enhancements 
the success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors  including market acceptance  the company s ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions  the availability of application software for new products  the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand  the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand  and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction 
accordingly  the company cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations 
in addition  although the number of new product introductions may decrease under the company s new business model  the risks and uncertainties associated with new product introductions may increase as the company refocuses its product offerings on key growth segments 
the rate of product shipments immediately following introduction of a new product is not necessarily an indication of the future rate of shipments for that product  which depends on many factors  some of which are not under the control of the company 
these factors may include initial large purchases by a small segment of the user population that tends to purchase new technology prior to its acceptance by the majority of users early adopters  purchases in satisfaction of pent up demand by users who anticipated new technology and  as a result  deferred purchases of other products  and overordering by dealers who anticipate shortages due to the aforementioned factors 
these factors may be offset by others  such as the deferral of purchases by many users until new technology is accepted as proven and for which commonly used software products are available  and the reduction of orders by dealers once they believe they can obtain sufficient supply of products previously in backlog 
backlog is often volatile after new product introductions due to the aforementioned demand factors  often increasing coincident with introduction  and then decreasing once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply of the new products 
the measurement of demand for newly introduced products is further complicated by the availability of different product configurations  which may include various types of built in peripherals and software 
configurations may also require certain localization such as language for various markets and  as a result  demand in different geographic areas may be a function of the availability of third party software in those localized versions 
for example  the availability of european language versions of software products manufactured by us producers may lag behind the availability of us versions by a quarter or more 
this may result in lower initial demand for the company s new products outside the united states  even though localized versions of the company s products may be available 
the increasing integration of functions and complexity of operations of the company s products also increase the risk that latent defects or other faults could be discovered by customers or end users after volumes of products have been produced or shipped 
if such defects were significant  the company could incur material recall and replacement costs under product warranties 
competition the personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices  downward pressure on gross margins  frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles  continual improvement in product price performance characteristics  price sensitivity on the part of consumers  and a large number of competitors 
during  the company s results of operations and financial condition were  and in the future may continue to be  adversely affected by industrywide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins 
the industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality and hardware performance and features based on existing or emerging industry standards 
many of the company s competitors have greater financial  marketing  manufacturing  and technological resources  broader product lines  and larger installed customer bases than those of the company 
the company s future operating results and financial condition may be affected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features over another 
the company is currently the primary maker of hardware that uses the macintosh operating system mac registered trademark os 
the mac os has a minority market share in the personal computer market  which is dominated by makers of computers that run the ms dos and microsoft windows operating systems 
the company believes that the mac os  with its perceived advantages over ms dos and windows  has been a driving force behind sales of the company s personal computer hardware for the past several years 
recent innovations in the windows platform  including those introduced by windows  have added features to the windows platform similar to those offered by the mac os 
the company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the windows platform 
the company s future operating results and financial condition may be affected by its ability to maintain and increase the installed base for the macintosh platform 
the company recently announced a new strategy with respect to updating its operating system while redesigning its plan for a next generation operating system 
to extend the life of its current operating system  the company intends to issue periodic releases consisting of discrete operating system components 
the company expects that this will enable it to introduce some new functionality for the current operating system sooner than it would be able to introduce a completely new operating system 
concurrently  the company will continue development of its next generation operating system  focusing on increased functionality at the possible expense of some backward compatibility 
diminished backward compatibility in its new operating system could result in a loss of existing customers 
inability to introduce a next generation operating system on a timely basis  or to gain developer support and market accepatance for it  may have an adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
as part of its efforts to increase the installed base for the macintosh platform  the company announced the licensing of the mac os to other personal computer vendors in january  as well as an additional licensing initiative in several vendors currently sell products that utilize the macintosh operating system 
the company believes that licensing the operating system will result in a broader installed base on which software vendors can develop and provide technical innovations for the macintosh platform 
however  there can be no assurance that the installed base will be broadened by the licensing of the operating system or that licensing will result in an increase in the number of application software titles or the rate at which vendors will bring to market application software based on the mac os 
in addition  as a result of licensing its operating system  the company is forced to compete with other companies producing mac os based computer systems 
the benefits to the company from licensing the mac os to third parties may be more than offset by the disadvantages of being required to compete with them 
as a supplemental means of addressing the competition from ms dos and windows  the company has devoted substantial resources toward developing personal computer products capable of running application software designed for the ms dos or windows operating systems cross platform products 
these products include the risc based powerpc trademark microprocessor and either include the pentium or class microprocessor or can accommodate an add on card containing a pentium or class microprocessor 
these products enable users to run concurrently applications that require the mac os  ms dos  windows  or windows operating systems 
depending on customer demand  the company may supply customers who purchase cross platform products with windows operating system software under licensing agreements with microsoft 
however  in order to do so  the company will need to enter into one or more agreements with certain microsoft distributors 
the company  international business machines corporation ibm and motorola  inc have agreed upon and announced the availability of specifications for a powerpc microprocessor based hardware reference platform 
these specifications define a unified personal computer architecture that gives access to both the power macintosh platform and the pc environment 
the company s future operating results and financial condition may be affected by its ability to continue to implement this agreement and to manage the risk associated with the transition to this new hardware reference platform 
decisions by customers to purchase the company s personal computers  as opposed to ms dos or windows based systems  are often based on the availability of third party software for particular applications 
the company believes that the availability of third party application software for the company s hardware products depends in part on third party developers perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing  maintaining  and upgrading such software for the company s products versus software for the larger ms dos and windows market 
this analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the company and its products  the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated  and the costs of developing such software products 
to the extent the company s recent financial losses and declining demand for the company s product have caused software developers to question the company s position in the personal computer market  developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the company s products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger ms dos and windows market 
microsoft corporation is an important developer of application software for the company s products 
accordingly  microsoft s interest in producing application software for the company s products may be influenced by microsoft s perception of its interests as the vendor of the windows operating systems 
the company s ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability of ibm and motorola  inc  the suppliers of the powerpc risc microprocessor for certain of the company s products  to supply to the company in adequate numbers microprocessors that produce superior price performance results compared with those supplied to the company s competitors by intel corporation  the developer and producer of the microprocessors used by most personal computers using the ms dos and windows operating systems 
ibm produces personal computers based on intel microprocessors as well as workstations based on the powerpc microprocessor  and is also the developer of os  a competing operating system to the company s mac os 
accordingly  ibm s interest in supplying the company with microprocessors for the company s products may be influenced by ibm s perception of its interests as a competing manufacturer of personal computers and as a competing operating system vendor 
several competitors of the company  including compaq  ibm  and microsoft  have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the company s key market segments  including education and publishing 
many of these companies have greater financial  marketing  manufacturing  and technological resources than the company 
the company is integrating internet capabilities into its new and existing hardware and software platforms 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to continue to do so successfully 
in addition  the internet market is rapidly evolving and is characterized by an increasing number of market entrants who have introduced or developed products addressing access to  authoring for  or communication over  the internet 
many of these competitors have a significant lead over the company in developing products for the internet  have significantly greater financial  marketing  manufacturing  and technological resources than the company  or both 
the company s future operating results and financial condition may also be affected by the company s ability to successfully expand and capitalize on its investments in other markets  such as the markets for messagepad registered trademark and related products 
global market risks a large portion of the company s revenue is derived from its international operations 
as a result  the company s operations and financial results could be significantly affected by international factors  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in the foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  the us dollar value of non us dollar based sales decreases 
when the non us dollar weakens  the us dollar value of us dollar based sales increases 
correspondingly  the us dollar value of us dollar based costs increases when the us dollar weakens and decreases when the us dollar strengthens 
overall  the company is a net receiver of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect the company s consolidated sales and gross margins as expressed in us dollars 
to mitigate the short term impact of fluctuating currency exchange rates on the company s non us dollar based sales  product procurement  and operating expenses  the company regularly hedges its non us dollar based exposures 
specifically  the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge firmly committed transactions 
currently  hedges of firmly committed transactions do not extend beyond one year 
the company also purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain other probable but not firmly committed transactions 
hedges of probable but not firmly committed transactions currently do not extend beyond one year 
to reduce the costs associated with these ongoing foreign exchange hedging programs  the company also regularly sells foreign exchange option contracts and enters into certain other foreign exchange transactions 
all foreign exchange forward and option contracts not accounted for as hedges  including all transactions intended to reduce the costs associated with the company s foreign exchange hedging programs  are carried at fair value and are adjusted on each balance sheet date for changes in exchange rates 
while the company is exposed with respect to fluctuations in the interest rates of many of the world s leading industrialized countries  the company s interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates 
in this regard  changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on the company s cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as well as interest paid on its notes payable to banks and long term debt 
to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in us interest rates  the company has entered into interest rate swap  collar  and floor transactions 
certain of these transactions are intended to better match the company s floating rate interest income on its cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments with the fixed rate interest expense on its long term debt 
the company also enters into these transactions in order to diversify a portion of the company s exposure away from fluctuations in short term us interest rates 
these instruments may extend the company s cash investment horizon up to a maximum duration of three years 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the company s foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions  as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios  the company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions  and its interest rate swap  option and floor positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures  respectively  from both an accounting and an economic perspective 
however  given the effective horizons of the company s risk management activities  there can be no assurance that the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect the company s operating results and financial position 
the company generally does not engage in leveraged hedging 
the company s current financial condition may have an impact on the costs of its hedging transactions  as well as the willingness of its financial counter parties to enter into hedging transactions with the company 
inventory and supply in line with the company s efforts to redesign its business model  the company is taking steps to streamline its product portfolios in its key usage areas in education  business  and the home 
this planned simplification of product lines has resulted in inventory reserves 
cancelation fees related to custom component inventory purchased for anticipated product introductions that have been canceled have also been paid or accrued 
the company has also separately provided for the estimated cost to correct certain quality problems in certain entry level  performa  powerbook  and peripheral products 
although the company believes its inventory and related reserves are adequate  no assurance can be given that the company will not incur additional inventory and related charges 
the company must order components for its products and build inventory well in advance of product shipments 
because the company s markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes  there is a risk that the company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
the company s operating results and financial condition have been and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the company s ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short term shifts in customer demand patterns 
certain of the company s products are manufactured in whole or in part by third party manufacturers  either pursuant to design specifications of the company or otherwise 
as a result of the company s restructuring actions  which include the sale of the company s fountain  colorado  manufacturing facility to sci systems  inc sci and a related manufacturing outsourcing agreement with sci  the proportion of the company s products produced and distributed under outsourcing arrangements will increase 
while outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations  they will also reduce the direct control the company has over production 
it is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured  or the flexibility of the company to respond to changing market conditions 
furthermore  any efforts by the company to manage its inventory under outsourcing arrangements could subject the company to liquidated damages or cancelation of the arrangement 
moreover  although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement  the company remains at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service 
accordingly  in the event of product defects or warranty liability  the company may remain primarily liable 
any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability  whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise  could adversely affect the company s future operating results and financial condition 
the company s ability to satisfy demand for its products may be limited by the availability of key components 
the company has experienced some limitations in supply of certain microprocessors in the first quarter of the company believes that the availability from suppliers to the personal computer industry of microprocessors and asics presents the most significant potential for constraining the company s ability to produce products 
specific microprocessors manufactured by ibm and motorola  inc are currently available only from single sources  while some advanced microprocessors are currently in the early stages of ramp up for production and thus have limited availability 
the company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for other semiconductor products with other industries that have experienced increased demand for such products  due to either increased consumer demand or increased use of semiconductors in their products such as the cellular phone and automotive industries 
finally  the company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry including certain microprocessors and asics 
continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the company s requirements 
such product supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could decrease the company s net sales and adversely affect the company s operating results and financial condition 
marketing and distribution a number of uncertainties may affect the marketing and distribution of the company s products 
currently  the company s primary means of distribution is through third party computer resellers 
such resellers include consumer channels such as mass merchandise stores  consumer electronics outlets  and computer superstores 
the company s business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened or if resellers within consumer channels were to decide not to continue to distribute the company s products 
uncertainty over demand for the company s products may cause resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the company s products 
under the company s arrangements with its resellers  resellers have the option to reduce or eliminate unfilled orders previously placed  in most instances without financial penalty 
resellers also have the option to return products to the company without penalty within certain limits  beyond which they may be assessed fees 
the company has recently experienced a reduction in ordering from historical levels by resellers due to uncertainty concerning the company s condition and prospects 
other factors the majority of the company s research and development activities  its corporate headquarters  and other critical business operations  including certain major vendors  are located near major seismic faults 
the company s operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake
