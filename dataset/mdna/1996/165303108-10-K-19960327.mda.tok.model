item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources the company s capital requirements reflect the capital intensive nature of its business and are attributable principally to its construction program and the retirement of its outstanding debt 
the company relies on cash generated from operations and short term borrowings to meet normal working capital requirements and to temporarily finance capital expenditures 
during  the company s net cash provided by operating activities  net cash used by investing activities and net cash used by financing activities were   and  respectively 
the board of directors has authorized the company to borrow up to  from various banks and trust companies 
as of december   the company had four unsecured bank lines of credit each in the amount of  funds provided from these lines of credit are used for short term cash needs to meet seasonal working capital requirements and to fund portions of its capital expenditures 
the outstanding balances of short term borrowings at december  and were  and  respectively 
based upon anticipated cash requirements in  the company may refinance the short term debt through the issuance of common equity  long term debt or a combination thereof 
the timing of such an issuance is dependent upon the nature of the securities involved as well as current market and economic conditions 
in and  the company s capital additions were funded by operating activities  unlike when funding was from operations and financing activities 
in  cash provided by operations increased due to the collection of a large amount of underrecovered purchased gas costs present at the end of during  and  capital expenditures were approximately   and  respectively 
for  the company has budgeted  for capital expenditures 
the breakdown of this amount is  for natural gas distribution   for natural gas transmission   for propane distribution   for information technology services and  for general plant 
the natural gas and propane distribution expenditures are for expansion and improvement of their existing service territories 
natural gas transmission expenditures are to improve the pipeline system by adding a compressor station in delaware city 
the information technology services expenditures are for computer hardware  software and related equipment 
financing for the construction program will be provided primarily using short term borrowings and cash from operations 
the construction program is subject to continuous review and modification 
actual construction expenditures may vary from the above estimates due to a number of factors including inflation  changing economic conditions  regulation  load growth  and the cost and availability of capital 
the company expects to incur environmental related expenditures in the future see note j to the consolidated financial statements  a portion of which may need to be financed through external sources 
management does not expect such financing to have a material adverse effect on the financial position or capital resources of the company 
capital structure as of december   common equity represented of permanent capitalization  compared to in and in the company remains committed to maintaining a sound capital structure and strong credit ratings in order to provide the financial flexibility needed to access the capital markets when required 
this commitment  along with adequate and timely rate relief for the company s regulated operations  helps to ensure that the company will be able to attract capital from outside sources at a reasonable cost 
the achievement of these objectives will provide benefits to customers and creditors  as well as to the company s investors 
financing activities on october   the company finalized a private placement of million of senior notes due in the company used the proceeds to retire  of the senior notes of eastern shore natural gas company  originally due october  the remaining proceeds of  were used to repay short term borrowing under the company s lines of credit 
the company issued no long term debt in during the first quarter of  the company issued  of senior notes due on february  the company used a portion of the funds to repay the short term borrowing balance outstanding 
in april  the company used the remaining funds  along with available short term borrowings  to repay  of the company s series h first mortgage bonds 
these bonds were originally due april  during the year  the company repaid a total of approximately  of long term debt  compared to  and  in and  respectively 
the company issued   and  shares of common stock in connection with its automatic dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan during the years of  and  respectively 
in  the company realized an increase in the number of shares issued from the plan due to an increase in the level of optional cash payments from existing stockholders  as well as the option made available in the fourth quarter of which allows employee stock purchases through payroll deductions 
the company began using treasury stock during the second half of to fund the monthly company matching contribution to the retirement savings plan 
in  and    and  shares  respectively  were used 
results of operations net income for was  an increase of  from s net income of  the net income reflects the settlement between eastern shore and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc regarding eastern shore s purchased gas adjustment pga computation 
this settlement  which is a non recurring event  contributed  to net income due to the reversal of the excess liability for a potential refund previously recorded  and resulted in a reduction in the required level of accruals from  after tax in to  after tax in exclusive of matters relating to the settlement and associated accruals  earnings increased by  net income for was  compared to  for earnings before interest and taxes ebit for the years  and were million  million and million  respectively 
natural gas distribution the natural gas distribution segment contributed ebit of million in each of and and million in the increase in ebit in from was due to a higher gross margin  offset by slightly higher operating expenses 
operating revenues increased by million in  after increasing by million in the cost of gas increased by million in  compared to a million increase in revenues for were higher by million due to the increased brokering of natural gas to large industrial customers  co generation facilities and local distribution companies located in the state of florida 
correspondingly  the cost of gas increased by million in connection with these activities 
overall  natural gas brokering and supply management services provided a minimal increase in gross margin in and also contributing to the higher revenue for was a million revenue increase from the florida distribution operations  slightly offset by a  reduction in revenues for the maryland distribution operations 
correspondingly  the cost of gas for increased by million for the florida distribution operations  somewhat offset by a  reduction in the cost of gas for the maryland distribution operations 
the gross margin for the florida distribution operations rose  in  primarily the result of and increases in transportation and delivery volumes  respectively 
these increases represented higher sales to phosphate producing and citrus processing customers and to three co generation plants 
gross margin also was higher in for distribution operations in the company s northern service territory due to increased deliveries resulting from temperatures being colder than the increases in revenues and the cost of gas are primarily due to the first full year of natural gas brokering operations  coupled with increased deliveries in the northern service territory to residential and commercial customers  resulting primarily from the timing and magnitude of colder weather in the first quarter of operating expenses for increased by million due to higher payroll  customer billing system conversion and operating costs  consulting fees  legal fees and regulatory expense 
maintenance expenses decreased slightly in after higher maintenance of meter and regulating stations in depreciation and amortization expense and other taxes increased due to plant additions placed in service in and operating expenses slightly decreased in due to a reduction in employee benefits  legal fees and regulatory expenses  somewhat offset by higher payroll and customer accounting expenses 
natural gas transmission the natural gas transmission operations contributed ebit of million for  compared to million in and million in included in the million increase in ebit for was the effect of the settlement between eastern shore and the ferc regarding eastern shore s pga computation see note k to the consolidated financial statements 
the settlement  which is a non recurring event  contributed million to ebit for due to the reversal of excess liability for a potential refund previously recorded  and resulted in a reduction in the required level of accruals from million in to  in exclusive of matters relating to the settlement and associated accruals  ebit increased  in  as compared to million in contributing to the increases in and ebit were increased gross margins primarily attributable to increased deliveries of industrial sales volumes  offset slightly by higher operating expenses 
operating revenues increased to million  from million in and million in  while the cost of gas decreased in to million  from million in after increasing to million in the increases in operating revenues in and of million and million  respectively  were primarily due to and increases in industrial sales volumes for the respective years 
revenues for were also higher due to an increase in contract demand levels effective november  the cost of gas decreased in due to the reversal of excess liability previously recorded and a reduction in the level of accruals recorded in as compared to for  the cost of gas increased due to the recording of the liability for the potential pga refund 
the majority of the increase in industrial sales volumes was due to a municipal power plant  and methanol plant  which chose to purchase natural gas from the company on an interruptible basis instead of alternative fuels 
the higher sales to those two customers contributed approximately million to gross margin in  an increase of million in gross margin over in  these same customers contributed approximately million to gross margin  an increase of  over the amount contributed to gross margin in these two customers are industrial interruptible customers and have no ongoing commitment  contractual or otherwise  to purchase natural gas from the company see note a to the consolidated financial statements 
operating expenses increased by  in after increasing only  in the majority of the increases were in payroll  telemetering and legal fees 
maintenance expenses decreased in by  after increasing in by  due to the painting of a pipeline bridge structure and a higher level of natural gas main maintenance in in connection with the ferc order  eastern shore applied in december of to the ferc for a blanket certificate authorizing open access transportation service on its pipeline system 
the implementation of open access transportation service  expected to occur during the second half of  will provide all of eastern shore s customers with the opportunity to transport gas over its system at ferc regulated rates 
open access is thus likely to result in a shift of eastern shore s business from margins earned on sales of gas to large industrial customers to a possibly lower margin earned on transportation services 
after the implementation of open access  it is expected the eastern shore s earnings  which this year and in the past have been driven to a substantial extent by widely varying levels of unregulated sales  will tend to resemble more of a fully regulated return 
the company believes that the impact on earnings can be partially offset by anticipated improvements to the pipeline system and  to a lesser extent  additional earnings from providing gas supply management services 
propane distribution the propane segment contributed ebit of million for  compared to ebit of million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in ebit  or  was the combined impact of a decrease in gross margin coupled with an increase in operating expenses 
the increase in ebit of  or  resulted from an increased gross margin  partially offset by higher operating expenses 
the decrease in gross margin for was primarily due to a decline in sales volume  partially offset by a higher average margin per gallon 
overall  temperatures in were colder than temperatures in  yet volumes were lower due to the timing and severity of weather conditions experienced in in addition  the average margin per gallon rose as the average selling price per gallon more than compensated for higher gas costs passed on by suppliers 
in  the segment did not secure a contract with one wholesale customer under which it had supplied large quantities of propane  contributing  to gross margin  in in  gross margin rose as a result of a increase in volumes and a increase in the average margin per gallon 
the timing and severity of the winter weather contributed to the volume growth  despite warmer overall temperatures for the year 
the increase in the average margin per gallon was the net effect of a lower average cost per gallon  partially offset by a lower average selling price per gallon 
operating expenses increased for both and  respectively 
comprising this increase for were higher payroll costs  employee benefit costs and outside services 
generating the increase in expenses for were higher costs in the following areas service and delivery salaries  vehicle fuel and maintenance costs directly related to the higher salaries and the severe winter  consulting costs and insurance claims 
partially offsetting these higher costs in were lower employee benefit costs 
information technology the information technology segment contributed ebit of  for  compared to ebit of  and  for and  respectively 
the substantial increase in ebit was due to higher earnings for both united systems  inc usi and capital data systems  inc 
cds 
the  increase in ebit was attributable to higher ebit for usi  partially offset by decreases in ebit for cds and currin associates  inc c a 
contributing to the increase in ebit were higher revenues and lower operating expenses 
usi revenues increased by million resulting from higher consulting and programming revenues  as well as the success of usi s new referral and placement service for progress technicians 
cds s revenues increased in due to non recurring revenue earned by providing services to its largest facilities management customer during a period of system conversion by this customer in connection with the termination of its contract 
lower operating expenses were the net result of reduced operating costs of  for cds  partially offset by higher operating costs of  for usi 
reductions in payroll  employee benefits  outside programming and maintenance costs comprised the majority of the overall decline in cds operating expenses 
the reductions resulted from downsizing efforts to transform cds from a product development and facilities management company  primarily billing on a fixed price basis  to a contract programming service company  billing on a time and materials basis  which is similar to usi 
starting in  the company will be reporting future results of cds and usi on a consolidated basis since cds is now directed by usi management 
these downsizing measures commenced at the same time cds contract with its largest facilities management customer was terminated  in connection with a change in control of that customer 
in conjunction with this termination  cds will no longer provide facilities management services for page it tm  the billing software product that it designed for the telecommunications industry 
in response to demand  revenues increased  therefore  associated payroll and employee benefit costs rose accordingly 
the increase in ebit of  or  was the net result of increased revenues and increased operating expenses 
as in  usi experienced higher consulting and programming revenues in in response to higher revenues of  usi s payroll and employee benefit costs also increased 
although cds recognized increased revenues of  in  its increase in operating expenses surpassed the higher revenues 
the increase in cds operating expenses of  resulted from the increased revenues and the completion of a major software development program 
included in the results for the years ended december   and were intersegment revenues of   and  respectively  which were eliminated in consolidations 
the intercompany lbit loss before interest and taxes connected with the development of utilicis tm totaled   and  for the years  and  respectively 
finally  in  the company disposed of its investment in c a due to declining revenues and business prospects 
c a s results reduced the segment s ebit by  and  for and  respectively 
other non operating income was approximately  in  compared to  in the increase was primarily due to a one time termination fee paid to cds by its largest facilities management customer in connection with a change in control of that customer  somewhat offset by costs to downsize cds to no longer provide facilities management service in connection with its page it software 
the decrease as compared to was due primarily to interest from upstream supplier refunds received in and the disposition of the company s investment in c a 
environmental matters the company continues to work with federal and state environmental agencies to assess the environmental impact and explore corrective action at several former gas manufacturing plant sites see note j to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that any future costs associated with these sites will be recoverable in rates 
competition historically  the company s natural gas operations have successfully competed with other forms of energy such as electric  oil and propane 
the principal considerations have been price and  to a lesser extent  accessibility 
since eastern shore has only recently elected to be an open access pipeline and this election will not be implemented until late  the company was not subject to the competitive pressures on the delmarva peninsula of ferc order no 
during starting in late  in connection with its open access status  eastern shore will shift from providing merchant services to providing storage and transportation services 
the company s distribution companies located in delaware and maryland will then face the possibility of the unbundling of their services to certain industrial customers  thus increasing competition 
the company has already addressed these issues in and in its florida distribution operation  when the company was required to unbundle its services to large industrial customers 
the company established a natural gas brokering and supply operation to compete for the services of these customers 
both the propane distribution and the information technology businesses face significant competition from a number of larger competitors with substantially greater resources available to them than the company 
in addition  in the information technology business  changes are occurring rapidly which could adversely impact the markets for the company s services 
inflation inflation impacts the prices the company must pay for labor and other goods and services required for operation  maintenance and capital improvements 
in recent years  however  the impact of inflation has lessened 
purchased gas costs  which have been relatively stable  are passed on to customers through the purchased gas adjustment clause in the company s tariffs 
to help cope with the effects of inflation on its capital investments and returns  the company seeks rate relief from its regulatory commissions for its regulated segments and constantly monitors the returns of its unregulated business segments 
cautionary statement statements made herein and elsewhere in this annual report which are not historical fact  are forward looking statements 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company is providing the following cautionary statement to identify important factors that could cause its actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in forward looking statements made herein or otherwise by or on behalf of the company 
a number of factors and uncertainties make it difficult to predict the effect on future operating results  relative to historical results  of eastern shore becoming an open access pipeline 
first  while open access is likely to diminish industrial interruptible sales margins  such sales have varied widely from year to year and  in future years  might make a less significant contribution to earnings even in the absence of open access 
second  the level of regulated transportation rates that will be in effect under open access has not yet been determined 
third  eastern shore has significant capital improvements scheduled in which will increase required revenue in a fully regulated environment 
fourth  there are a number of uncertainties  including the outcome of open access proceedings and the effects of competition  which will effect whether the company will be able to provide economical gas marketing services 
in addition  a number of factors and uncertainties affecting other aspects of the company s business could have a material impact on earnings 
these include seasonality and temperature sensitivity of our natural gas and propane businesses  the relative price of alternative energy sources and the effects of competition both on our unregulated businesses and on natural gas sales once the company operates in an open access environment
