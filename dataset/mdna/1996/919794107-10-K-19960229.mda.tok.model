the net interest margin decreased basis points to for compared to in the decrease in net interest margin was partially due to the upward movement in interest rates during this increase in rates caused depositors to shift funds from short term savings accounts to longer term certificates of deposit 
deposit rates increased faster than loan rates in and continued throughout  leading to a decline in the net interest margin during average interest earning assets increased million in  or over the amount 
this increase was mainly the result of increased volume of automobile loans  commercial mortgages and commercial loans 
average loans increased by million or over the amount 
the average rate on loans increased basis points  and combined with the increase in average loan volume  interest income on loans for increased by million over offsetting this increase  was a decline in average taxable investment securities of million or from the amount in the portfolio during average tax exempt investments remained almost unchanged during as compared to average interest bearing liabilities grew or million

non interest income the following table presents the components of non interest income for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands trust income service charges on deposit accounts    gains on securities transactions  net    fees from mortgage servicing    gains on sales of loans  other income    total    non interest income continues to represent a considerable source of income for valley 
excluding gains on securities transactions  total non interest income amounted to million in compared with million in service charges on deposit accounts increased thousand or from million in to million in a majority of this increase is due to the expansion of account volume and increased fees charged on deposit accounts 
fees from mortgage servicing increased by from million in to million in these fees represent gross servicing fees and related ancillary fees for servicing mortgage portfolios by vnb mortgage services  inc msi  vnb s mortgage servicing subsidiary  after eliminating in consolidation mortgage servicing fees earned by msi on loans serviced for vnb 
msi serviced a total of billion and billion of loans as of december  and  respectively  of which and million  respectively  are serviced for vnb 
the increase in the servicing portfolio was due to the acquisition of several portfolios totalling approximately million  the new origination of loans by vnb of million and the addition of loans from lakeland of approximately million  less principal paydowns and prepayments totaling million 
amortization expense on servicing rights increased during to million from million in  reflecting the increase in the size of the serviced portfolio 
an analysis is completed quarterly to determine amortization expense  based on all expected future cash flows 
gains on the sales of loans were thousand for compared to thousand for the gains recorded in are primarily from the sale of sba loans 
in valley stopped selling its newly originated residential mortgage loans in order to maintain its loan growth 
net gains on securities transactions in and amounted to million and million  respectively 
the gains recorded in were the result of the sale of securities due to rising interest rates beginning in early and valley s decision to take advantage of the increased yields available 
valley began offering investment banking services to middle market companies in through its recently chartered investment banking subsidiary  halidon hill co  which provides a full range of merger and acquisition advisory services  private placement of debt and equity  strategic planning services  and also offers advice to middle market firms with respect to management buyouts  capital formation strategies and recapitalizations 
operations began in the latter part of and had no material impact on the financial results of valley 
non interest expense the following table presents the components of non interest expense for the years ended december   and non interest expense years ended december  in thousands salary expense    employee benefit expense    fdic insurance premiums    net occupancy expense    furniture and equipment expense    amortization of intangible assets    other    total    non interest expense totalled million for  relatively unchanged from the level 
the largest component of non interest expense is salaries and employee benefit expense which totalled million in compared to million in at december   full time equivalent staff was  compared to  at the end of insurance premiums assessed by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic decreased by million  or to million in this reduction reflects the refund received from the fdic and the decrease in premium rate from to per hundred on bank insurance fund bif deposits 
it is expected that the savings insurance fund saif will be recapitalized during and that valley will be required to pay a one time special assessment 
after this payment  it is anticipated that future premiums on these deposits will also be reduced from to the legal minimum of  the one time payment to the fdic and the anticipated future reduction in premiums are based upon the legislative process for which valley has no control over the effective date or final payments or reduction of premiums 
see part i  item bif premiums and recapture of saif 
net occupancy expense increased to million in from million in the increase of thousand represents additional rent  utilities  tax and maintenance expense on facilities utilized by valley 
during the first quarter of valley acquired an  square foot building located across the street from its current administrative headquarters in wayne  new jersey in order to continue consolidating its operations 
renovations are currently being made to prepare the building for valley s use during amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of thousand or 
the majority of this decrease resulted from the reduction of amortization of core deposit intangibles  offset by an increase in amortization of purchased mortgage servicing rights totaling million during  compared with million for the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights sfas  which applies prospectively to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas amends sfas  accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
sfas requires that a mortgage banking enterprise recognize  as separate assets  rights to service mortgage loans  however those servicing rights are acquired 
sfas eliminates the previously existing accounting distinction between servicing rights acquired through purchase transactions and those acquired through loan originations 
sfas also requires that a mortgage banking entity assess its capitalized mortgage servicing rights msrs periodically for impairment  based on the fair value of those rights 
valley has determined that there will be no material impact expected on the financial position or results of operations of valley as a result of adopting this statement prospectively during other expenses were million in compared to million in advertising and marketing expense increased thousand to million  data processing expense increased thousand to million  other real estate owned expense decreased thousand to million  stationary expense increased thousand to million  postage and delivery expense increased thousand to million  legal expense increased thousand to million  and telecommunication expense increased thousand to million 
the efficiency ratio measures a bank s gross operating expense as a percentage of fully taxable equivalent net interest income and other non interest income without taking into account security gains and losses and other non recurring items 
valley s efficiency ratio as of december  is  one of the lowest in the industry  compared with an efficiency ratio for and of and  respectively 
valley strives to control its efficiency ratio and expenses as a means of producing increased earnings for its shareholders 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  which is effective beginning in sfas allows companies either to continue to account for stock based employee compensation plans under existing accounting standards or adopt a fair value based method of accounting as defined in the new standard 
valley will continue to follow the existing accounting standards for these plans 
as a result  the new standard is not expected to have an impact on valley 
income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax income increased to in compared to in this increase was attributable to a decrease in tax exempt interest income and an increase in state tax expense 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  was issued by the financial accounting standards board in february valley adopted sfas no 
prospectively as of january  the cumulative effect of this change in accounting for income taxes reduced net income by thousand and is reported separately in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  asset liability management interest rate sensitivity the following table illustrates valley s interest rate gap position as of december  on a day  between and days and after day basis 
interest rate sensitivity analysis non interest rate repricing sensitive after total or repricing but repricing repricing within within within after days days days days total in thousands earning assets federal funds sold    investments held to maturity      investments available for sale    loans      total earning assets      percentage of total earning assets sources of funds non interest bearing deposits     savings deposits     time deposits      federal funds purchased and securities sold under repurchase agreements    other short term borrowings    other borrowings     non interest bearing sources   total sources of funds      percentage of total sources of funds interest sensitivity gap     cumulative interest sensitivity gap    ratio of earning assets to sources of funds 

cumulative ratio of earning assets to sources of funds managing net interest margin continues to be one of the most important factors in maximizing earnings 
through its asset liability policy  valley strives to maintain a consistent net interest rate differential by managing the sensitivity and repricing of its assets and liabilities to interest rate fluctuations 
valley seeks to achieve a sufficient level of rate sensitive assets to equal its rate sensitive liabilities  and analyzes the maturity and repricing of earning assets and sources of funds at various intervals 
the level by which repricing earning assets exceed or are exceeded by repricing sources of funds is expressed as a ratio and dollar value interest sensitivity gap and is used as a measure of interest rate risk 
at december   rate sensitive assets exceeded rate sensitive liabilities at the day interval and resulted in a positive gap of million or a ratio of rate sensitive liabilities exceeded rate sensitive assets at the to day interval by million or a ratio of 
and resulted in a negative gap 
the total positive gap repricing within days as of december  is million or management does not view these amounts as presenting an unusually high risk potential  although no assurances can be given that valley is not at risk from rate increases or decreases 
the above gap results take into account repricing and maturities of assets and liabilities  but fail to consider the interest rate sensitivities of those asset and liability accounts 
management has prepared for its use an income simulation model to project future net interest income streams in light of the current gap position 
management has also prepared for its use alternative scenarios to measure levels of net interest income associated with various changes in interest rates 
according to this computer model  an interest rate increase of basis points and a decrease of basis points resulted in an impact on future net interest income which is consistent with target levels contained in valley s asset liability policy 
management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on valley s net interest income 
liquidity liquidity measures the ability to satisfy current and future cash flow needs as they become due 
maintaining a level of liquid funds through asset liability management seeks to ensure that these needs are met at a reasonable cost 
on the asset side  liquid funds are maintained in the form of cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  investments securities held to maturity maturing within one year  securities available for sale and loans held for sale 
at december   liquid assets amounted to billion  as compared to million at december  this represents and of earning assets  and and of total assets at december  and year end  respectively 
on the liability side  the primary source of funds available to meet liquidity needs is valley s core deposit base  which generally excludes certificates of deposit over thousand 
core deposits averaged approximately billion and billion at december  and year end  respectively  representing and of average earning assets 
short term borrowings and large dollar certificates of deposit  generally those over thousand  are used as supplemental funding sources during periods when growth in the core deposit base does not keep pace with that of earning assets 
additional liquidity is derived from scheduled loan and investment payments of principal and interest  as well as prepayments received 
proceeds from the sales of investment securities available for sale were million  and proceeds of million were generated from investment maturities 
purchases of investment securities were million 
short term borrowings and certificates of deposit over thousand amounted to million and million  on average  for the year ending december  and  respectively 
lakeland had advances outstanding with the federal home loan bank of new york fhlb which were assigned to vnb as part of the merger 
during early  vnb was approved as a member of the fhlb 
vnb intends to utilize borrowings from the fhlb as a source of funds for its asset growth and asset liability management 
these advances are collateralized by pledges of fhlb stock and a blanket assignment of qualifying mortgage loans 
as of december   valley had outstanding advances of million 
the following table lists  by maturity  all certificates of deposit of  and over at december  these certificates of deposit are generated primarily from core deposit customers and are not brokered funds 
in thousands less than three months  three to six months  six to twelve months  more than twelve months  valley s cash requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders 
this cash need is routinely satisfied by dividends collected from its subsidiary bank 
projected cash flows from this source are expected to be adequate to pay dividends  given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of its subsidiary

excludes equity securities which have indefinite maturities 
valley s investment portfolio is comprised of us government and federal agency securities  tax exempt issues of states and municipalities  mortgage backed securities and equity and other securities 
there were no securities in the name of any one issuer exceeding of shareholders equity  except for securities issued by the united states and its political subdivisions and agencies 
the portfolio generates substantial interest income which serves as a source of liquidity 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of long and short term economic and financial conditions  including the interest rate environment and other statement of financial condition components 
as of december  valley has billion of securities available for sale compared with million at december  those securities are recorded at their fair value on an aggregate basis 
if the aggregate fair value of these securities should decline below cost  then the value would be written down to market 
as of december  the investment securities available for sale had an unrealized gain of million  net of deferred taxes  compared to an unrealized loss of million  net of deferred taxes  at december  this change was primarily due to an increase in prices  resulting from a decreasing interest rate environment 
these securities are not considered trading account securities  which may be sold on a continuous basis  but rather securities which may be sold to meet the various liquidity and interest rate requirements of valley 
pursuant to the provisions and implementation guidance contained within the special report a guide to implementation of statement on accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  on december  valley reassessed the classification of all securities within its portfolio and transferred million from its held to maturity investment portfolio to its available for sale portfolio 
these securities had a market value of million which resulted in valley recording an unrealized gain on securities available for sale  net of tax  within shareholders equity of million 
loan portfolio the following table reflects the composition of the loan portfolio for the five years ended december  loan portfolio in thousands commercial      construction      commercial mortgage      residential mortgage      installment      less unearned income     total loans      the composition of valley s loan portfolio continues to change due to the local economy and loan demand 
commercial lending increased by the largest percentage during both and  and installment loans and commercial mortgage loans have continued their steady increase 
residential loans increased steadily throughout  but slowed considerably as interest rates began to rise in the increase in installment loans is reflective of valley s increased market penetration in automobile lending 
there is no guarantee that the level of lending will continue at this brisk pace during residential mortgage loans represent of the loan portfolio 
installment loans  including predominantly automobile and credit card loans  totalled million at december   increasing by million over or and representing of the loan portfolio 
commercial mortgages increased or million from december to december  and commercial loans increased or million from december to december valley has continued to offer various types of fixed rate residential mortgage loans and is also offering a large array of adjustable rate loans 
during valley periodically sold some of its year fixed rate loans into the secondary market  allowing valley to keep its portfolio mixed between fixed rate and variable rate loans  as well as maintaining a shorter maturity of its portfolio 
beginning in and continuing into valley decided to keep its residential mortgage loans being originated so that the portfolio could grow as demand by valley for loans increased 
installment loans outstanding at year end include automobile loans referred to vnb by a major insurance company  which are subject to valley s underwriting criteria 
approximately of the automobile loan portfolio and of the total loan portfolio outstanding at december  represent loans originated by vnb through this referral program 
over the last several years the amount of loans referred through this program has grown 
vnb intends to extend this program  as all approvals were received in late to establish a finance company in toronto  canada 
the new finance company will make consumer loans  primarily auto loans  in several provinces in canada 
vnb anticipates that the canadian finance company will become operational in the first quarter of vnb is a credit card issuer and has initiated several successful affinity programs during and  primarily with local municipalities in new jersey 
in late  vnb signed a letter of intent with a proposed partner for a substantial co branding credit card program 
vnb anticipates this program  if it occurs  could add a significant number of credit card accounts to vnb within two years 
the program is subject to the execution of a definitive agreement and if the parties reach a definitive agreement  vnb anticipates this program will begin in the second quarter of management can offer no assurance that vnb and its proposed partner will enter into a definitive agreement 
much of valley s lending is in northern new jersey 
however  efforts are made to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan to guard against a downward turn in any one economic sector 
there were no loan concentrations at december  other than those disclosed above

a rollover of the loan at maturity may require a principal paydown 
as part of the acquisition of rock bank during  vnb became a preferred small business administration sba lender with authority to make loans without the prior approval of the sba 
approximately of each loan is guaranteed by the sba and may be sold into the secondary market  with the balance retained in vnb s portfolio 
vnb intends to expand this area of lending as it provides a solid source of fee income and loans with floating interest rates tied to the prime lending rate 
during  vnb originated approximately million of sba loans and sold million 
at december   million of sba loans were held in vnb s portfolio and vnb serviced approximately million of sba loans at december  it is not known if the trend of increased lending will continue 
vnb continues to take advantage of loan demand in those sectors of the economy where it is most prevalent 
non performing assets non performing assets include non accrual loans and other real estate owned oreo 
loans are generally placed on a non accrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal or interest 
exceptions to the non accrual policy may be permitted if the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection 
oreo is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate 
oreo is reported at the lower of cost or fair value at the time of acquisition and at the lower of fair value  less estimated costs to sell  or cost thereafter 
non performing assets continued to decrease  and totalled million at december  compared with million at december   a decrease of million  or

a separate credit department is responsible for risk assessment  credit file maintenance and periodically evaluating overall creditworthiness of a borrower 
additionally  efforts are made to limit concentrations of credit within the loan portfolio so as to minimize the impact of a downturn in any one economic sector 
valley s portfolio  in total  is diversified as to type of borrower and loan 
most of valley s portfolio is in northern new jersey  presenting a geographical and credit risk if there were a significant downturn of the economy within new jersey 
management realizes that some degree of risk must be expected in the normal course of lending activities 
reserves are maintained to absorb such potential loan and off balance sheet credit losses 
the allowance for loan losses and related provision are an expression of management s evaluation of the credit portfolio and economic climate 
the following table sets forth the relationship among loans  loans charged off and loan recoveries  the provision for loan losses and the allowance for loan losses for the past five years years ended december  in thousands average loans outstanding      beginning balance allowance for loan losses      balance from acquisition  loans charged off commercial      construction  mortgage commercial   mortgage residential installment      charge off loans recovered commercial  construction mortgage commercial mortgage residential installment  net charge offs      provision charged to operations      ending balance allowance for loan losses      ratio of net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period 




the allowance for possible loan losses is maintained at a level necessary to absorb potential loan losses and other credit risk related charge offs 
it is the result of an analysis which relates outstanding balances to expected reserve levels required to absorb future credit losses 
current economic problems are addressed through management s assessment of anticipated changes in the regional economic climate  changes in composition and volume of the loan portfolio and variances in levels of classified loans  non performing assets and other past due amounts 
additional factors include consideration of exposure to loss including size of credit  existence and nature of collateral  credit record  profitability and general economic conditions 
during the year  continued emphasis was placed on the current economic climate and the condition of the real estate market in the northern new jersey area 
management addressed these current economic conditions and applied that information to changes in the composition of the loan portfolio 
the decline in non performing assets  coupled with the continued recovery of the economy  among other things  was responsible for the decision to decrease the provision from million in to million in the following table summarizes the allocation of the allowance for loan losses to specific loan categories for the past five years years ended december  percent percent percent percent percent of loan of loan of loan of loan of loan category category category category category allowance to total allowance to total allowance to total allowance to total allowance to total allocation loans allocation loans allocation loans allocation loans allocation loans in thousands loan category commercial      real estate      consumer      unallocated  n a  n a  n a  n a  n a at december  the allowance for loan losses amounted to million or of loans  net of unearned income  as compared to million or at year end the allowance is adjusted by provisions charged against income and loans charged off  net of recoveries 
net loan charge offs were million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  charge offs from the lakeland merger added approximately million to total net charge offs during the ratio of net charge offs to average loans amounted to for compared with for although substantially all risk elements at december  have been disclosed in the categories presented above  management believes that the current economic conditions may affect the ability of certain borrowers to comply with the contractual repayment terms on certain real estate and commercial loans 
as part of the analysis of the loan portfolio by management  it has been determined that there are approximately million in potential problem loans at december  which have not been classified as non accrual  past due or restructured 
potential problem loans are defined as performing loans for which management has serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which may result in a nonperforming loan 
approximately million has been provided for in the allowance for loan losses for these potential problem loans 
there can be no assurance that valley has identified all of its problem loans 
at december   valley had identified approximately million of problem loans 
in may of  fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosure which applies to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  these statements require that impaired loans be measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  at the loan s observable market price or at the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
there was no material impact on the financial position or results of operations as a result of valley adopting these statements during capital adequacy a significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its shareholders equity  which should expand in close proportion to asset growth 
at december   shareholders equity totalled million or of total assets  compared with million or at year end valley has achieved steady internal capital generation throughout the past five years 
risk based guidelines define a two tier capital framework 
tier capital consists of common shareholders equity less disallowed intangibles  while total risk based capital consists of tier capital and the allowance for loan losses up to of risk adjusted assets 
risk adjusted assets are determined by assigning various levels of risk to different categories of assets and off balance sheet activities 
the following table details valley s capital components and ratios as of december   and capital analysis in thousands total shareholders equity excluding fair value adjustment    less disallowed intangible assets    tier capital    allowance for loan losses    total risk based capital    risk adjusted assets    adjusted average assets    during  the regulatory agencies determined that the fasb fair value adjustment does not enter into the calculation of capital ratios

the comparable ratios at december  were for tier capital and for total risk based capital 
valley s ratios at december  are above the well capitalized requirements  which require tier i capital of at least and total risk based capital of 
the federal reserve board requires well capitalized bank holding companies to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of 
at december  and  valley was in compliance with the leverage requirement having a tier leverage ratio of and  respectively 
the primary source of capital growth is through retention of earnings 
valley s rate of earnings retention  derived by dividing undistributed earnings by net income  was at december   compared to at december  cash dividends declared amounted to 
per share  equivalent to a dividend payout ratio of  up from the for the year the current quarterly dividend rate of 
per share provides for an annual rate of per share 
valley s board of directors continues to believe that cash dividends are an important component of shareholder value and that at its current level of performance and capital  valley expects to continue its current dividend policy of a quarterly distribution of earnings to its shareholders

net interest income on a tax equivalent basis rose million  or to million in the increase in was due primarily to the movement of funds from taxable investments to higher yielding interest earning loans 
average loan balances increased million  earning an average rate of  while taxable investments which earned an average of  decreased million 
the net interest margin remained unchanged for at compared to for the provision for loan losses totaled million in compared with million in the decline in nonperforming assets coupled with the continued recovery of the economy among other things was responsible for the decrease
