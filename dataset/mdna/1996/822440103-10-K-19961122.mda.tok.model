item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general sheldahl is a leading producer of advanced laminate materials and materials based components  primarily for sale to the automotive electronics and datacommunications markets 
the company s basic materials technology was originally developed for the united states space program 
in  the company developed a business strategy focused on achieving a leading position supplying the automotive electronics market with flexible interconnects based on the company s core materials technologies 
management believed the automotive market provided growth opportunities due to increasing electronic content of automobiles as manufacturers focused on enhancing vehicle performance while reducing weight and overall vehicle costs 
the company targets specific automotive customers that it has identified as leaders in the drive to increase the electronic content of automobiles 
as a result of this business strategy  the company s sales to automotive customers increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  a compound annual growth rate of  while the company s sales to other markets declined from million in fiscal to million in fiscal concurrent with the company s strategic shift to focus on the automotive electronics market in  sheldahl began to focus its research and development expenditures on new opportunities 
as a result  in the company patented its novaclad high performance adhesiveless flexible laminate 
the features of novaclad allow circuitry designers to increase circuit density for integrated circuit ic packaging and other interconnect solutions 
the company also developed viagrid  a higher value form of novaclad with pre drilled small holes that allow printed circuit manufacturers to produce flexible interconnects that are up to six times more dense than current technology 
the company also uses viagrid in the manufacture of chip carrier substrates primarily for ic packages 
in fiscal  a consortium was organized by the advanced research projects agency arpa of the us department of commerce to develop a high density  low cost multichip module utilizing novaclad as the substrate material 
the arpa consortium  comprised of a vertically integrated team of non competing companies  has achieved various milestones  including validation of each of the essential processes for production of the company s chip carrier substrates as the base material for low cost multichip modules 
in june  with the assistance of funding from arpa  the company established a prototype production facility  and late in calendar year  began construction of its new manufacturing facility in longmont  colorado  for the production of novaclad  viagrid and chip carrier substrates micro products in commercial quantities 
the company expected commercial production to begin at the longmont facility by april however  a variety of factors  including equipment delivery delays  product specification changes  and supporting process issues  resulted in a nine month delay in the full production ramp up  which is now expected to commence in the second quarter of fiscal during the delay  the company has been working with leading customers  including texas instruments  asat  inc and motorola  in production validation and product acceptance 
the adverse financial impact of the production delay at the micro products facility  combined with the resulting need to continue operation of the prototype facility  has been and will continue to be significant 
net of arpa consortium funding  the expenses of the company s micro products facility totaled million in fiscal once fully operational  projected expenses  including depreciation  are expected to approach million per quarter 
therefore  volume production and the related sales revenue upon successful customer acceptance will be essential to reduce the impact of the ongoing operating costs of the company s micro products division 
in total  the company used arpa consortium funding to offset expenses of million  million  and million in fiscal years   and  respectively 
based on remaining milestones  additional funding assistance from the arpa consortium and another consortium related to low cost plastic packaging and flip chips is expected to total approximately  through august the company expects to continue to make substantial investments in production capabilities to support its strategy of increasing penetration of the automotive electronics market and commercializing its emerging novaclad  viagrid and chip carrier substrate products for the datacommunications market 
during fiscal years   and  the company made capital expenditures of approximately million to increase the production capabilities of its current operations 
through fiscal  the company made capital expenditures exceeding million in connection with the micro products production and pilot facilities 
the company has capitalized expenditures related to building  equipping and financing the new production facility  however  costs to operate the pilot facility  net of the arpa consortium funding  have been charged to operations as incurred 
on september   the company sold its aviation lighting product line to the bfgoodrich company for approximately million  enabling the company to focus on its emerging products  flexible interconnects and flexible laminates operations 
the aviation lighting product line generated sales of million in fiscal year and was insignificant to the overall operations of the company
