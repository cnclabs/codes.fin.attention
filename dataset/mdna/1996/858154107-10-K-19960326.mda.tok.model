the total borrowing capacity under the revolving credit line is governed by a formula based on levels of accounts receivable and inventory 
cash provided from operations approximated million  million and million during each of the three years ended december    and  respectively 
during this same time period  average annual borrowings against the revolving line of credit have been less than million and at december   the company had million of the revolving credit line available for borrowing

management has no reason to believe that internally generated cash flow  together with borrowings under its capital expenditure line and revolving credit line  will not be sufficient to meet the company s ongoing liquidity needs 
other discretionary capital spending and strategic acquisitions  if any  would also place demands on the company s longer term liquidity position 
such expenditures and acquisitions would be subject to availability of funds and approval by the company s board of directors
