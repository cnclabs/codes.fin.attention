additionally  the credit agreement contains certain customary affirmative and negative covenants which require the company to maintain certain financial ratios  and  among other things  restrict i declaration or payment of dividends  ii the incurrence of any additional indebtedness  iii capital expenditures and iv aggregated lease payments 
as a result of the budgetary constraints of certain of the company s clients and consequent reduced shipments to such clients discussed above  the company can give no assurance that net revenues and shipments to these clients will resume at historical levels while it seeks to diversify its client base 
however  the company believes that through the implementation of its cost reduction program  including the consolidation of its manufacturing facilities  the effect of the foster grant supply contract  its current cash and cash equivalents  its backlog  anticipated future cash flows from operations  continued management of working capital requirements and availability under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to support its debt service requirements and its other capital and operating needs 
however  there can be no assurance that such belief will prove to be correct  that additional financing will not be required  or that any such financing will be available on commercially reasonable terms or otherwise
