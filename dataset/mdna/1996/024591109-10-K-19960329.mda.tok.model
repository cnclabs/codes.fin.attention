in  congoleum was accounted for on the equity in earnings of joint venture line 
on a pro forma basis  combining the net earnings effect between years  the contribution to earnings from abi  congoleum and k m were lower than due to a combination of factors which include a weak economy  raw material inflation  competitive pricing and a sluggish retail environment 
abi canada did not contribute to earnings in and k m posted a loss 
pretax earnings of abi of million in were million higher than pretax earnings of million 
key factors accounting for the improvement from to were major increases in sales volume in both the tape division and ideal tape division due mainly to an improvement in the domestic economy  with abi canada being only slightly ahead of earnings from operations in particularly benefited from a major restructuring and reorganization at the ideal tape division which returned to reasonable profit levels after three years of small losses 
net sales increased in to million from million in due mainly to the inclusion of congoleum sales of million and k m sales of million 
abi canada and tape division sales are slightly ahead of s level and  on a pro forma basis  congoleum sales are slightly lower than last year due to weak retail demand  particularly for higher priced residential products  and reduced purchases by a major customer 
partially offsetting these decreases were sales of new products and increased sales to the manufactured housing segment 
net sales increased in to million from million in excluding amtico sales from  sales of ongoing operations in increased by million or over all divisions of abi experienced sales increases in compared to interest income increased to million in from 
million in interest income at congoleum amounted to million in other revenue increased to million in from million in  primarily due to the inclusion in of congoleum and k m 
the most significant item in other revenue is million royalty income earned at congoleum  which is comparable to the amount of royalty income earned by congoleum in other revenue in increased to million compared to  primarily due to abi receiving profit distributions of 
million from k m 
insurance recoveries and foreign exchange gains made up the balance of the increase from cost of products sold in was of net sales and compares favorably with in historically  gross margins at congoleum and k m are higher than those for the rest of abi and did influence the improvement in gross margins for in at congoleum  costs were higher than due to sharply higher raw material costs 
at k m in  costs were also higher than due to product mix changes 
cost of products sold in was of net sales and is equivalent to the in major improvements at the ideal tape division resulting from a plan of restructuring and reorganization  offset increased costs at the tape division from capacity related manufacturing constraints that were relieved in the fourth quarter due to the completion of an expansion program 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to of net sales in from in the reason for this increase is the impact of expenses at k m where these expenses historically have been over of net sales due to the retail nature of their business 
excluding k m from the calculation  these percentages would be lower than last year 
at both abi and congoleum  this expense on a pro forma basis is lower in actual dollars due to management control of operating expenses in light of lower profitability in at congoleum  this lower spending level more than offset a million charge to bad debt expense related to the bankruptcy filing of a major retailer 
selling  general  and administrative expense in amounted to of net sales compared to in absolute dollars were lower than in that included two months of amtico flooring division expenses 
the previously discussed reorganization and restructuring at the ideal tape division also resulted in reduced spending levels in this expense category 
the effective tax rate in was  in it was  and in it was 
the primary reasons for the increase in the effective tax rate in are the consolidation of congoleum  whose effective tax rate is  and the effect of providing deferred taxes on undistributed domestic earnings 
in  at all abi and congoleum operations  raw material price inflation resulted in a decline in gross profit margins due to the inability to completely pass on to its customers these cost increases in the form of higher selling prices 
the effects of movement in foreign currency exchange rates were not significant during because abi s foreign operations are limited and conducted in countries that historically have had stable currencies and low inflation  abi believes movements of foreign currency exchange rates in the future would not significantly affect its results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources at december   consolidated working capital was million  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to  and the debt to equity ratio was to influencing the debt to equity ratio is million of congoleum debt which has no recourse to abi 
net cash provided by operations during was million  generated mainly from net earnings and depreciation partially offset by increases in inventories due mainly to anticipated improvement in sales levels and a reduction in payables and accruals which is primarily due to the settlement of certain liabilities acquired in the k m transaction 
capital expenditures for are estimated to be in the range of million 
capital expenditures cover normal replacement of machinery and equipment and process improvement purposes  and at abi s moorestown plant  a continuation of an expansion program that began in depreciation and amortization expense is forecast at million 
abi has recorded what it believes are adequate provisions for environmental remediation and product related liabilities  including provisions for testing for potential remediation of conditions at its own facilities 
while abi believes its estimate of the future amount of these liabilities is reasonable and that they will be paid over a period of five to ten years  the timing and amount of such payments may differ significantly from abi s assumptions 
although the effect of future government regulation could have a significant effect on abi s costs  abi is not aware of any pending legislation which could significantly affect the liabilities abi has established for these matters 
there can be no assurances that the costs of any future government regulations could be passed along to its customers 
certain legal and administrative claims are pending or have been asserted against abi  which are considered incidental to its business 
among these claims  abi is a named party in several actions associated with waste disposal sites and asbestos related claims 
these actions include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of wastes deposited at various sites  including superfund sites 
the exact amount of such future costs to abi is indeterminable due to such unknown factors as the magnitude of clean up costs  the timing and extent of the remedial actions that may be required  the determination of abi s liability in proportion to other potentially responsible parties and the extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance 
abi has recorded provisions in its financial statements for the estimated probable loss associated with all known environmental and asbestos related contingencies 
the contingencies also include claims for personal injury and or property damage 
abi records a liability for environmental remediation and asbestos related claim costs when a clean up program or claim payment becomes probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
as assessments and clean ups progress  these liabilities are adjusted based upon progress in determining the timing and extent of remedial actions and the related costs and damages 
the extent and amounts of the liabilities can change substantially due to factors such as the nature or extent of contamination  changes in remedial requirements and technological improvements 
estimated insurance recoveries related to these liabilities are reflected in other noncurrent assets 
abi has recorded its estimate of loss associated with the foregoing claims  however  the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot presently be determined and could possibly be material to the results of operations or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual reporting period 
cash requirements for capital expenditures  working capital  debt service  equity investments in k m and the current authorization of million to purchase abi common stock  are expected to be financed from operating activities and borrowings under existing lines of credit which at abi are presently million and at congoleum are million
