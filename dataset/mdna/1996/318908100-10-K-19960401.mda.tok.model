these increases  are attributable to the increases in premiums written due to an expansion of first central insurance s markets 
net premium written decreased or approximately  in when compared to ceded premiums increased or approximately  in when compared to due to a change in the company s reinsurance treaty as of april  the endorsement to the reinsurance treaty changed the calculation of reinsurance premium from a percentage of earned premiums to a percentage of written premiums although reinsurance premiums will continue to be paid when earned 
the effect of this endorsement is a change in the manner by which the company accounts for reinsurance ceded resulting in a decrease in net premiums written and a decrease in unearned premiums 
the endorsement also produces a liability  funds held for reinsurance treaty of  at december  net investment income  realized gains during first central insurance  in an effort to upgrade its investment portfolio  sold approximately  of preferred stock and corporate notes and purchased government securities  therefore showing an increase in interest received on government securities while a decrease in corporate bond interest and dividends on preferred stock

gaap and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
require the portion of the unrealized loss of an individual security to be recognized as a realized loss in the accounting period when the holder determines that such portion of the decline in the market value is other than temporary 
temporary declines in the market value of first central s debt securities held to maturity do not affect first central s carrying value of such securities  since first central has the ability and the intent to hold these investments to maturity  at which time their full face value is expected to be received at no loss to first central 
temporary fluctuations in the market value of available for sale securities are reflected in shareholders equity as unrealized appreciation or depreciation net of applicable deferred federal income taxes  however  any decline in the value of the security below its cost considered to be other than temporary is reflected as a realized loss in first central s income statement 
once an investment is written down to reflect an other than temporary decline  the writedown  which is charged against operations  establishes a new cost basis for the security 
during  one security was deemed to have a decline in market value other than temporary 
as a result of a recent public announcement stating that discovery zone inc filed for chapter bankruptcy protection  first central insurance wrote down the cost of the discovery zone inc subordinated notes due held in first central insurance s investment portfolio

these factors may fluctuate from year to year  and not necessarily in any relationship to the amount of premiums written or earned 
first central insurance periodically reviews its programs and reevaluates classes of insurance which it writes 
as claims are incurred  provisions are made for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  less related reinsurance by accumulating individual case estimates for losses reported prior to the close of an accounting period  estimating unreported losses based upon past experience modified for current trends  and estimating expenses for investigating and adjusting claims based upon past experience 
such liabilities are necessarily subject to the impact of future changes in claims severity 
notwithstanding the variability inherent in such estimates  first central insurance s management believes that the provisions made for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are adequate 
such estimates are continually reviewed  and as adjustments thereto become necessary  such adjustments are reflected in current operations 
as of september  first central insurance retained an actuarial firm  stergiou and gruber risk consultants  on a retainer  which reviews first central insurance s reserves quarterly and is available on a daily basis for consultation 
estimated salvage and subrogation recoveries are recorded after considering the effect of payments to reinsurers based on management s estimate of the future recoveries applicable to claims incurred prior to december in incurred losses increased by when compared to this increase was due primarily to an approximate  increase in incurred but not reported ibnr reserves and approximately  increase in paid losses during the year when compared to during  an extensive review of the company s loss reserves was conducted by the company s independent actuary 
as a result of this review ibnr reserves were increased  in the fourth quarter of for a total annual increase of approximately  in and incurred losses increased by and  respectively  when compared to the previous year 
the increase in incurred losses was attributable to the strengthening of the case and ibnr reserves and due to increases in premiums written 
in incurred loss adjustment expenses increased over the corresponding period in this increase was due primarily to an increase in paid loss adjustment expenses 
in incurred loss adjustment expenses increased by  in comparison to this increase was due to an increase in paid allocated and unallocated loss adjustment expenses 
first central insurance s loss ratio on its commercial multiple peril line of insurance increased to in compared to in and in the increased loss ratio in the year was due primarily to approximately  increase in ibnr reserves when compared to in first central s loss ratio on its workers compensation line of business increased to in primarily due to approximately  increase in ibnr reserves when compared to in  first central insurance s loss ratio on its workers compensation line of business decreased to compared to in this decrease was due to less losses incurred and an increase in premiums earned 
in  and  first central insurance s loss ratio on its general liability line of insurance increased in comparison to its prior year s loss ratio  the ratio of  ratio of and the ratio of 
the loss ratio in increased primarily due to an increase in ibnr reserves of approximately  when compared to first central insurance s loss ratio on its automobile liability line of insurance increased to in from in and in  primarily due to the private passenger portion of the automobile liability line of business 
due to the historically increasing loss ratios on private passenger automobile liability insurance  first central insurance reviews this line and limits writings to the amount necessary to satisfy state insurance regulations 
additionally  first central insurance received permission from nys insurance department to increase rates on private passenger automobile liability insurance which was implemented in december in  first central insurance s loss ratio on automobile physical damage line of business decreased to when compared to in and in due to the continuing review and limitation of writings on this line of business 
first central insurance has implemented restrictive guidelines in respect of the underwriting of this line of business 
underwriting expenses and underwriting expense ratio underwriting expenses are a combination of policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses as shown on the statement of income 
in first central s underwriting expenses decreased when compared to this was a result of first central insurance s policy acquisition costs decreasing and other operating expenses decreasing when compared to the same period in the decrease in underwriting expenses was primarily due to an increase in ceded commissions and a decrease in rent offset by increases in commissions  premium taxes  real estate expenses  payroll and depreciation 
in first central s underwriting expense increased by over such expenses for while the underwriting expense ratio decreased from in to in the underwriting expenses in exceeded prior year amounts primarily due to additional premium tax expenses incurred and additional employee staffing  both as a result of an increase in premium writing  offset in part by a decrease in amortization expense 
interest expense first central s interest expense in  and was approximately   and  respectively 
the interest expenses were attributable primarily to interest paid under the debentures which were sold between september and january the interest expense is decreasing due primarily to first central s purchase  retirement and conversions of an aggregate of  principal amount of the original  aggregate principal amount of the debentures 
in  and    and  principal amount of the debentures  respectively  were purchased and retired 
provision for doubtful accounts the provision for doubtful accounts during   and was   and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision was due to a smaller percentage of auditable policies issued during the year 
the and increases in the provision for doubtful accounts is directly related to the increase in premium writing and the resulting increase in agents balances 
other operating expenses operating expenses remained consistant for when compared to operating expenses increased by in when compared to this increase was due to additional personnel and the related increase in payroll expenses in net income net income decreased in when compared to this was a result of an increase in ibnr reserves and paid losses see losses and loss adjustment expense reserves above as offset by increases in earned premiums  net investment income  realized gains  and claims adjusting revenue and a decrease in interest expense  underwriting expenses and doubtful accounts and income taxes 
net income increased in when compared to this was a result of increases in earned premiums  net investment income  and a decrease in interest expense offset in part by an increase in losses  loss adjustment expenses  underwriting expenses  doubtful accounts and other operating expenses  and a decrease in claims adjusting revenues and realized gains 
reinsurance first central insurance reinsures a portion of substantially all of the risks which it underwrites 
first central insurance has entered into reinsurance treaties with nat re covering all risks underwritten by first central insurance 
first central insurance also maintains an automatic facultative property loss reinsurance facility with munich american and swiss re 
see business reinsurance ceded and note of the notes to first central s consolidated financial statements for a discussion of those treaties 
in  the first central insurance ceded premiums of approximately  on approximately  of direct written premium whereas  in  premiums of approximately  were ceded on approximately  of direct written premium 
the increase in ceded premiums for was due to an increase in reinsurance rates and also a change in accounting procedures see premiums written and earned 
paid losses recovered by first central insurance in and amounted to approximately  and  respectively 
a contingent commission from swiss re  based on first central insurance s loss ratio with them  in the amount of  was received in february for the year ended december  a contingent commission  in the amount of  was due to first central insurance 
as a result of the actuarial report performed on the december  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  the ceded ibnr was increased  the effect of this increase was offset by the additional direct ibnr of  
although first central insurance believes it will be able to maintain its heretofore satisfactory relations with its reinsurers  the ability of first central insurance to directly underwrite increased volumes of insurance could be materially adversely affected in the event that one or more of its reinsuring arrangements is terminated and first central insurance is unable to replace or increase its reinsurance coverage 
liquidity and capital resources the business capacity of an insurance company is based on its liquidity and capital resources 
insurance statutes and regulations which apply to insurers require maintenance of prescribed amounts in capital and surplus as well as statutory deposits with insurance authorities 
the assets of insurers are maintained in statutorily prescribed investments 
insurers are also required to set up and have reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
furthermore  substantial statutory and regulatory restrictions are imposed upon an insurer s ability to declare and pay cash dividends 
see investments and investment portfolio  regulation  dividends and losses and loss adjustment expense reserves for a discussion of the foregoing factors as they relate to first central insurance 
see also reinsurance 
first central and first central insurance s capital resources and liquidity relative to their assets have increased during the past number of years as a result of the infusion of million net proceeds of first central s initial public offering in  million net proceeds derived by first central from the exercise of warrants in and the net proceeds of approximately million derived by first central from a private placement of its debentures in and during   units each consisting of a share of common stock and a three year warrant exercisable at per share were privately placed with one institutional investor at a price of per unit for a total purchase price of  in march   units each consisting of a share of common stock  a two year warrant exercisable at per share and a three year warrant exercisable at per share were privately placed with a second institutional investor at a price of per unit for a total purchase price of  the first placement was rescinded and replaced with a sale of  units to the same investor on terms conforming to the second placement 
 principal amount of first central s convertible subordinated debentures due were purchased at par from the investor in the first placement 
 principal amount of such debentures were purchased at par from the investor in the second placement 
in december   units each consisting of a share of common stock and a warrant exercisable at per share on or prior to march  were privately placed with the investor in the second placement at a price of per unit for a total purchase price of  during   units each consisting of a share of common stock and a warrant exercisable at per share on or before august   were privately placed with two institutional investors and a reinsurance company at per unit for a total purchase price of  management is unaware of any trend which is reasonably likely to result in a further increase or decrease in first central s or first central insurance s liquidity or capital resources except  as first central insurance s assets and investments have increased  the availability of investable funds have resulted in increased investment income and improved cash flow  and hence some increased liquidity of first central insurance 
however  first central may from time to time repurchase shares of its common stock if the appropriate conditions exist 
in addition  the liquidity of the investment portfolio of an insurance company is important to its ability to maximize investment return which is a significant component of overall profitability 
the portfolio of first central insurance included holdings of short term investments with a maturity period of one year or less equal to  and  in   and  respectively  of the total investments 
first central intends to fund its interest payment obligations currently  per year under its outstanding debentures from the dividends it receives or may receive from first central insurance 
currently  the maximum amount which may be distributed as dividends by first central insurance is approximately  in accordance with fasb statement no 
 unrealized gains or losses on securities are classified as available for sale are reported  net of the related deferred tax effect  as increases or decreases in shareholders equity 
at december   the total net unrealized gain applicable to first central s available for sale securities amounted to  net of deferred taxes of  during  first central insurance hired additional investment advisors who continually analyze first central s investment portfolio 
income taxes the tax reform act of the tax act  and the revenue reconciliation act of the tax act  contain provisions which significantly affect the taxation of insurance companies 
some of the major provisions of the tax act and the tax act are summarized below 
the tax act contained provisions which significantly increased the federal income tax liabilities of property and casualty insurance companies  including first central insurance 
under the tax act  the reserve deduction for unpaid losses previously allowed to property and casualty insurance companies was modified in a manner which has resulted in increases in first central insurance s taxable income 
although first central insurance still is able to establish reserves for the estimated amount of losses incurred  the amount of such reserves must be discounted to reflect the present value of its liability to pay anticipated claims using a discount rate of of the average of the applicable federal mid term rates 
furthermore  with respect to investments acquired after august   the tax act reduced the loss reserve deduction of property and casualty companies by of any tax exempt interest income and the deductible portion of dividends received 
the tax act also requires property and casualty companies to reduce their annual deduction for unearned premiums by and requires the inclusion in income over a six year period of of their unearned premium reserve outstanding as of december  for first central insurance  taxes payable increased due to a requirement of the tax act to reduce deductions for paid and unpaid losses by the estimated salvage and subrogation recoverable on those losses 
that change was effective for first central insurance s tax year  but the tax act provided a fresh start adjustment that permits of the estimated salvage and subrogation recoverable as of december  to be excluded from taxable income 
in addition to the foregoing provisions of the tax act and the tax act  which specifically affects the tax treatment of property and casualty insurance companies  both acts also contain provisions which are applicable to corporations generally  including first central 
among such provisions are a decrease of the maximum federal income tax rate on corporations to  a decline of the dividends received deduction for corporations to  a repeal of the investment tax credit  a change in the depreciation rules  and replacement of the corporate add on minimum tax with an expanded alternative minimum tax imposed at a rate under which  among other items  a tax exempt interest earned on certain newly issued bonds and b for years through  of the amount by which a corporation s pre tax financial statement income and for years after  of the adjusted current earnings and profits of the corporation exceeds the alternative minimum taxable income are treated as tax preference items 
management does not believe that the provisions of either of such acts have materially affected first central s future liquidity 
management further believes that increases in first central s federal income tax liability occasioned by reason of the acts provisions have not materially impacted upon first central s future results of operations or its sources or uses of capital resources 
in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  which first central was required to adopt on january  the adoption changed the method of accounting for deferred income taxes from the deferred method to the liability method 
under the deferred method  first central deferred the past tax effects of timing differences between financial reporting and taxable income 
the liability method requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
the adoption of statement no 
did not have a significant effect on the january  balance sheet or on the results of operations for the year ended december  first central had gross deferred tax assets of approximately  and gross deferred tax liabilities of approximately  as of december  a valuation allowance has not been established with respect to the deferred tax asset at december  since it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be fully realized  primarily because future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences and taxable income in prior carryback years are sufficient to realize a substantial portion of the deferred tax assets 
in addition  based on the strong earnings history of first central  future taxable income is expected to be sufficient to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
capital commitments on january  first central insurance purchased the premises in which it s corporate offices are located for a purchase price of  in cash 
prior to purchasing the building  management analyzed the relative benefits and costs of the purchase verses  among other things  the renewal of i first central insurance s lease which was to expire on november  and ii mercury s lease in the same building which was to expire on march  see item properties 
except for the purchase of the premises described above  neither first central  first central insurance  nor mercury made any material commitment for capital for and  does not anticipate any for
