results of operations comparison of fiscal vs 
the company s fiscal year was comprised of weeks  compared to weeks for fiscal net sales and earnings 
net sales increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of higher unit volume  particularly from new products  and from average selling price increases of approximately 
office products sales increased in fiscal to million from million in fiscal as a result of higher sales of office furniture products up and desktop accessories and supplies up  partially offset by lower sales of mechanical and electromechanical products down 
the sales growth in office furniture products was due primarily to higher sales of bevis brand products  particularly folding tables  computer related furniture  conference tables and screen panels 
the sales increase in desktop accessories and supplies was the result of higher sales of mediamate brand products and schwan stabilo brand products  partially offset by lower sales of lit ning brand metal desk organizing products 
the decrease in mechanical and electromechanical sales was largely due to lower sales of boston brand products  particularly pencil sharpeners  manual staplers  paper punches and office machines 
the decrease in boston brand products was primarily attributable to lost distribution at some of the company s large retail customers and to general softness in demand 
management is taking measures aimed at regaining such lost market share 
export sales of office products decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily due to lower sales to latin america particularly mexico and to a lesser extent the middle east and europe 
art craft products sales of million for fiscal increased from fiscal sales of million 
this increase was led by higher sales of presentation graphics products  which were up due to a combination of factors  including higher sales in europe  growth in the digital imaging market and increases in sales of certain mounting and laminating products eg  seal and image mounting and laminating equipment and bienfang and centafoam brand foam boards

the company s gross profit margin decreased to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of changes in product sales mix ie  higher sales for certain office furniture products and higher foreign sales  which yield lower gross profit percentages than many of the company s other products  higher raw material costs and lower sales and production volume of boston brand products 
the gross profit percentage for foreign sales was in fiscal and in fiscal higher costs of commodities  such as wood  styrene plastics and corrugated packaging materials had the greatest impact on raw material cost increases 
during the latter part of fiscal  the company began to realize the positive effects of its selling price increases and to some extent  stabilization of prices of some of its raw materials 
however  management expects the price of some of its raw materials to continue to increase in fiscal selling  shipping  administrative and general expenses 
selling and shipping expenses decreased to of net sales in fiscal from in fiscal  largely as a result of lower packing and shipping expense  primarily freight expenses  and lower sales commission expenses attributable to changes in customer sales mix

the relocation and consolidation of operations is expected to reduce costs and improve product quality and distribution performance 
the provision included recognition of future lease obligations  write off of property  plant and equipment  relocation costs  employee severance costs and other related costs 
approximately million of this provision is included in liabilities as of december  which principally relates to future severance related payments 
it is anticipated that the total pre tax charge associated with the relocation and consolidation of operations and organizational changes will range from million to million  or from 
to 
per share 
the remaining portion of these charges ranging from 
to 
per share is expected to be incurred during fiscal interest income 
interest income increased  in fiscal from fiscal due primarily to higher average cash balances

new accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires changes in accounting and reporting for impairments of long lived assets  certain identifiable intangibles and goodwill related to those assets to be held and used  and for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be disposed of 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  the company will adopt sfas no 
when required 
management does not believe the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on its results of operations or financial condition 
sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  encourages  but does not require  companies to recognize compensation expense for grants of stock  stock options  and other equity instruments to employees based upon fair value or  alternatively  permits them to continue to apply the existing accounting rules contained in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

companies choosing not to adopt the expense recognition provisions of sfas no 
are required to disclose pro forma net income and earnings per share data as if such provisions had been applied 
the company anticipates continuing to account for stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
and therefore the adoption of sfas no 
will not have an impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
environmental matters the company is involved  on a continuing basis  in monitoring its compliance with environmental laws and in making capital and operating improvements necessary to comply with existing and anticipated environmental requirements 
despite its efforts  the company has been cited for occasional violations or alleged violations of environmental laws or permits and on several occasions has been named as a potentially responsible party for the remediation of sites 
expenses incurred by the company for all years presented in the consolidated financial statements relating to violations of and compliance with environmental laws and permits and site remediation have not been material 
while it is impossible to predict with certainty  management currently does not foresee such expenses in the future as having a material effect on the company s business  results of operations or financial condition
