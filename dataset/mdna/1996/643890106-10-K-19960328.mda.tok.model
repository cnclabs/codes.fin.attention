item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion of the financial condition and results of operations on a consolidated basis for the three years ended december   of new england community bancorp  inc necb 
the consolidated financial statements of necb include the accounts of necb and its wholly owned subsidiaries  new england bank trust company nebt and the equity bank eqbk which became a subsidiary of necb on november  the transaction was accounted for as a purchase and  as such  prior year comparative data was not revised to include information about eqbk 
the changes thus noted between december  and december  reflect the addition of eqbk at november  as well as the continuing operations necb and its subsidiaries 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes of necb presented elsewhere herein 
financial condition compared to loans outstanding at year end amounted to  during the year  necb added to outstanding loans by originating new loans which exceeded repayments and payoffs by  additionally  during  necb purchased loans at a cost of  from another lender and transferred loans with the carrying amount of  to mortgages held for sale 
necb generally sells convertible adjustable rate mortgages arms from its loan portfolio when borrowers convert arms to fixed status if the term remaining to maturity is greater than ten years 
convertible arms are residential mortgage loans which have a variable rate at inception  but which subsequently permit the borrower to convert to a fixed rate at designated times 
during  necb increased securities available for sale through purchasing  of securities 
during the year  maturities and sales of securities available for sale amounted to  in contrast  the securities held to maturity decreased  with purchases amounting to  and maturities amounting to  the shift to securities available for sale allowed the company to increase its commitment to intermediate term loans while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet the continuing needs of its customers 
during  necb experienced moderate growth in deposits 
interest bearing deposits  including savings products and time deposits  increased  while non interest bearing accounts  largely commercial checking accounts  declined  the lowering of checking account balances  following a substantial increase of  in the previous year  appears to reflect the preferences of the company s customers to use their excess funds to either reduce existing loans or avoid added borrowing 
management encourages this practice through its rapid responsiveness to borrowing requests  particularly for established customers 
necb s investment in premises and equipment amounted to  at december   representing an increase of  from a year ago 
throughout  the company continued the program it began in late to improve the appearance and capability of nebt s older branch banking offices 
the enfield office was extensively remodeled and new furnishings were added 
in addition  the branch s parking area was leveled and expanded to increase the number of parking spaces for customers banking at this office 
nebt also installed a drive up atm at the somers office 
a year earlier a similar machine  installed at nebt s poquonock office  quickly became nebt s most actively used machine 
nebt opened a full service branch in canton  connecticut to serve the farmington valley market area 
finally  in december  necb purchased an  square foot office building located within the founders plaza complex in east hartford  connecticut 
this centrally located facility will house necb s growing operations and data processing departments which provide for the informational needs of necb and its subsidiaries 
compared to in the year ended december   total loans increased  this increase was primarily the result of increased demand for new credit 
as the financial health of necb s subsidiary  nebt  steadily improved  it was able to respond to this demand 
in response to this improvement  in april  the fdic removed the formal supervisory order it had imposed a year earlier 
the carrying amount of security investments consisting of securities available for sale  securities held to maturity and federal home loan bank stock decreased  as the proceeds from sales and maturities  less purchases  were used to support a portion of the growth of loans 
the decrease included a reduction of  in the carrying amount of securities available for sale to reflect the fair value of those securities in conformity with sfas no 
accounting for certain debt and equity securities 
this unrealized loss was decreased by related deferred taxes to  which changed the net unrealized holding gain of  on securities available for sale at december  in the equity section of the balance sheet to a net unrealized holding loss of  at december  at december   the unrealized loss on securities available for sale was  and the deferred taxes on such amount was  during  cash and cash equivalents were increased  to offset the volatile nature of noninterest bearing checking account liabilities which increased  during  interest bearing deposits decreased  as nebt selectively reduced interest rates offered relative to the marketplace 
during this period  shareholders equity increased as the result of several factors 
necb raised approximately  through an offering completed in december and net income added an additional  the increased investment in bank premises and equipment represents funds used to repair and improve nebt s branch offices and the purchase of equipment and technology necessary to maintain high quality services

necb reported net income for of  or per share 
this represented an increase of  or from net income for of  or per share 
this improvement resulted primarily from the  increase in net interest and dividend income 
net income for increased  or greater than the  reported for unlike  this improvement was primarily the result of the  reduction in noninterest expenses 
significant factors affecting necb s operating performance for the three years ended december   included the following net interest and dividend income compared to  and  respectively 
the net interest and dividend income for and increased  and  respectively from the preceding year

the average rate on earning assets improved to in compared to in the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities also increased  to in  from in higher rates offered to holders of time deposits attracted approximately million in new funds  while relatively low yielding savings deposits resulted in an million outflow of such deposits 
during periods of higher interest rates  interest free sources of funds such as demand deposits and equity increase in value when the interest rates available for the employment of these funds are higher 
net interest and dividend income for increased  to  from  in during  the two factors primarily responsible for the increase in net interest and dividend income were the reduction in the average rate paid for interest bearing liabilities and the growth in noninterest bearing sources of funds

noninterest income compared to  and  respectively 
noninterest income consists of service charges  commissions and fee income  net gains on the sales of investments and loans  and other income 
total noninterest income was  in this was an increase of  or from  in this followed a decrease in noninterest income of  or from  in the increase in resulted from changes in several categories of noninterest income 
gains from the sales of investments and loans increased  and  respectively 
the increase in gains from the sale of loans occurred as demand for fixed rate mortgages rose in response to declining interest rates 
this increased demand lead to increased production and subsequent sales of these fixed rate loans 
fixed rate mortgage loans are typically sold  with servicing retained by the company s subsidiaries  after origination 
service charges  commissions and fees declined  and all other income increased  the  decrease in included decreases of  and  respectively from sales of investments and loans 
also included was a  decrease in service charges and an  decrease in all other noninterest income 
the decrease in of  in service charges  commissions and fees included a  increase in loan servicing fees and a  reduction in deposit fees 
the increase in servicing fees reflected growth in the volume of serviced loans 
deposit fees declined in as depositors took advantage of other product opportunities or maintained the minimum account balances necessary to avoid service charges 
noninterest expense compared to  and  respectively 
total noninterest expense was  in  an increase of  or from  in in  total noninterest expense decreased  or from  the  increase in noninterest expense in resulted primarily from the  increase in salaries and employee benefits 
this was partially offset by the reduction of  in fees paid to the fdic for deposit insurance 
all other expenses increased  management maintains control over noninterest expenses by assigning specific managers authority for expense incurring activities providing these managers with tools for planning and monitoring the performance of their duties 
in working with senior officers line managers are better able to anticipate and minimize the expense of the goods and services needed to perform efficiently 
the decrease of  in resulted in large measure from the continuing reduction in non performing assets which had plagued necb throughout the preceding several years 
the largest reduction   related to losses  writedowns and expenses of ownership of other real estate 
banks acquire such real estate through foreclosures and other actions resulting from borrowers failing to meet the terms of loans secured by such properties 
outside services  principally legal fees related to foreclosures preceding decreased  and the cost of fdic fees and other insurance decreased  all other expenses increased  during  including occupancy and equipment expense   marketing   and  the resumption of the payment of fees to directors   nonperforming assets and allowance for possible loan losses nonperforming assets include nonaccrual loans and assets classified as oreo 
generally  loans are placed in nonaccrual status when they are past due greater than ninety days or the repayment of interest or principal is considered to be in doubt 
oreo consists of properties acquired through foreclosure proceedings 
these properties are recorded at the lower of the carrying value of the related loans or the estimated fair market value less estimated selling costs 
charges to the allowance for loan losses are the measure by which properties are reduced to fair market value less estimated selling expenses upon reclassification as oreo 
subsequent reductions are charged to operating income 
necb s subsidiaries make provisions on a quarterly basis for possible loan losses as determined by a continuing assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for possible loan losses 
necb s subsidiaries perform ongoing reviews of loans in accordance with an individual loan rating system to determine the required allowance for possible loan losses at any given date 
the review of loans is performed to estimate potential exposure to losses 
in the review process  the subsidiaries assess factors including the borrowers past and current financial condition  repayment ability and liquidity  the nature of collateral and changes in its value  current and anticipated economic conditions and other factors deemed appropriate 
these reviews are dependent upon estimates  appraisals and judgments which can change quickly because of changing economic conditions and management s perception as to how these factors affect the financial condition of debtors 
the loan rating process classifies loans according to the subsidiaries uniform classification system 
the subsidiaries consider performing loans rated as substandard and doubtful to be potential problem loans 
substandard loans are characterized by well defined weaknesses such as deteriorating or inadequate collateral or impaired repayment ability 
a loan is considered doubtful when similar conditions exist but are more severe in nature 
at december   necb considered loans totaling approximately  which considers  for the first time  eqbk s loan portfolio to be potential problems compared to  at december  included in these totals were loans totaling  and  respectively  which were not classified as non performing loans because such loans are performing according to their terms 
necb s subsidiaries loan review processes are designed to identify certain potential problem loans at an early stage  alleviate weaknesses in each respective institution lending policies  oversee the individual loan rating system and ensure compliance with nebt s and eqbk s underwriting  documentation  compliance and administrative policies 
certain potential problem loans mean loans considered by management as being in need of special attention because of some deficiency related to the credit or documentation  but which are still considered collectable and performing 
such attention is intended to act as preventative measures and thereby avoid more serious problems in the future 
accrued interest income is generally reversed against interest income when loans are classified as nonaccrual  unless management deems that the value of collateral is sufficient to recover both principal and accrued interest 
real estate held for sale consists of properties acquired through mortgage loan foreclosure proceedings 
real estate owned is carried at the lower of the carrying value of the related loan or the estimated fair market value of the property less estimated selling costs 
necb s nonperforming assets at december  through are presented below 
had the nonaccrual loans performed in accordance with their original terms  gross interest income for the year ended would have increased by approximately  compared to an increase of approximately  for the year ended as reflected below  necb has made significant progress since reaching a high of  at december  amounts in thousands at december  nonaccrual loans      other real estate owned    total nonperforming assets      loans past due in excess of ninety days and accruing interest total nonperforming assets increased by  or  to  at december  from  at december  in  total nonperforming assets decreased  or from  at december  loans past due in excess of ninety days and accruing interest amounted to  this compared to balances of  and  respectively  at december  and the increase in total nonperforming assets in the year ended december  resulted from the inclusion  for the first time  of  in nonaccrual loans and  in oreo held by eqbk acquired on november  and decreases of  in nonaccrual loans and  in oreo held by nebt 
total nonperforming assets represented of total loans and other real estate owned at december   as compared to and respectively  at december  and improvement in this ratio is the result of reductions in nonperforming assets and the increase in total loans 
the allowance for loan losses increased to of total loans at december  from at december   and at december  respectively 
the coverage afforded to nonperforming assets and loans past due ninety days and still accruing was compared to and for december  and  respectively 
real estate acquired through foreclosure was  in   in  and  in the allowance for possible loan losses was equal to of nonaccrual loans at december   as compared to and  respectively  at december  and amounts in thousands december  nonaccrual loans    other real estate owned  total nonperforming assets    loans past due in excess of ninety days and accruing interest ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans and oreo ratio of nonperforming assets and loans past due in excess of ninety days and accruing interest to total loans oreo ratio of allowance loan losses to total loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to nonperforming assets and loans in excess of ninety days past due and accruing interests ratio of nonperforming assets and loans in excess of ninety days out past due and accruing interest to total shareholders equity the following table summarizes the activity in the allowance for possible loan losses for the years ended december  through the allowance is maintained at a level consistent with identified loss potential and the perceived risk in the portfolio 
it is not considered meaningful to allocate the allowance according to geographic area as necb s market area is homogenous and limited in size 
amounts in thousands december  loans charged off commercial and financial real estate  installment loans to individuals recoveries on loans charged off commercial and financial real estate installment loans to individuals net loans charged off    provision charged to operations   balance  at beginning of year      changes incident to merger  balance  at end of year      ratio of net charge offs during the period to average loans outstanding during the period ratio of allowance for loans losses to total loans necb s subsidiaries continually assess the adequacy of their allowances for loan losses in response to changing economic conditions  specific problem loans  and the overall risk profile of their loan portfolios 
management allocates specific reserves to individual problem loans based upon management s analysis of the potential for loss perceived to exist related to such loans 
in addition to the specific reserves for individual loans  a portion of the allowance is maintained as a general reserve 
the amount of the general reserve is determined through management s analysis of the potential for loss inherent in those loans not considered problem loans 
among the factors considered by management in this analysis are the number and type of loans  nature and amount of collateral pledged to secure such loans  and current economic conditions 
during the years ended and  nebt made substantial provisions to the allowance in response to the recognition of problem loans and the potential for loss perceived to be inherent in the portfolio as a result of economic conditions and declines in real estate values 
thereafter  in and the reduction in provisions reflects the stabilization of the economy  the improved performance of the loan portfolio and recoveries of previously charged off loans 
the following table reflects the allowance for loan losses as of december  with allocations categorized by loan type amounts in thousands allocation of percentage of loans in allowance for each category to total loans by type loan losses loans commercial financial real estate construction residential  commercial  installment other total  liquidity management s objective is to ensure continuous ability to meet cash needs as they arise 
such needs may occur from time to time as a result of fluctuations in loan demand and the level of total deposits 
accordingly  necb s subsidiaries have liquidity policies which provide flexibility to meet cash needs 
the liquidity objective is achieved through the maintenance of readily marketable investment securities as well as a balanced flow of asset maturities  prudent pricing on loan and deposit products and the sale of mortgage loans in the secondary market 
the policy also provides management with the ability to acquire and hold debt instruments known collectively as structured notes 
structured notes  which can differ as to particular terms  are used by management to reduce the potential effect changes in interest rates can have upon the operating results of the company 
from time to time  management invests in various types of structured notes such as dual index notes and interest rate step up notes as part of its overall management of the risk of changes to interest rates 
in  necb adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for certain debt and equity securities 
the statement  issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb  set forth guidance for accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
adoption of statement no 
resulted in several changes to the information provided in the financial statements of necb 
the first change resulted from the separation of investment security assets into those held to maturity and those available for sale 
the second change resulted from the change to the carrying value of the group held available for sale to reflect the current market values of the assets held 
the amount of this mark to market value is then added to or deducted from the equity portion of necb s balance sheet after appropriate reduction to reflect the value of the related deferred taxes 
at december   the amount added to necb s shareholders equity was  while  was deducted from shareholders equity a year earlier 
during the year end of and during  it did not become necessary for necb to increase its borrowed funds to meet its liquidity needs 
necb has alternative sources of liquidity available including federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements 
purchases of federal funds and borrowing on repurchase agreements may be utilized to meet short term borrowing needs 
during nebt joined the federal home loan bank of boston fhlbb to further enhance its liquidity position 
the fhlbb provides its member banks with credit by accepting as collateral the member bank s mortgage assets 
through its membership  nebt has available a line of credit for  and also has the ability to pledge up to  of its assets to meet its credit needs 
eqbk has available a line of credit for  and also has the ability to pledge up to  of its assets to meet its credit needs 
necb believes that its policies will enable it to maintain adequate liquidity and to prudently commit funds to loans or investments  depending upon underlying risk  demand and rate of return 
as shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows  necb experienced a decrease of  in the amount of cash and cash equivalents at december  compared to december  this compares to the significant increase of  in  compared to december the increase in was largely due to the  received in december as proceeds from the issuance of  shares of necb s stock coupled with an increase throughout the year in demand deposit account balances 
demand deposit accounts represent a volatile source of funds which is subject to significant inflows and outflows of both seasonal and cyclical nature 
capital at december   total shareholders equity was  an increase of  compared to  at december  in november  in acquiring the equity bank   shares of common stock were issued by necb at a value of  representing the inclusion of the adjusted net assets of eqbk 
also increasing capital in was the retention of  in earned income and the  change in the unrealized holding gain loss on securities available for sale 
during  shareholders equity increased  to  at december   from  at december  in december  necb completed an offering which raised  in new capital funds 
the offering resulted in the issuance of  new shares of common stock 
also adding to capital was net income of  the various capital ratios of eqbk  nebt and necb are as follows as of december  minimum level eqbk nebt necb leverage tier risk based total risk based income taxes income tax expense for was  which is an effective income tax rate of 
this compares to income tax expense of  in and  in in february  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes 
the effect of adoption of statement no 
in upon results is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and recent accounting developments the adoption of financial accounting standard no 
in december requires that necb classify debt and equity securities into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
this security classification may be modified after acquisition only under certain specified conditions 
in general  securities may be classified as held to maturity only if necb has the positive intent and ability to hold them to maturity 
trading securities are defined as those bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term 
all other securities must be classified as available for sale 
in may  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the statement requires that impaired loans be measured on a loan by loan basis by either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  the loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the statement is applicable to all creditors and to all loans  except large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  loans that are measured at fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value  leases  and convertible or nonconvertible debentures and bonds and other debt securities 
the statement applies to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  management has determined that the financial statement impact of adopting the provisions of this statement is not material 
in october of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
disclosure about derivative financial instruments and fair value of financial instruments 
this statement requires disclosures about derivative financial instruments futures  forward  swap  and option contracts  and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
it also amends existing requirements of fasb statement no 
 disclosure of information about financial instruments with off balance sheet risk and financial instruments with concentrations of credit risk  and fasb statement no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
this statement  which was effective for  did not have a material impact upon necb s financial statements 
in may of  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for mortgage servicing rights 
this statement requires that a mortgage banking enterprise recognize as a separate asset rights to service mortgage loans for others  however those servicing rights are acquired 
a mortgage banking enterprise that acquires mortgage servicing rights through either the purchase or origination of mortgage loans or sells or securities those loans with servicing rights retained should allocate the total cost of the mortgage loans to the mortgage servicing rights and to the loans without the mortgage servicing rights based on their fair values if practicable to estimate those fair values 
if it is not practicable to estimate the fair values of the mortgage servicing rights and the mortgage loans without the mortgage servicing rights  the entire cost of purchasing and originating the loans should be allocated to the mortgage loans without the mortgage servicing rights and no cost should be allocated to the mortgage servicing rights 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is not expected to have a material impact on necb as it does not have significant loan servicing operations 
in october of  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for stock based employee compensation plans  including arrangements by which employees receive options to purchase shares of necb s stock 
this statement defines a fair value based method of accounting for an employee stock option or similar equity instrument and encourages all entities to adopt that method of accounting for their employee stock compensation plans 
however  it also allows an entity to continue to measure compensation for those plans using the method of accounting in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
entities selecting to remain with the accounting in opinion no 
complete must make pro forma disclosures of net income and  if presented earnings per share  as if the fair value based method of accounting in sfas no 
had been applied 
the accounting and disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for necb in for all awards in and thereafter 
management believes that the financial statement impact of adoption the provisions of this statement will not be material 
impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto presented elsewhere herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative value of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  most of the assets and virtually all of the liabilities of necb are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on necb s performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
recent developments on december   the boards of directors of necb  nebt and manchester state bank  a connecticut chartered commercial bank with its principal place of business in manchester  connecticut  executed a plan and agreement of reorganization the agreement 
pursuant to the agreement  upon consummation of the transaction  it is anticipated that shareholders of manchester state bank will exchange each share of common stock of manchester state bank for the reorganization consideration consisting of payable in cash and shares of new england s common stock 
the agreement is subject to conditions including approval by regulatory authorities and the shareholders of manchester state bank
