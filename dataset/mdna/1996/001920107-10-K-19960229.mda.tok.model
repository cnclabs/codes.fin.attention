item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in connection with the information contained in the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto 
overview the company manufactures and markets intermediate chemicals and specialty products  operating in a single industry segment 
it conducts business primarily in the western hemisphere  europe  and the asia pacific region 
each of the company s two principal manufacturing processes yield its key product  propylene oxide po  and one of two co products  styrene monomer sm or tertiary butyl alcohol tba 
the company also manufactures numerous derivatives of these products 
among these are methyl tertiary butyl ether mtbe  a derivative of tba used in oxygenated fuels and as an octane enhancer 
another is polyols  a derivative of po 
in  the company began selling toluene diisocyanate tdi obtained under long term supply agreements 
tdi and polyols are combined in the manufacture of polyurethanes 
net income for was million compared with million in net income in increased over primarily due to improved margins for po and derivatives and a significant improvement in sm margins 
the margin improvements were primarily attributable to higher prices  which more than offset increases in the costs of raw materials 
net income of million in increased over net income of million primarily due to higher po and derivatives volumes and higher sm margins and volumes  partly offset by the effects of a weaker mtbe market 
the period also benefitted from lower interest expense 
net income for these years included special items  on an after tax basis  as follows a million restructuring charge and a million benefit from insurance proceeds in  a million loss on early debt retirement and million of net benefits from lower income taxes in results of operations product volumes sales and other operating revenues include the sales and processing volumes of po  tba  sm and their derivatives as set forth below for the years indicated 
year ended december  millions po and derivatives pounds    co products tba and derivatives gallons    sm and derivatives pounds    revenues revenues increased percent to  million in from  million in primarily due to higher sales prices 
while sales prices were generally higher for all products  average sm sales prices increased significantly versus the period as a result of higher worldwide demand during the early part of volume benefits from higher domestic mtbe volumes and first time sales of tdi were substantially offset by lower volumes for po and derivatives 
domestic mtbe volumes increased versus primarily due to increased demand  which resulted from implementation of the reformulated gasoline phase of the clean air act in po and derivatives volumes in decreased six percent compared to primarily due to the entry of a new po producer into the us market in late as well as lower asia pacific sales  which were affected by a slowdown in china markets 
revenues increased seven percent in versus with the majority of the increase attributable to higher average sales prices 
sales prices were generally higher for all products 
revenues also benefitted from higher volumes for po and sm and their derivatives  partly offset by lower us mtbe volumes 
po and derivatives volumes in increased percent versus due to a strong us economy  increased market penetration by propylene glycol based deicers and coolants  and a recovering economy in europe 
sm and derivatives volumes in increased percent over primarily due to higher sm export sales  reflecting increased worldwide demand  and higher sm contractual offtakes by the limited partners in the po sm ii plant 
lower us mtbe volumes reflected lower contractual sales volumes and flat demand for mtbe as an oxygenate coupled with increased worldwide capacity 
additionally  demand for mtbe in world octane markets was lower 
gross profit gross profit increased percent to  million in from million in  reflecting the percent increase in revenues as well as higher margins 
overall gross profit was percent of sales in compared to percent in as higher sales prices more than offset net increases in raw materials costs 
the margin improvements were seen in po and derivatives  especially in the fourth quarter  and in sm margins during the first half of the year 
average sm margins improved significantly in as evidenced by industry raw material margins  which doubled  on average  compared to sm prices and margins increased substantially during the first half of  but declined over the second half as worldwide demand declined 
raw material cost comparisons  versus  were mixed with substantial increases in average propylene costs  more moderate increases in average butane and ethylene costs and a decrease in average benzene and methanol costs 
gross profit increased percent to million in from million in  reflecting the seven percent increase in revenues as well as higher margins  primarily for co products 
overall gross profit was percent of sales in compared to percent in the improvement was primarily due to higher prices for sm and us mtbe 
higher sm prices were attributable to increased worldwide demand and a series of planned and unplanned outages at producers plants that reduced available supplies 
us mtbe prices reflected the escalation in market prices of methanol  which peaked in the fourth quarter of the  and periods included pretax charges of million  million and million  respectively  in costs and other operating expenses for estimated future environmental cleanup costs 
these charges do not reflect any potential benefit from insurance proceeds 
other in  management adopted a corporate restructuring program  resulting in a pretax charge of million  primarily for costs associated with personnel reductions 
this item was reported as restructuring costs in interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest expense declined in from due to lower debt levels and lower interest rates on certain foreign bank borrowing 
other income expense  net  was million in  million in  and million in the period reflected higher equity earnings from the company s japanese po sm joint venture and higher interest income  partly offset by higher foreign exchange losses 
the period included an million pretax benefit from an insurance settlement related to the channelview plant incident 
the decrease in reflects a pretax loss of million on early retirement of debt 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate was percent in  percent in  and percent in the decrease in reflected benefits from higher export income and increased utilization of foreign tax credits due to higher foreign earnings 
the low rate in reflects recognition of deferred foreign assets 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents compared with million at december  the consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended december  shows that net cash flows provided by operating activities were million  whereas net cash flows used by investment and financing activities were million and million  respectively 
operating cash flow in was affected by increases in receivables and inventories of million and million  respectively  excluding related party receivables and foreign exchange effects 
the accounts receivable increase is primarily due to the integration of the tdi business in the increase in inventory reflects a combination of low inventory levels at year end and a slowdown in second half sales 
investment activities in included expenditures for plant and equipment of million  which was comparable to the million spent in a significant portion of the and capital programs were devoted to environmental  health and safety projects as well as po derivative capacity expansions at existing facilities 
the company s capital budget for plant and equipment is million 
the board of directors has approved commencement of engineering studies for the expansion of the po sm complex located in channelview  texas and the construction of a new world scale po sm plant in rotterdam  the netherlands 
final board of directors approval of such projects will depend on the results of engineering studies  the receipt of permitting approvals and the conclusion of certain commercial arrangements 
in connection with the plant project in rotterdam  the company anticipates that it will make capital commitments denominated in a foreign currency beginning in and extending through the company has entered into foreign currency forward and purchased option contracts to minimize the foreign exchange exposures associated with these anticipated commitments 
the notional amount of foreign currency contracts outstanding increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to these contracts 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in january  the company entered into a long term supply arrangement with rhone poulenc rp for toluene diisocyanate tdi 
adding tdi to the list of products sold by the company complements the company s existing line of polyols products and strengthens the company s position in the polyurethanes market 
effective january   the company was entitled to the entire tdi output of rp s two plants in france  which have a combined annual capacity of approximately million pounds 
the company made an initial payment of million at closing for capacity reservation fees and other long term rights and costs 
these are reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as deferred charges and other assets and are being amortized on a straight line basis over the year period of the agreement 
the company is obligated to pay additional capacity reservation fees and purchase minimum quantities of tdi for periods of up to years 
the company s projected tdi sales volumes exceed the minimum purchase quantities  and the company expects to fund the obligations under this arrangement through cash flows from increased sales revenues 
in december  an explosion occurred at one of rp s plants 
as a result  rp may not be able to supply the full amount of tdi to the company from this rp plant for several months 
during this period of time  certain of the fees payable by the company to rp for the production from this rp plant will be abated 
the company paid dividends totalling million in  including a 
per share dividend  totalling million  during the quarter ended december  on january   the board of directors declared a dividend of 
per share on the company s common stock  payable march  the company maintains a credit agreement under which it can borrow amounts of up to million 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings against the credit agreement  which is used to back up the company s commercial paper borrowing 
it is expected that future cash requirements for capital expenditures  dividends and debt repayments will be met by cash generated from operating activities and additional borrowing 
effects of inflation based on the age of the company s fixed assets  it is estimated that the replacement cost of those assets is greater than the historical cost reflected in the company s financial statements 
accordingly  the company s depreciation and amortization expense for the three years ended december   would be greater if the expense were stated on a current cost basis 
risk management the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce certain types of financial risk 
use of derivatives is limited to simple  non leveraged instruments placed with major financial institutions whose creditworthiness is monitored 
company policy provides restrictions on concentrating credit risk in any one institution 
hedging strategies and transactions are reviewed and approved by management before being implemented 
monthly market valuations and quarterly sensitivity analyses are performed to monitor the effectiveness of the company s risk management program 
the company enters into the following activities using derivative financial instruments foreign currency forward contracts  option contracts and swap contracts to reduce the risk of foreign currency fluctuations on future cash flows  and  to a lesser extent  interest rate swaps to minimize the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the company s outstanding floating rate debt 
feedstock costs see raw materials included in items and environmental the company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations 
these contingencies include possible obligations to remove or mitigate the effects on the environment of the past disposal or release of certain chemical substances at various sites remediation costs 
the company continues to evaluate the amount of these remediation costs and periodically adjusts its reserve for remediation costs and its estimate of additional environmental loss contingencies based on progress made in determining the magnitude  method and timing of the remedial actions that may be required by government authorities and an evaluation of the company s potential liability in relation to the liability and financial resources of any other potentially responsible parties 
reflected in costs and other operating expenses for is a million pretax charge for estimated future remediation costs compared with million in and million in at december   the company s environmental reserve totaled million  which reflected the company s latest assessment of potential future remediation costs associated with existing sites 
a significant portion of the reserve is related to the company s beaver valley pennsylvania facility 
the remainder of the reserve is related to four other plant sites and two federal superfund sites for amounts ranging from million to million per site 
the company is involved in administrative proceedings or lawsuits relating to seven other superfund sites 
however  it estimates  based on currently available information  that potential loss contingencies associated with these seven sites  individually and in the aggregate  are not significant 
substantially all amounts reserved are expected to be paid out over the next five to ten years 
the company relies upon remedial investigation feasibility studies ri fs at each site as a basis for estimating remediation costs at the site 
the company has substantially completed ri fs at most of its sites  however  two plant facilities are currently undergoing either ri fs or preliminary assessments 
in addition  selection of the remediation method and the cleanup standard to be applied is  in most cases  subject to approval by the appropriate government authority 
accordingly  the company may have possible loss contingencies in excess of the amounts reserved to the extent the scope of remediation required  the final remediation method selected and the cleanup standard applied vary from the assumptions used in estimating the reserve 
the company estimates that the upper range of these possible loss contingencies should not exceed the amount accrued by more than million 
the extent of loss related to environmental matters ultimately depends upon a number of factors  including technological developments  changes in environmental laws  the number and ability to pay of other parties involved at a particular site and the company s potential involvement in additional environmental assessments and cleanups 
based upon currently known facts  management believes that any remediation costs the company may incur in excess of the amounts reserved or disclosed above would not have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial statements
