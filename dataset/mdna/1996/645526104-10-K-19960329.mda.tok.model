na general handex corporation company conducts two distinct lines of business  its environmental segment which has been its core business and the educational segment  which the company started in august with its acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of new horizons franchising  inc and all of the assets of new horizons learning center  inc the discussion that follows and note to the consolidated financial statements see item highlight the business conditions and certain financial information specific to each of the two business segments 
environmental business segment the company conducts the environmental segment of its business through a subsidiary  handex environmental  inc  and its subsidiaries collectively handex environmental 
net operating revenues include fees for services provided directly by handex environmental  and fees for arranging for subcontractors services  as well as proceeds from the rental and sale of equipment 
handex environmental  in the course of providing its services  routinely subcontracts for outside services such as soil cartage  laboratory testing and other specialized services 
these costs are generally passed through to clients and  in accordance with industry practice  are included in total operating revenues 
because subcontractor services can change significantly from project to project  changes in total operating revenues may not be truly indicative of business trends 
accordingly  handex environmental views net operating revenues  which is total operating revenues less the cost of subcontractor services  as its primary measure of revenue growth 
cost of net operating revenues includes professional salaries  other direct labor  material purchases and certain direct and indirect overhead costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses include management salaries  sales and marketing salaries and expenses  and clerical and administrative overhead 
during and  several trends continued to develop which handex environmental believes will have a direct impact on its future results of operations 
handex environmental believes that expenses for administration  computerization  marketing and engineering will continue to increase 
administrative costs have increased and will continue to increase as a result of the increasing desire of handex environmental s customers for more detailed information concerning the status of their environmental projects 
handex environmental s marketing costs will continue to increase due to the effects of increased competition in the environmental industry and handex environmental s strategy to diversify its client base 
handex environmental s customers have become increasingly cost conscious during recent periods in part due to their own financial constraints 
to date  this cost consciousness on the part of customers has manifested itself primarily in three areas i the manner in which handex environmental obtains its business and charges for its services  ii the use of other contractors to provide certain services traditionally provided by handex environmental  and iii an increasing preference to purchase  rather than lease  remediation equipment 
over the last four years  handex environmental has experienced a significant increase in customer demand for competitive bidding and or fixed price contracts 
during and  a majority of handex environmental s work was performed under fixed price contracts and unit prices 
price has become the primary factor in the environmental remediation services market 
however  management believes that  over the long term  the quality and cost effectiveness of its services will continue to be an important competitive advantage 
accordingly  in responding to price competition  handex environmental will attempt to maintain a high level of technical quality in its services 
a majority of handex environmental s major customers now purchase from other contractors equipment and certain services  such as laboratory analyses  which were formerly provided by or through handex environmental as part of its full service approach 
management believes that this trend will continue 
handex environmental s quarterly results may fluctuate from period to period 
among the principal factors influencing quarterly variations are weather  which may limit the amount of time handex environmental s professional and technical personnel have in the field  the addition of new professionals who require training and initially bill a lower percentage of their time  the timing of receipt of discharge and other permits necessary to install dewatering and recovery systems  and the opening of new offices  which initially have higher expenses relative to revenues than established offices 
in recent years  handex environmental s business has been helped considerably by the cost reimbursement program maintained by the state of florida through the florida inland protection trust fund 
during the first quarter of  the florida inland protection trust fund was revised by the florida legislature and now requires site prioritization and prior approval of costs by the florida department of environmental protection for reimbursement of cleanup expenditures 
these revisions which were intended to assure its economic integrity  have significantly limited the number and types of environmental cleanup expenditures which would be reimbursable from the fund and have therefore  adversely affected handex environmental s operating results in florida and its overall operating results in management believes that these revisions will continue to have an adverse effect on handex environmental s operations in florida and the company s environmental segment results as a whole 
during  handex environmental acquired the assets of a small environmental concern in florida in a strategic move to partially offset the revenue loss resulting from revisions to the fund reimbursement program 
educational business segment the company operates the educational segment of its business through its subsidiary  new horizons education corporation  and its subsidiaries new horizons collectively new horizons 
there are two distinct businesses in the educational segment  one operates wholly owned training centers  and the second  supplies systems of instruction  sales and management concepts concerning computer training to independent franchisees 
revenues for the training centers operated by new horizons consist primarily of training fees and fees derived from sales of courseware materials 
cost of sales consists primarily of instructors salaries and benefits  facilities costs such as rent  utilities and classroom equipment  courseware  and computer hardware  software and peripherals 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs associated with technical support personnel  facilities support personnel  scheduling personnel  training personnel  accounting and finance support and sales executives 
revenues for the franchising operation consist primarily of initial franchise fees associated with the sale of a franchise  royalty and advertising fees based on a percentage of franchisee gross training revenues  and percentage royalties received on the gross sales of courseware 
cost of sales consists primarily of costs associated with franchise support personnel who provide system guidelines and advice on daily operating issues including sales  marketing  instructor training and general business problems
