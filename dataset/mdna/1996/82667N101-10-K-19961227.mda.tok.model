coffee  inc 
mr 
coffee  by means of a merger of a wholly owned subsidiary of the company with and into mr 
coffee the acquisition 
subsequently  mr 
coffee was merged into the company s health o meter  inc subsidiary 
the aggregate purchase price in connection with the acquisition was approximately million 
the company s operations are conducted through two divisions 
these divisions are the consumer products division and the professional products division 
mr 
coffee historically realized significantly greater annual sales and had a much larger asset base than the company 
during fiscal the last full fiscal year prior to the acquisition  mr 
coffee had net sales of approximately million and  at december   it had total assets of approximately million 
the acquisition was accounted for as a purchase  and the company s results of operations for fiscal reflect the inclusion of mr 
coffee s results of operations for the period subsequent to august  on a pro forma basis  giving effect to the acquisition as if it had occurred at the beginning of fiscal  the company s net sales would have been million and its net loss would have been million in the nine month fiscal period 
on september   the board of directors of the company determined to change the company s fiscal year from one ending on december in each year to a week fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to the last day of the month of september in each year 
as a result of the change in the company s fiscal year  the results of operations for fiscal are not directly comparable with those of prior years or of fiscal in particular  fiscal results do not reflect results of operations for the last calendar quarter of the fiscal year  during which the company and mr 
coffee have historically achieved their highest net sales 
during the four fiscal years prior to the acquisition  the company s fourth quarter net sales have represented an average of approximately of annual net sales 
during the same period  mr 
coffee s fourth quarter net sales have represented an average of approximately of its annual net sales 
set forth below is a discussion of the principal factors which affected the company s results of operations during each of the three most recent fiscal periods  and an analysis of the company s liquidity and capital resources 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
results of operations fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended october  net sales 
net sales for fiscal increased approximately to million  compared with million for fiscal net sales of the consumer products division increased approximately to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the increase in net sales of the consumer products division was due primarily to sales of the recently introduced automatic hot teamaker  mrs 
tea tm 
consumer products division sales were also favorably impacted by higher sales of consumer scales attributable to increased distribution of electronic strain gauge scales at certain mass merchandisers 
new distribution of filters also favorably impacted fiscal sales 
these sales increases were partially offset by a decline in coffeemaker and iced teamaker sales reflecting an overall small appliance industry sales decline and lower retail activity resulting from severe winter weather conditions experienced in the second quarter of fiscal therapeutic device sales declined in fiscal as the company introduced four new therapeutic product categories in late fiscal to replace the less profitable shiatsu double hand massager 
net sales of the professional products division declined approximately to million  primarily because fiscal sales had been favorable impacted by the us postal rate increase in january  which generated incremental sales of postal scale dials  electronic rate chips and postal scales to accommodate the new rates 
the professional products sales decline was partially offset in fiscal by improved sales of analog medical and consumer bath scales to foreign customers 
overall sales to the company s top five customers during fiscal accounted for approximately of net sales  compared with approximately of net sales in fiscal due to the continuing consolidation of major retailers  the company believes that its dependence on sales to its largest customers  all major retailers  will continue 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit in fiscal was million  or approximately of net sales  compared with million  or approximately of net sales in fiscal the addition of new higher margin products to the sales mix  as well as improvements in operating efficiency during contributed to the overall gross profit improvement 
the consumer products division s gross profit increased from approximately of net sales for fiscal to approximately of net sales for fiscal the consumer products division s gross profit percentage reflects the favorable impact from sales of the recently introduced automatic hot teamaker  mrs 
tea tm  as well as lower costs for key raw material such as paper  certain imported appliances and packaging material 
historically  gross margins on individual product lines have been greatest near the point of introduction and gradually decreasing as the product matures and becomes subject to pricing pressure 
for this reason  the company continues its efforts to introduce new products and to reduce the cost of existing products as a means of protecting margins 
the professional products division s gross profit declined from approximately of net sales for fiscal to approximately of net sales for fiscal the gross profit of the professional products division was favorably impacted during fiscal by the us postal rate increase in january which was not repeated in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal totaled million  compared with million for fiscal for both fiscal and  sg a approximated of net sales 
the overall increase in sg a is attributable to higher national advertising expenditures to support the marketing of new products  such as mrs 
tea tm  and proportionately higher variable selling costs related to increased sales 
higher bad debt expense  as a result of bankruptcy and liquidation filings by certain customers  also contributed to the increase in sg a 
amortization of intangible assets 
the amortization of intangible assets of million  or per share  relates primarily to intangible assets associated with the acquisition in august interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal was approximately million  compared with million for fiscal the decrease in interest expense is attributable to slightly lower overall interest rates during fiscal  compared with fiscal income taxes 
income tax expense of million is based upon the income before income taxes adjusted principally for non deductible amortization expense 
the company s effective tax rate for was approximately  compared with approximately for expenses not deductible for tax purposes  primarily the amortization of intangible assets associated with the acquisition  resulted in an effective tax rate significantly higher than the statutory tax rate in both years 
the higher level of pretax income in relative to reduced the effect of these non deductible expenses resulting in a lower effective tax rate in net income 
based on the foregoing  the company achieved net income of million in fiscal  compared with net income of million in fiscal fiscal year ended october  compared with nine month period ended october net sales 
net sales for fiscal increased approximately to million  compared with million for the nine months included in fiscal net sales of mr 
coffee r brand products contributed in excess of of the sales increase  as only six weeks of these sales were consolidated with those of the company in the balance of the increase is largely a result of comparing a full year in with only nine months of operations in overall sales to the company s top five customers during fiscal accounted for approximately of net sales  versus approximately in fiscal the increased share of the company s net sales made to its top five customers is attributable to the impact of a full year of sales of mr 
coffee r brand products as well as increased volume to these customers as a whole 
gross profit 
the company s gross profit in fiscal was million  or approximately of net sales  compared with million  or approximately of net sales in fiscal the gross profit percentage in fiscal was depressed primarily as a result of the impact of an increase in the company s provision for product returns  and certain changes in accounting estimates and additional accruals 
without giving effect to these charges  the company s overall gross profit margin would have been approximately in fiscal gross profit dollars increased over the prior fiscal year primarily due to the impact of the gross profit earned on mr 
coffee r brand products sales for a full year in fiscal compared with six weeks in fiscal as well as the gross profit earned on a full year of sales for the company in fiscal versus nine months in fiscal during fiscal  gross profit percentages returned to historical levels 
the improvement in the company s gross profit percentage was accomplished despite cost increases in key raw materials such as steel  paperboard and resin  all of which are used in a majority of the company s products 
the increase in raw material costs was somewhat mitigated not only by the achievement of certain operating efficiencies  but also by price increases on many of the company s products 
there continues to be intense pressure on retail prices and there is no guarantee that the company will be able to achieve price increases from its customers in the future 
the consumer products divison s gross margin also was favorably impacted by an improved product mix which included a larger percentage of higher margin products and cost savings achieved by sourcing a greater percentage of scales from foreign manufacturers 
the professional products division s gross margin improved because of an increase in office product sales as a result of the january postal rate increase 
gross margins on replacement rate dials and electronic rate chips related to the postal rate increase are higher than the professional products division s historical rates 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a for fiscal totaled million  compared with million for fiscal the increase in magnitude of sg a is principally due to having incurred a full twelve months expense versus only nine months of sg a for health o meter r and pelouze r brand product sales and six weeks of sg a for mr 
coffee r brand product sales during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a declined from approximately in to approximately in the current year 
this decline is primarily attributable to fixed selling  general and administrative costs being spread over a much larger net sales amount as well as efficiencies gained during the year from the elimination of duplicate functions through integration of the accounting and information systems and the legal and administrative functions 
amortization of intangible assets 
the increase in amortization to million from million results from a full year s amortization of the excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired associated with the acquisition in august interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal was approximately million  compared with million for fiscal the large increase in interest expense is attributable to a full year s impact of the increase in the company s indebtedness resulting from the additional long term debt incurred to finance the acquisition and other related costs as well as increases in both the prime interest rate and libor rate used as a basis for the rate charged on the company s floating rate debt 
income taxes 
income tax expense of million is based upon the income before income taxes adjusted principally for non deductible amortization expense 
net income 
based on the foregoing  the company achieved net income of million in fiscal versus a net loss of million in the previous fiscal period 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity are cash generated by operating activities and borrowings under a credit agreement among health o meter and a group of banks represented by banque nationale de paris  new york branch bnp as agent and as issuer of letters of credit the bank credit agreement entered into in connection with the acquisition 
cash flow activity for fiscal and is presented in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
during fiscal  the company generated approximately million in cash flow from its operating activities 
net income plus non cash charges generated approximately million  while changes in working capital components required approximately million 
the increase in accounts receivable  which required approximately million  is primarily attributable to seasonally higher sales and sales of the recently introduced automatic hot teamaker  mrs 
tea tm 
an increase in inventory primarily attributable to the need to respond to retailers seasonal demands for products  required approximately million 
the company s business is somewhat seasonal  with a large portion of its sales and earnings generated in the fourth calendar of the year 
during fiscal and  the company generated approximately of its annual net sales during the fiscal quarters ended december  and january the company s aggregate capital expenditures during fiscal were approximately million  and primarily reflect expenditures for new product tooling  production equipment and a computerized design system to streamline the company s new product development cycle 
during fiscal  the company anticipates making capital expenditures of approximately million primarily for new product tooling  information systems and production equipment 
management plans to fund these capital expenditures with available cash  cash flow from operations and  if necessary  borrowings under the revolving credit facility provided under the bank credit agreement 
indebtedness incurred in connection with the acquisition has significantly increased the company s cash requirements and imposes various restrictions on its operations 
the acquisition and related transactions were financed with approximately million in borrowings under the bank credit agreement  approximately million in proceeds from a unit offering of senior subordinated notes due in the notes and warrants to purchase shares of common stock at a price of per share  and approximately million in net proceeds received from the exercise of certain transferable rights to purchase  shares of common stock issued to the stockholders of the company 
financing provided under the bank credit agreement consisted of a million term loan facility  which was fully drawn at the closing of the acquisition  and a million revolving credit facility which also provides for a million letter of credit sub facility  under which approximately million was drawn in connection with the acquisition 
effective june   the bank credit agreement was amended  increasing the revolving credit facility to million 
borrowings under the term loan and the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate equal to bnp s base rate as defined plus per annum or bnp s eurodollar rate as defined and adjusted for reserves plus per annum  in either case as selected by health o meter 
health o meter s obligations under the bank credit agreement are secured by substantially all of health o meter s assets and a pledge of all of its issued and outstanding common stock 
health o meter s obligations under the bank credit agreement are also guaranteed by the company 
the term loan is subject to amortization on a quarterly basis in aggregate annual amounts of million  million  million  million  and million during fiscal through fiscal  respectively 
health o meter is required to make prepayments on the term loan and revolving credit facility with a percentage of excess cash flow as defined and of the proceeds from certain asset sales  issuances of debt and equity securities and extraordinary items outside the ordinary course of business 
the required term loan repayment for fiscal is million  which is included in the current portion of long term debt 
health o meter may also make optional prepayments  in full or in part  on the term loan 
health o meter is subject to certain customary affirmative and negative covenants contained in the bank credit agreement 
these include  without limitation  covenants that restrict  subject to certain exceptions  incurrence of additional indebtedness  mergers  consolidations or asset sales  changes in the nature of the business  granting of liens to secure any other indebtedness and transactions with affiliates 
in addition  the bank credit agreement requires that the company maintain certain specified financial ratios  including minimum interest and fixed charge coverage ratios  maximum leverage ratio  minimum net worth levels and ceilings on leverage and capital expenditures 
in order to reflect the impact of the seasonality of the company s business on its financial condition  relevant covenants in the bank credit agreement are set on a rolling twelve month basis 
at september   the company was in compliance with such covenants 
borrowing availability under the bank credit agreement at september  was million after considering outstanding letters of credit of million  actual borrowings of million  and sufficiency of collateral 
the notes are general obligations of health o meter and bear interest at the rate of per annum 
the interest on the notes is payable semi annually  in arrears  commencing on february  principal of the notes is payable on the maturity date  august  health o meter s payment obligations under the notes are unconditionally guaranteed by the company 
the notes and the company s guaranty are subordinated to the prior payment of all of the company s senior debt which includes amounts outstanding under the bank credit agreement 
the indenture governing the notes contains customary provisions restricting mergers  consolidations or sales of assets  issuances of preferred stock or the incurrence of additional indebtedness  payment of dividends  creation of liens and transactions with affiliates 
provided that certain financial tests are met  the indenture does not limit the amount of additional indebtedness that health o meter and its subsidiaries may incur 
the notes are generally not redeemable at the option of the company until august  subject to certain conditions  at any time through august   up to of the initial principal amount of the notes originally issued may be redeemed with the net proceeds of one or more public offerings of equity securities of the company or health o meter at a redemption price of of the principal amount thereof  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
under certain limited circumstances  health o meter may be required to use a portion of the proceeds from asset sales to make an offer to purchase a portion of the notes  at a price of of the principal amount thereof  together with accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  in the event of a change in control of health o meter generally defined to mean any transaction or series of transactions which results in persons other than the thomas h 
lee company  its affiliates and certain related entities acquiring beneficial ownership of more than of the total voting power of the company on a fully diluted basis  each holder will have the right to require health o meter to repurchase its notes at a price of of the principal amount thereof  together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon 
except for the foregoing circumstances  health o meter is not required to make mandatory redemption or sinking fund payments with respect to the notes 
the bank credit agreement currently prohibits health o meter from purchasing any notes prior to the expiration thereof and also provides that certain change in control events with respect to health o meter would constitute a default thereunder 
the company is a holding company with no independent operations and has no material assets other than its ownership of all of the outstanding stock of health o meter 
therefore  the company is dependent on the receipt of dividends and other distributions from health o meter and the proceeds from the sale of its capital stock to the extent that such proceeds are not required to be used to prepay outstanding indebtedness to fund any obligations that the company incurs 
the bank credit agreement prohibits  and the indenture restricts  the payment of dividends to the company by health o meter 
based upon current levels of operations  anticipated sales growth and plans for expansion  management believes that the company s cash flow from operations including favorable cost savings estimated to be achieved in the future  combined with borrowings available under the bank credit agreement  will be sufficient to enable the company to meet all of its cash operating requirements over both the short term and the longer term  including scheduled interest and principal payments  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
this expectation is predicated upon continued growth in revenues in the company s core businesses consistent with historical experience  achievement of operating cash flow margins consistent with historical experience  and the absence of significant increases in interest rates 
inflation increases in interest rates  the costs of materials and labor  and federal  state and local tax rates can significantly affect the company s operations 
management believes that the current practices of maintaining adequate operating margins through a combination of new product introductions  product differentiation  cost reduction  outsourcing  manufacturing and overhead expense control and careful management of working capital are its most effective tools for coping with inflation 
new accounting pronouncements during  the financial accounting standards board issued two pronouncements  neither of which the company has adopted  which are effective for financial statements for years beginning after december  the company has considered the requirements of statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and has determined that it will not require recognition of any impairment losses 
the company has also determined to remain within the accounting prescribed by apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly the implementation of statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation will result in additional disclosures without any impact on the statements of operations or financial condition
