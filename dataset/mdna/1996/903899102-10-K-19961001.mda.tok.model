general the company was formed in december on march   the company acquired certain technology and assets from kodak relating to the volt lithium manganese dioxide battery that was developed originally by kodak 
since its inception  the company has concentrated significant resources toward research and development activities related to its unique solid state system tm sss tm lithium ion rechargeable battery  the volt battery and other lithium based battery technologies 
the company has successfully modified the volt battery and is currently producing it in commercial quantities at its newark  new york facility 
the company has also begun marketing additional products  including a volt battery and thin cell batteries 
in addition  the company has shipped prototypes of its rechargeable batteries for testing to original equipment manufacturers and others 
rechargeable battery manufacturing equipment is planned for installation in newark  ny during the fourth calendar quarter of on june   a subsidiary of the company acquired certain assets and related business of dowty group plc  a leading manufacturer of lithium and sea water batteries based in abingdon  england 
for the fiscal year ended june  fiscal the results of operations in england were included for the entire year

future operating results may be affected by a wide range of factors and may fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the company reports the results of two business segments  battery sales and technology contracts 
technology contracts include technological and research and development services to government agencies and other third parties 
in fiscal  and  revenue from technology contracts represented approximately   and respectively  of the total revenues 
the company expects revenues from technology contracts as a percentage of total revenues to continue to decrease as battery sales increase and sales of technology to the china development program are completed

in the uk operations  battery sales declined primarily as a result of a fire which occurred during the year 
technology contract revenues declined as the company s contract relating to the establishment of a battery manufacturing facility in the peoples republic of china is in its final stage 
the cost of products sold increased to  for fiscal from  an increase of  or 
as a ratio to revenues  the cost of products sold was for fiscal and for fiscal cost of products sold related to battery sales increased to  or of revenues for fiscal compared to  or for fiscal manufacturing operations in the us improved slightly in fiscal compared to the prior year 
this net improvement occurred despite a production slowdown in the fourth fiscal quarter caused by reduced levels of battery sales 
in the u 
k  the cost of batteries sold increased substantially during fiscal when compared to primarily due to a fire during the year 
technology contract cost of products sold decreased to  or of revenues during fiscal from  or of revenues for the same period of the prior year

these payments had no associated cost of products sold 
total operating expenses increased to  for fiscal from  for the same period of the prior year  an increase of  or 
of this total  selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or due to additional costs to promote battery sales 
research and development increased to  during fiscal from  for fiscal  an increase of  or 
this increased cost is associated with continuing support of the company s rechargeable battery program
