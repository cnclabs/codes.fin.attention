item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary as a result of the company s activities in  it showed continued improvement in several key areas the company had significant discoveries in two fields through its drilling program  the company drilled and successfully completed eight oil wells in  resulting in a increase in its oil production and a increase in its boe reserves over levels  the company established a new line of credit with a commercial bank  which enabled it to terminate its enron production payment financing  and the company raised million from the issuance of laguna s preferred stock and associated warrants 
despite the progress made  four factors combined to generate a loss for the year first  gas sales suffered from lower production and low gas prices  second  additional interest expense was incurred in connection with the company s lines of credit  third  increased mining project expenses were incurred in relation to the ongoing rio chiquito project  and finally  general and administrative expenses were higher than in liquidity  capital resources and capital expenditures the company took several steps in to reduce its working capital deficit as of december  to  down from a deficit of  at december  on february   the company established a  line of credit with three private investors 
on august   the company refinanced this line of credit and its volumetric production payment obligation by establishing a  line of credit with a bank 
this  line of credit was subsequently replaced  on march   by a  line of credit the facility 
by i lowering borrowing costs  ii eliminating the company s production payment delivery obligations  iii providing a three month period of interest only debt service obligations  and iv providing a million over advance facility to be used specifically for an approved drilling program  these financing transactions are expected to enhance the company s working capital  cash flows and overall financial condition 
the significant terms of the facility are as follows the initial borrowing base is  subject to redetermination every six months  beginning june   the interest rate is the london interbank offered rate libor  plus  the facility requires a reduction in the commitment of  per month beginning on june   subject to the initial borrowing base redetermination  the facility provides for an additional  advance line of credit to be used solely for a development drilling program approved by the lender  this advance line is repayable through of the future net revenues generated by successful wells under the drilling program 
in addition  if borrowing base levels increase under the facility  such amounts must be borrowed and used to prepay amounts outstanding under the advance line 
in any event  any advance line balance must be repaid by september   the facility is collateralized by substantially all of the company s oil and gas properties  the company is obligated to maintain certain financial and other covenants including a minimum current ratio of to  minimum net equity requirement  and a debt coverage ratio  and the facility expires on march  with these important financial arrangements in place  the key to the long term resolution of the company s working capital situation is its drilling 
for  the company has budgeted for drilling one gross well approximately 
net per month 
the company has permitted  or is in the process of permitting  an additional development locations for drilling 
it will then evaluate further drilling based on the initial results 
drilling operations inevitably have an initial negative impact on the cash and working capital positions of the company as up front drilling expenditures are incurred 
on a longer term basis as reserves are produced these drilling efforts are designed to have net positive effects on cash flow and capital 
management believes that the ultimate result of the drilling activities  which are primarily aimed at oil production  will be to increase cash flow  thereby reducing the company s working capital deficit and increasing liquidity 
however  drilling activities are subject to numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive oil or gas reservoirs will be encountered 
also  sales from successfully drilled wells are affected by prevailing prices for oil and gas 
hydrocarbon prices can be extremely volatile and can substantially affect the company s revenues  cash flows and working capital 
there can be no assurance that the proceeds from the line of credit and drilling activities will eliminate the working capital deficit 
if they do not  the company will take other measures to improve its working capital position 
while it has no current intention to do so  management could reduce expenses through staff layoffs and other means of expense reduction  sell non core properties  or obtain additional sources of capital  if available 
additional drilling  and any acquisitions  would require additional capital 
beyond the facility  the source of any such capital is not yet known  nor are any acquisitions arranged 
if an acquisition is contracted  the company would expect to finance it with a combination of debt and equity capital  although the details of such financing cannot be predicted at this time 
in addition to its drilling programs  the company  from time to time  farms out non core properties or properties with a higher risk profile than the company is willing to accept 
one such farmout agreement in resulted in a significant gas discovery which began production in august another well has been drilled and is being tested for completion as of march  the company is also evaluating alternatives to realize the value of its mining properties 
during  laguna sold  shares of laguna series a convertible preferred stock the laguna series a stock  representing a equity stake in laguna 
the proceeds from this offering are being used to fund the development of laguna  including additional core drilling in costa rica in preparation of a pre feasibility study to expand mineable reserves on the rio chiquito anomaly located on laguna s costa rica concessions  and preparation of a pre feasibility study for commercial development of rio chiquito to be completed by the winters company of tucson  arizona in anticipation of making an initial public offering of laguna stock 
proceeds are also being used to fund day to day operations of laguna 
each share of laguna series a stock includes detachable warrants  each warrant represents the right to purchase one share of mallon s common stock at per share 
the warrants expire on february  each share of laguna series a stock can be converted into shares of laguna common stock at the option of the stockholder  or automatically in the event of a public offering of the common stock of laguna 
subsequent to yearend  laguna signed a letter of intent with a canadian underwriter for the sale of a minimum of  and a maximum of  units at a price of per unit 
each unit will include one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase one share of common stock  exercisable at per share for an month period 
laguna also agreed to grant the underwriter an option to purchase an additional  shares of common stock  exercisable at  also for an month period following the issuance of the common stock 
the company used net cash for operating activities of  in compared with  in included in these amounts are net losses of  and  for and  respectively 
non cash items added back include depreciation  depletion and amortization of  and  for and  respectively 
amortization of deferred revenues of  in and  in negatively impacted cash flow from operating activities 
the termination of the volumetric production payment reduced operating cash flows by a total of  including the gain of  the early retirement of the  line of credit resulted in an extraordinary loss of  other non cash items increasing operating cash flows were  and  in and  respectively 
changes in operating assets and liabilities decreased cash flows from operations by  in as accounts receivable increased 
changes in operating assets and liabilities increased cash flows from operating activities in by  primarily as a result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of investing activities used cash flows of  in compared with  in the company invested significantly more in its mining operations in  and continued reworking  recompleting  drilling and developing its oil and gas properties 
financing activities netted cash flows of  in  due primarily to two transactions described earlier the receipt of  as a result of its credit facility refinancing and  as a result of the issuance of laguna series a stock and the associated detachable warrants 
in  cash provided by financing activities netted the company  mainly due to proceeds from the sale of the company s series b mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred stock the series b stock of  of this amount   was used to retire the company s former net profits interest and accrued interest 
the other financing activity was the payment of the series b stock dividends   in and  in at december   the company had a working capital deficit of  compared with a deficit of  at december  the improvement in working capital was caused primarily by an increase in cash of  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and an increase in accounts receivable  inventory and other assets of  limiting mallon s ability to generate cash flows and positive working capital were low gas prices received in  especially in its san juan basin gas properties 
generally  prices are beyond the control of the company and it is limited in its ability to protect its economic interests from the effect of low prices  although the company may enter into contracts to reduce the risk of price fluctuations  as indicated below 
in november  the company entered into a collar hedging transaction with an independent crude oil buyer covering  barrels per month of its oil production 
under this arrangement  for each month beginning november through october  if the price for light sweet crude oil as quoted on the new york mercantile exchange nymex is less than per barrel  the company will receive the difference between and the average settlement price for that month for the  barrels subject to the collar agreement 
if the average settlement price exceeds per barrel  the company will pay the difference between and such average price on the  barrels 
the premium for this collar is per barrel  payable monthly 
also in november  the company entered into a floor hedging transaction with an independent crude oil buyer covering  mmbtus per month of the company s gas production 
under this arrangement  for each month beginning november through october  if the price for gas as quoted on the nymex is less than  the company will receive the difference between and the average settlement price for that month for the  mmbtus subject to the floor agreement 
the premium for this floor is 
per mmbtu  payable monthly 
results of operations the following table summarizes the revenues from oil and gas operations for the following years oil revenues    oil production bbl    average price per bbl gas revenues    gas production mcf    average price per mcf production and operating costs per boe depreciation  depletion and amortization per boe includes  bbls and  mcf in   bbls and  mcf in and  bbls and  mcf in delivered to enron pursuant to the terms of the volumetric production payment agreement see note to the consolidated financial statements 
compared to total revenues increased from  in to  or in of this increase   is the result of a gain recognized on the termination of the company s volumetric production payment 
because the volumetric production payment delivery obligation was terminated in august  deferred revenue amortization decreased to  down  or from  in in  it is expected that all of the company s production will result in cash sales to the company 
oil and gas sales in increased to  up from  in  representing a  increase or 
this increase is primarily due to the company s successful development program and the termination of the production payment  whereby quantities previously delivered to enron are now sold to third parties by the company 
total oil sales increased by  barrels or approximately 
reserve engineering forecasts indicate oil production of  barrels from proved developed producing reserves in this estimate does not include any incremental production which might result from the company s current development program 
management believes drilling activities will provide another increase in oil production 
average oil prices increased from per barrel in to per barrel in  a or increase 
gas production decreased from  mcf in to  mcf in  or by  mcf or due in part to a decrease in one of the company s producing properties 
one of the company s significant properties has a steep decline curve  accounting for  mcf of the production decrease 
reserve engineering forecasts indicate gas production of  mcf from proved developed producing reserves in before taking into account any new gas production which may come on line in average gas prices increased in by 
per mcf or 
included in total revenues for and are  and  respectively  from the amortization of deferred revenues 
these deferred revenues related to a volumetric production payment agreement with enron  which was terminated in august the deferred revenue was to be amortized over eight years as deliveries were made to the purchaser 
the company delivered approximately  mcf and  barrels in and  mcf and  barrels in under the production payment 
the company incurred all costs related to the production and delivery of these quantities 
as a result of the termination  the company recognized a gain of  for the difference between the book value of deferred revenues and the amount paid to terminate the production payment obligation 
lease operating expenses per equivalent barrel averaged in  compared with in on a per barrel basis  management expects lease operating expenses to decline in there were no sales of gold and silver in or  and no income is expected in the immediate future 
costs related to the mining operation were  in  a significant  or increase over  in the proceeds from the laguna series a stock offering are being used to fund development of laguna s activities in costa rica 
the program there includes additional core drilling to further delineate the rio chiquito ore body and possibly expand mineable reserves 
as a result of these activities  mining project expenses increased in  and will continue to do so in  and cash flow decreased 
the long term impact of the laguna development should be to add value and to increase cash flows to the company 
depreciation  depletion and amortization rose slightly in to per barrel of oil equivalent  an increase of 
per barrel from as of december   the net book value of the company s oil and gas properties exceeded the net present value of the underlying reserves by  however  oil and gas prices have increased substantially subsequent to yearend 
applying these increased prices to yearend oil and gas reserves indicates that the oil and gas properties were not  in fact  impaired 
accordingly  the  impairment was not charged to expense during the year ended december  interest and other expense of  was up significantly  or in as the company incurred interest on its lines of credit 
the increase is the result of interest incurred on borrowings under the company s lines of credit  such borrowings were incurred to terminate the volumetric production payment 
management expects that net cash flow will increase in as sales to the company of volumes previously delivered to enron will more than offset the full year effect of interest expense under the company s lines of credit 
management expects interest expense to increase in  as the new facility will be outstanding for the entire year 
total general and administrative costs were  in  an increase of  or over the  in of this increase   was expensed as investment banking fees related to a contract which expired in salaries for two officers hired april  were included for the full year in in  consulting fees related to laguna s exploration program also significantly increased general and administrative expenses 
travel and related expenses increased in because of expenditures incurred in pursuing the laguna private placement  for travel related to the financing transactions  and for new personnel traveling to costa rica for the mining program 
these increases are offset by the company s efforts to reduce its overhead 
while reductions were made in several areas  legal fees  specifically  decreased by more than  and general office expenses were reduced by approximately  the company paid the dividend on its  face value series b stock 
this amount totaled  in and  for the period from april  to december  the annual dividend is  payable in quarterly installments of  related accretion on the series b stock was  for the year ended december  compared to the company used net cash for operating activities of  in compared with generating  in included in these amounts are net losses of  and  for and  respectively 
also included are non cash charges for these net losses is depreciation  depletion and amortization of  in compared with  in amortization of deferred revenue of  in and  in negatively impacted cash flow from operating activities 
in  proceeds from the volumetric production payment increased cash from operating activities by  other non cash items were  and  in and  respectively 
an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  in increased cash flows from operating activities  whereas increases in accounts receivable and other assets of  decreased available cash flows 
the company s investing activities used cash flows of  in compared with  in in  mallon s oil and gas operations involved reworking  recompleting and developing properties

the financial results of operations from january  to september  of the acquired properties were recorded as a reduction of the purchase price 
financing activities netted cash flows of  in  primarily from the sale of the company s series b stock  which resulted in net proceeds of  dividends on the series b stock totaled  also impacting cash flows provided by financing activities was repayment of the company s net profits interest and accrued interest in the amount of  which eliminated this obligation 
in  financing activities provided cash flows of  reflecting the sale of  of the company s common stock  proceeds from the exercise of options of  and the sale of the net profits interest of  the payment of  on the company s note payable  and payments on long term debt  decreased cash provided by financing activities 
exclusive of quantities delivered pursuant to the company s volumetric production payment  oil and gas sales increased to  from  in  representing a  or increase 
this increase is due primarily to the september property acquisition  and drilling and enhancement operations completed during oil production net to mallon increased by  barrels or approximately 
not included in the above oil production totals are  barrels in and  barrels in which were delivered to enron in accordance with the terms of the volumetric production payment 
average oil prices increased from per barrel in to per barrel in natural gas production net to mallon increased by  mcf or in natural gas production in totaled  mcf  of which  mcf were delivered to meet the production payment obligation 
in  natural gas production totaled  mcf   mcf were delivered to enron 
in addition  output was curtailed in the company s burns ranch area  further reducing gas production for the company s account 
average gas prices increased in by 
per mcf or 
included in total revenues for is  from the amortization of the company s deferred revenues 
deferred revenues were recorded from the sale of a volumetric production payment covering approximately mmbtu of gas and  barrels of oil 
the deferred revenue is amortized over eight years as deliveries are made to the purchaser 
the company delivered approximately  mcf and  barrels to enron in the company incurs all costs related to the production and delivery of these quantities 
further limiting the company s ability to generate cash flows was the fact that certain of the company s significant wells  including the mobil  the white baby comm 
and  the eddy federal  and the allied federal  were shut in during the first part of while production enhancement operations were performed 
also  the south carlsbad compressor was out of service during most of the first quarter 
lease operating expense per equivalent barrel averaged in  compared with in the decrease of per barrel or was due primarily to the lower operating costs on the acquired properties and operational efficiencies employed by the company 
this reduction occurred despite substantial costs for significant workovers and repairs on the company s properties in there were no sales of gold and silver in or  and no sales are expected in the immediate future 
the company recognized management fees of  associated with the newmont operation in this agreement expired as of march  direct costs related to the mining operation were  in and  in depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to per barrel of oil equivalent for  up from in the increase of or partially reflects a decrease in production in one of the company s major properties and the effect of low yearend gas prices on reserves 
as of december   the net book value of the company s oil and gas properties exceeded the net present value of the underlying reserves by  however  oil and gas prices increased subsequent to yearend 
applying these increased prices to yearend oil and gas reserves indicated that the oil and gas properties were not  in fact  impaired 
accordingly  the  impairment was not charged to expense during the year ended december  interest and other expense of  was down significantly in  was incurred in  as the company incurred interest at on its net profits interest in the net profits interest was retired in april total general and administrative costs were  in  an increase of  or over the  for the increase is due mainly to increased salary expense for additional personnel directly related to the september acquisition 
legal fees increased significantly  as the company was plaintiff in a complex lawsuit in which it sought substantial damages
