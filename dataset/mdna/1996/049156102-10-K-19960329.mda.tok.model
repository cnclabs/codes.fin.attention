item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations atlantis is a leading us manufacturer of polyethylene stretch and custom films used in a variety of industrial and consumer applications and molded plastic products for the appliance  agricultural  automotive  recreational vehicle  residential window  and dairy and industrial container industries 
discontinued operations in and consisted of the operations of western pioneer  the company s california property casualty insurance subsidiary which was sold on august  prior to  discontinued operations included both western pioneer and the company s interest in loewenstein furniture  inc loewenstein  now known as winsloew furniture  inc winsloew 
see note as more fully described in item business  during the company s new senior management group developed and implemented a strategic operating plan which focuses on achieving a number of objectives during and the primary objectives of the strategic operating plan are i to reduce the company s fixed and variable costs  ii to reconfigure its stretch film sales organization  iii to exit non strategic businesses  and iv to better manage its assets and reduce its indebtedness 
the implementation of certain aspects of the strategic operating plan caused the company to incur various nonrecurring costs during  which have been segregated within the impairment of long lived assets and other restructuring charges categories of the accompanying income statement 
sales  gross profit  and operating income loss for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands year ended december  sales amount total amount total amount total atlantis plastic films    atlantis molded plastics    total    gross profit amount sales amount sales amount sales atlantis plastic films    atlantis molded plastics    total    operating income loss amount sales amount sales amount sales atlantis plastic films    atlantis molded plastics    total   comparison of years ended december  and sales the company s sales of million were ahead of last year s sales  with the sales growth occurring primarily within atlantis plastic films due to higher average selling prices  partially offset by a decline in volume compared to atlantis plastic films sales for totalled million  ahead of last year s film sales of million 
during the last nine months of  plastic resin prices increased by over  causing film product demand to rise beyond normal levels as customers increased inventories in order to avoid purchases at anticipated higher selling prices 
during the second quarter of  the film market  anticipating resin price declines  experienced a significant weakening in demand as customers postponed purchases in order to reduce abnormally high inventories created during the preceding period and to maximize product purchases at expected future lower prices 
resin prices started declining in june  and fell approximately from early june through december  and a further from december through february a price increase of was recently announced by the company s suppliers of plastic resin 
unless withdrawn  this increase will affect the company s resin purchases starting in april  atlantis molded plastics sales during of million exceeded last year s million by  with a slight decline in sales for the company s injection molding unit  offset by increased sales within the profile extrusion and blow molding units 
the lack of sales growth within the injection molding unit was caused by several factors  including i a decline in sales of refrigeration related parts compared to last year  and ii the effects of a negotiated price reduction with a major customer 
gross profits the company s gross profit of million  or of sales  declined sharply both in dollar and percentage terms from the gross profit of million  or of sales 
the decline was due primarily to the adverse impact of the film inventory correction described above  the adverse effects of an extremely competitive stretch film market during  and lower injection molding profitability compared with last year 
atlantis plastic films posted gross profit of million  or of sales  compared to last year s gross profit of million  or of sales 
the second and third quarter customer inventory correction and resulting decline in demand reduced sales volume in pounds  and also reduced selling prices due to competitive market pressures 
weak market demand during this time period caused selling prices to drop more rapidly than plastic resin costs 
as a result  during the differential between film selling prices and plastic resin costs the major raw material component of the company s film products declined compared to film gross profits also continued to be affected by inefficiencies at the tulsa  oklahoma custom film facility 
in order to reduce fixed overhead and increase profitability at the tulsa custom film facility  during the fourth quarter of the tulsa custom film facility was downsized  making it a satellite of the cartersville  georgia custom facility and transferring certain of its production volume to the mankato  minnesota and the cartersville custom film facilities 
film market conditions remain extremely competitive and continue to exert downward pressure on film volume and selling prices  causing film volumes and selling price resin cost differentials to remain depressed compared to the first quarter of however  the various cost reduction programs initiated during  including the company wide reduction in salaried headcount and the downsizing of the tulsa custom film facility  are expected to lower overhead costs and variable costs of manufacturing within atlantis plastic films during the coming year when compared to the atlantis molded plastics gross profit of million  or of sales  decreased substantially compared to last year s gross profit of million  or of sales 
this decline in profitability resulted primarily from a variety of factors within the injection molding unit  including the decline in sales and price reduction described above  manufacturing inefficiencies within certain phases of the production process  and unusually high overtime due to these manufacturing inefficiencies 
the atlantis molded plastics gross profit was also adversely impacted by lower blow molding profitability  partially offset by stronger profile extrusion gross profits compared to in order to address the injection molding issues described above  the company implemented a number of personnel and process improvement changes during the fourth quarter of the company s injection molding unit significantly reduced overtime and salaried headcount  initiated continuous operations at its henderson  kentucky facility this change is scheduled for implementation at the remaining injection molding facilities during the first half of  and initiated the decentralization of its engineering and administrative functions which were formerly conducted only at the henderson facility 
these changes have already begun to yield positive results  and as these changes become fully integrated  they are expected to lower operating costs  improve operating efficiency and control  and increase throughput 
the decline in blow molding profitability resulted from continued competitive pricing pressures within the dairy plastic container markets 
however  during the fourth quarter of blow molding profit margins improved due to increases in sales of industrial containers  combined with reductions in manufacturing costs 
as more fully discussed in item  business  the company sold its blow molding joint venture interest during for gross proceeds of  and recognized an after tax gain on the sale of approximately  during january  the company also announced its plans to sell plastic containers  inc  its remaining blow molding business 
the company s profile extrusion unit posted record sales and profitability during compared to  and once again achieved operating margins in excess of 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a equaled million  or of sales  compared to last year s sg a of million  or of sales 
the dollar and percentage decrease in sg a for was primarily caused by lower incentive compensation expense resulting from the decline in profitability  and a reduction in salaried headcount 
sg a expense during includes approximately  recorded during the third quarter representing an increase in the reserve for bad debts related to a potentially uncollectable account receivable within the injection molding unit 
the various cost reduction programs initiated by the company during  including the company wide reduction in salaried headcount  the reconfiguration of the stretch film sales organization  and the restructuring of the tulsa custom film facility and the injection molding unit  are expected to reduce sg a during the coming year when compared to impairment of long lived assets and restructuring charges as more fully discussed in notes and  during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in connection with the adoption of this statement  during the fourth quarter of the company recorded noncash charges of approximately million for the impairment of long lived assets associated with the tulsa custom film facility  and for the reduction in carrying value of the company s blow molding unit in connection with its proposed sale 
of this amount  goodwill writeoffs equaled approximately million with no associated tax benefit  and fixed asset writedowns equaled approximately million pre tax  or million after tax 
during  the company also incurred restructuring charges of approximately million related to i the first quarter reorganization of its senior management group approximately  ii the third and fourth quarter reconfiguration of its stretch film sales organization approximately  and iii the fourth quarter headcount reduction costs associated with the restructuring of the tulsa custom facility and the injection molding unit approximately 
net interest expense and taxes net interest expense increased from million in to million in  primarily due to the higher debt balances maintained during the first half of the significant reduction in debt achieved during the second half of has reduced net interest expense  with net interest expense for the fourth quarter of of million  compared to million during the fourth quarter of and million during the second quarter of based upon the reduction in outstanding indebtedness achieved during the second half of  assuming market interest rates remain constant  management anticipates a continued reduction in net interest expense compared to the interest expense levels experienced during the first half of the company s effective tax rates during and were affected by nondeductible goodwill amortization  with the tax rate also affected by the tax impact of the september sale of the company s interest in the cks rigal blow molding joint venture 
discontinued operations and extraordinary gain western pioneer was sold to a massachusetts based property and casualty insurance company on august  for million 
the after tax gain recognized on the sale of western pioneer was approximately  see note western pioneer s loss from operations for the period prior to its sale during totaled  compared to its income from operations of million 
the decline in income was due to i a significant increase in new policies during  with new business historically less profitable than continuing business  and ii poorer than normal weather conditions during the winter of  which caused an increase in accidents and claims during during december  the company repurchased million of its senior notes in the open market  and recognized an extraordinary gain of  net of tax 
net income loss as a result of the factors described above  particularly the impact of the impairment of long lived assets and other restructuring charges  and the decline in gross profit  the net loss equaled million  or per share  compared to last year s net income of million  or per share 
the loss from continuing operations equaled million  or per share  compared to income from continuing operations of million  or per share for the year ended comparison of years ended december  and sales the company s sales of million were ahead of sales by  due to higher selling prices during resulting from a significant increase in resin prices during the last nine months of  and also due to increases in sales volume in both the film and injection molding operating units 
in addition  sales include incremental sales volume resulting from added capacity created by the company s and capital expansion programs  and the contribution from the may acquisition of advanced plastics  inc advanced  an injection molder located in warren  ohio 
see note of notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
gross profits the increase in sales resulted in higher gross profit dollar levels compared to  while gross profit as a percentage of sales remained constant at of sales for the and periods 
during  gross profit equaled million  compared to the prior year s gross profit of million 
for atlantis plastic films  the gross profit percentage of improved compared to the gross profit percentage of  reflecting stronger profitability in the custom film unit resulting from improved plant efficiencies combined with lower scrap rates  which served to offset the margin pressure experienced as a result of the significant increase in resin prices during the period 
the atlantis molded plastics gross profit percentage of decreased from the gross profit percentage of 
this decrease reflects lower injection molding profitability resulting from a variety of factors  including i a higher level of tooling sales during  which produced lower margins in comparison to the normal product line  ii additional expenses related to debugging costs of new tools  which were placed in service in late or during  iii higher subcontracted and overtime labor costs due to the shortage of qualified labor resulting from low national unemployment levels during  iv unfavorable product mix  and v a decline in blow molding profitability due to ongoing competitive pricing pressures in the dairy plastic container markets 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a during totaled million  or of sales  compared to sg a of million  also of sales 
the dollar increase in sg a for reflected additional employees to support volume growth  higher costs in the injection molding unit  which included the operating results of advanced since may  and higher commission costs in the stretch film unit resulting from increased sales volume 
net interest expense and taxes net interest expense during of million was higher than the million in net interest expense for however  excluding interest income  interest expense was comparable at million and million  respectively  during and these amounts were comparable despite the increase in indebtedness and interest rates during  primarily due to the company s lower cost of capital resulting from the refinancing of substantially all of its indebtedness during the first quarter of the company s effective tax rates during and were affected by nondeductible goodwill amortization 
discontinued operations western pioneer s income totaled million  compared to income of  losses and loss adjustment expenses during of million equaled of premiums earned  compared to during the decrease was primarily due to improved collections of salvage and subrogation  combined with an increase in the estimate of salvage and subrogation receivable 
net income as a result of the factors described above  net income for equaled million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per share 
income from continuing operations during equaled million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in liquidity and capital resources the company s working capital at december  totaled approximately million  compared to million at december  cash totaled million at december   compared to million at december  as of december   the company amended certain revolving credit facility covenants and implemented a revolving credit availability formula which provides for gross availability on the credit facility  prior to any borrowings or reductions for outstanding letters of credit  of between million and million based upon the company s ratio of cash flow to total indebtedness  as defined in the amendment 
at december  the gross availability on the revolving credit facility equaled million  and the unused availability equaled million  net of approximately million for outstanding letters of credit 
there were no revolver borrowings outstanding as of december  various financial covenants contained within certain of the other senior obligations outstanding as of december  were also amended in a manner consistent with the amendments to the revolving credit facility described above 
see note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
as further discussed in note  the company s series a convertible preferred stock preferred stock entitles the holder to an annual cumulative dividend  payable in equal semiannual installments of  on april and october of each year 
as discussed below within liquidity  the company is prohibited from paying preferred dividends until it is able to meet the interest coverage ratio requirement relating to its senior notes on a trailing four quarters basis 
in the event that three or more dividend payments are in arrears on the preferred stock  the holders of the preferred stock have the right to elect one director of the company 
cash flows from operating activities during the second quarter of  as film demand began to soften and resin price decreases appeared imminent  the company focused on the reduction of inventories  accounts receivable and outstanding indebtedness 
this program  along with the effects of the resin price declines experienced during  resulted in significant declines in these areas from the levels maintained during late and early during  net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million  compared to million during the net loss was million  offset by the noncash provision for the impairment of long lived assets of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and the decrease in accounts receivable and inventories of million due to the reduction programs initiated by the company during the second quarter  as described above  and a lower level of film sales volume and selling prices 
accounts payable and accrued expenses at december  decreased by million compared to the year end balance primarily due to lower incentive compensation and capital expenditures accruals compared to year end the company s management expects that  given the significant working capital reductions achieved in the last nine months of  future working capital fluctuations will not be as significant and will correspond to the company s future sales levels 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities during equaled approximately  consisting of the proceeds from the august and september  sales of western pioneer see note and the company s interest in the cks rigal blow molding joint venture  for gross proceeds of million and  respectively  offset by capital expenditures of million 
capital expenditures decreased during compared with capital expenditures of million  and the company expects capital expenditures to be lower than cash used in investing activities during equaled million  comprised primarily of capital expenditures  and funds used to acquire the assets of advanced of million see note for information regarding the company s purchase of advanced in may 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities during equaled million  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million during from may  through mid may  total debt outstanding steadily increased due to i higher inventory and accounts receivable balances associated with higher sales levels and raw material costs compared to the first half of  ii revolver borrowings required to finance the may acquisition of advanced  and iii borrowings in connection with equipment financing programs established during and total debt was reduced from million at year end and a high of million in mid may to million at year end  primarily due to the previously described reductions in inventories and accounts receivable  along with the sales of western pioneer and the cks rigal joint venture interest 
outstanding indebtedness was also reduced by the company s december  repurchases  at a discount  of million of its senior notes 
other principal payments on long term debt of approximately million were also made during the year 
net borrowings on the company s revolving credit facility were reduced by approximately million during  with the unused availability on the company s revolving credit line favorably impacted by the events described above  and also by the refinancing of outstanding indebtedness from the revolving credit line to borrowings collateralized by certain equipment acquired during and  and collateralized by advanced s property  equipment  inventories and accounts receivable 
during  million of these borrowings were established 
during the period from january to october  the company paid dividends on common and preferred stock of approximately  for the reasons cited below  the company discontinued its cents per share quarterly common stock dividend program after the october dividend payment 
also see the discussion above regarding the company s ability to make future required preferred stock dividend payments 
liquidity during the last half of and the first half of  the company utilized equipment financing programs to finance the majority of its capital expenditures 
covenants relating to the company s senior notes indebtedness restrict the company from taking certain actions unless specified interest coverage ratio and other tests are met 
the company s recent decline in operating profitability caused it to fall below the interest coverage ratio requirement for the trailing four quarters ended september and december   and  accordingly  the company cannot pay dividends and its ability to incur new debt or take certain other actions is restricted in certain respects until it is again able to meet the interest coverage ratio requirement on a trailing four quarters basis 
however  notwithstanding the foregoing restrictions  the company is fully permitted to i borrow available funds on its revolving credit facility  and to ii incur new debt in connection with the refinancing of existing debt and certain other types of financings 
the company s primary needs for liquidity  on both a short and long term basis  relate to working capital principally inventory and accounts receivable  debt service and capital expenditures 
the company presently does not have any material commitments for future capital expenditures  and expects to meet its short and long term liquidity needs with funds generated from continuing operations  along with funds available under its revolving credit facility 
accounting pronouncements as previously discussed  during the fourth quarter of  the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of see notes and 
in october  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation was issued 
sfas introduces a preferable fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
it encourages  but does not require  companies to recognize compensation expense for grants of stock  stock options  and other equity instruments to employees based on the new fair value accounting rules 
although expense recognition for employee stock based compensation is not mandatory  sfas no 
requires companies that choose not to adopt the new fair value accounting rules to make certain proforma disclosures 
sfas no 
must be implemented no later than fiscal year the company has not yet determined the method or effect on operating results of implementing the statement 
however  the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a materially adverse effect on consolidated financial position
