item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto  under item of this annual report on form k 
overview since its formation in july  the company s long distance volume has grown to more than million monthly minutes at june  substantially all of the company s revenues have been derived from the sale of long distance services to small business customers 
the source of these accounts is primarily the company s nationwide network of independent marketing agents and the acquisition of customer accounts of other resellers 
many of these agents actively market the company s long distance products via telemarketing 
the company s primary expense  its costs of sales  is variable and consists of the underlying wholesale cost of long distance services from its underlying providers  commissions to independent agents  and billing costs 
however  in the opinion of the company  to the extent that revenues continue to grow  continued incremental economies may be achieved in the company s expenses  particularly the costs of long distance service and billing 
the company has grown by adding independent marketing agents and by acquiring the customer accounts of several other resellers 
the company acquires customer accounts from certain of its independent marketing agents on an individual price per order basis  allowing the company to use the agents as a vehicle to outsource telemarketing activities 
costs associated with individually acquired orders totaled approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the company expects that future revenue growth will come primarily from the continued development of independent marketing agents and additional acquisitions of customer accounts 
the company s selling  general and administrative costs are primarily the costs of back office operations and customer service 
the company also has devoted significant resources to the development of the information technology necessary to support customer service and the network of independent marketing agents 
netbase is a proprietary software system designed to provide efficient order provisioning and access to customer account information 
the company s operations and customer service efforts depend on netbase  which serves as the interface between the company and its independent marketing agents 
the company plans to continue to develop and enhance this system 
in the company began development of a new customer management information system  the netbase plus r operating system netbase plus 
in the second quarter of fiscal  the company implemented netbase plus  which the company determined to have inherent design flaws that resulted in inefficient operation 
the entire system was subsequently abandoned  and the company reverted from netbase plus to netbase in april as a result  the company wrote off approximately million in capitalized software development costs associated with the netbase plus system in the third quarter of fiscal the company expects the reversion to the original netbase to reduce cash outlays that were required to service  maintain and modify the netbase plus system  as well as decrease depreciation expense in the future by approximately  per month 
the company reported for federal income tax purposes as an s corporation under the internal revenue code of  as amended  until its reorganization in connection with its initial public offering in march  and was similarly treated for state income tax purposes under comparable state laws 
results of operations the following table sets forth for the fiscal periods indicated the percentages of total sales represented by certain items reflected in the company s consolidated statements of income and expenses percentage of total revenues fiscal year ended june  total sales cost of sales gross margin selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization write down of long term assets operating income loss other income expense interest income interest expense miscellaneous income loss before federal income taxes and extraordinary item provision benefit for federal income taxes income loss before extraordinary item extraordinary item net income loss year ended june   compared to year ended june  total sales 
long distance sales increased  from million in fiscal to million for the year ended june  the increase resulted from the significant growth of customer minutes in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal that continued into fiscal quarterly revenues peaked in the first quarter of fiscal at million and declined each quarter thereafter  with fourth quarter revenues totalling million in fiscal the decline in revenues during fiscal was more gradual than the growth in fiscal  resulting in an overall increase when comparing the two fiscal years 
the decline in revenues on a quarterly basis in fiscal was the result of an increased rate of attrition on existing customers and a decline in order activity in the last half of fiscal total cost of sales 
the company s cost of sales  which is variable  increased from million in fiscal to million for the year ended june   an increase of 
this increase was a result of an increase in the company s sales 
the company s cost of long distance which is a component of cost of sales remained relatively stable as a percentage of sales  decreasing slightly from to for the years ended june  and  respectively 
commission expense as a percentage of sales decreased from to 
this decrease in commissions was the result of a change in the company s sales strategy from that of advancing commissions to independent marketing agents for individual customer accounts  to one of purchasing customer accounts and bases of customer accounts 
the purchased bases and accounts have no associated commission expense 
in addition  the company made a payment in the second quarter of fiscal to a principal agent to reduce the agent s commission rate 
of the company s total sales during fiscal and  and  respectively  were derived from customers introduced to the company from this agent 
billing expense as a percentage of sales increased from to  a result of the average monthly customer bill decreasing from per month to per month and the increase in the number of delinquent accounts 
bad debt expense increased from of sales in fiscal year to of sales in fiscal a primary factor to the increase in bad debt expense incurred by the company was the result of the shift to more purchased orders for which the company had full exposure to uncollectible accounts as compared to commissioned orders for which the agents shared in a substantial portion of the risk on uncollectible accounts 
in addition  the company s collection efforts were hindered by the failure of netbase plus to produce the necessary information to allow for the most timely and effective method of collection 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the same period in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from to for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in this expense was a result of the substantial growth of the company over the last half of fiscal and through december total staff increased from an average of temporary and permanent employees during the year ended june  at june   to an average of temporary and permanent employees during the year ended june  staffing peaked in december at employees including temporary employees and declined to temporary and permanent employees in june salary related expense increased million as a result of the increase in personnel 
lease expense increased from  in fiscal to million in fiscal the company entered into two significant sale leaseback transactions totalling million during fiscal additionally  the company leased a new telephone system and computer equipment to support the company s information system network 
the company incurred approximately  in additional legal  accounting and professional fees in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the added cost of being a public company for all of fiscal  the significant level of attempted acquisition activity in the first half of fiscal  the joint venture with metrolink  inc metrolink  and the renegotiation of the company s loan agreement with its principal lender in november and amendments to that agreement in march and june depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the same period for the year ended june  amortization expense has increased substantially because of the purchase of a customer base in june for million and the investment of million in fiscal in individual orders purchased from independent marketing agents 
depreciation expense has risen over the same periods as a result of the significant investment in computers needed to support the company s growth and as a result of the investment in netbase plus 
the company wrote down assets during the year ended june   of approximately million 
included in the write down were a million non cash charge to reduce the carrying value of acquired customer bases to the present value of the expected future cash flows associated with the underlying customer accounts and a million write off of capitalized software development costs associated with the netbase plus system 
the write down of deferred acquisition costs was necessitated by continued greater than expected turnover of acquired customer bases which resulted from difficulties in billing and servicing the underlying customer accounts 
during fiscal  the company reverted from the netbase plus operating system which was implemented in november  to the company s original netbase operating system 
the company determined that the netbase plus system had inherent design flaws which resulted in inefficient operation and abandoned the entire system in april the company expects the reversion to the original netbase to reduce cash outlays that were required to service  maintain and modify the netbase plus system  as well as decrease depreciation expense in the future by approximately  per month 
operating income loss 
operating income decreased from million for the year ended june   to an operating loss of million for fiscal other income expense 
other expense increased from  for fiscal to million for the year ended june  this increase was primarily attributable to a decrease in interest income of  from fiscal to fiscal and an increase in miscellaneous expense of  the decrease in interest income was the result of the use during fiscal of the excess cash generated through the company s initial public offering in march miscellaneous expense in fiscal includes a  accrual for possible penalties  settlement costs and legal expenses associated with the resolution of pending complaints against the company by various state regulatory agencies with regard to customer complaints 
see item  legal proceedings 
interest expense increased as a result of an increase in the size and utilization of borrowings under the company s line of credit during the year ended june  year ended june   compared to year ended june  total sales 
long distance sales increased  from million in fiscal to million for the fiscal ended june  approximately of this increase arose from sales to new customers 
the increase related primarily to continued expansion of the company s network of independent marketing agents as well as increases in the number of orders submitted by the company s existing independent marketing agents 
a price increase of in june also was responsible for a proportionate share of the increase in sales in the period  with existing customer usage remaining relatively stable 
total cost of sales 
the company s cost of sales  which is variable  increased from million in fiscal to million for the year ended june   an increase of 
this increase was a result of an increase in the company s sales 
the company s cost of long distance which is a component of cost of sales decreased as a percentage of sales from to for the years ended june  and  respectively 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the cost of commissions to the company s independent marketing agents from to of sales for these same periods 
bad debts and billing costs increased from  to  and from to million  respectively  but remained relatively constant as a percentage of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the same period in fiscal the increase was a result of the substantial growth of the company 
total staff increased from to in the twelve months ended june  with a corresponding increase in salary related costs of million 
the growth in personnel necessitated expansion of office facilities and lease related expenses increased  from fiscal significant costs were also incurred to service the increase in customers experienced in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales remained relatively constant between fiscal and at and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased from  in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of the increase in customer acquisition costs and property  plant and equipment 
operating income 
operating income increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the same fiscal period in other income expense 
other income expense declined from  in income for fiscal to  in expense for the year ended june  this decline was primarily attributable to other income earned from an incentive payment related to an inbound traffic commitment during fiscal  which was not present during fiscal interest expense increased as a result of an increase in the size and utilization of the company s line of credit for the year ended june  this increase was more than offset in fiscal by the increase in interest income resulting from the increase in cash due to increased profitability and the initial public offering completed in march liquidity and capital resources the company generated pre tax net income of million and million for the years ended june  and  respectively  and recorded an million pre tax loss for the year ended june  the company funded its operations during the year ended june   with the remaining proceeds of its initial public offering which closed in march  through advances under its revolving credit facility and through operating cash flows 
by december   the remaining funds from the initial public offering had been expended  and  due to operating losses sustained in the second half of fiscal and a declining revenue base  the company reached its maximum borrowing capacity under its revolving credit facility 
the company s borrowing capacity under this credit facility continues to decline as a result of operating losses  a decline in the revenue base and the exclusion of certain receivables from the criteria of eligible receivables 
an additional source of liquidity during this time period has been an extension of payment terms from the company s major suppliers  although there can be no assurance that any such extensions will be granted in the future 
at current levels of operations and with a declining borrowing base  the company must seek additional capital and continued concessions from its vendors and must continue to reduce expenses to bring them in line with current levels of revenues 
cash flow from operations 
the company used net cash of  in operating activities in fiscal while operating activities provided net cash of  in fiscal cash from net income adjusted for non cash expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in the net use of cash resulting from the change in operating assets and liabilities  primarily the million increase in commissions advanced to agents and a million change in accounts payable and accrued expenses offset by the decrease in accounts receivable of million  was million in fiscal accounts receivable and payables  particularly the payable to providers of long distance  decreased as revenues declined in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal cash flow was also negatively affected by the company s change in policy related to the timing of payment of commissions 
beginning in fiscal  the company began paying commissions based upon revenue billed while prior to that time commissions were paid on revenues collected 
in addition  the company paid approximately million in federal and state sales taxes owed for prior periods as a result of the company s inadvertent failure to remit the sales tax due to various taxing authorities on the incremental component of revenue in excess of the cost of the underlying service for which taxes were properly paid 
cash flow from investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal during fiscal the company purchased million of customer accounts 
the company expended million for computer equipment and related software development 
the increase in personnel and back office development through december required a substantial investment in office computer equipment 
funds were also utilized to implement the netbase plus customer management information system which required investment in hardware and proprietary software  while additional funds were expended to revert back to  modify and improve the original netbase system 
the company invested  in property and equipment related to expanded facilities 
the company also invested  in a proprietary in house billing system 
the company anticipates implementing the system for selected segments of the company s business in the second quarter of fiscal and internally billing the majority of its customers by the end of fiscal the company also made a one time payment of  to one of its largest agents to reduce the agent s commission rate on existing traffic 
financing activities 
financing activities provided million to the company in fiscal the company increased borrowings under the revolving credit facility during fiscal  resulting in net proceeds of million an additional million was provided by the sale of computer equipment and furniture owned by the company  which the company subsequently leased from the purchaser 
working capital and long cash cycle 
customer billings for long distance services are generated from detailed call records which are generally available from the carrier on or about the tenth day of the month following the month of customer usage 
customer invoices usually are generated within ten days thereafter and are due by the th day following the month of customer usage 
however  the company historically collects a large portion of receivables after the scheduled due date  resulting in an average cash cycle of approximately days 
since the company s primary underlying carrier is paid within days following the month of usage  delays in receipt of customer payments have resulted in significant working capital needs 
sales taxes 
in early  the company determined that its treatment and disbursement of sales taxes was not being properly administered and engaged an outside tax compliance firm to assist in the resolution of the matter with the various states and other regulatory and taxing authorities at june   the company has accrued  for resolution of this matter 
the improper treatment of sales taxes arose from the company s failure to remit the sales tax due to various taxing authorities on the incremental component of revenue in excess of the cost of the underlying service for which taxes were properly paid 
the company believes that the amount accrued is adequate for the satisfaction of this tax liability  including any interest and penalties payable 
historical capital resources 
to date  the external funds necessary to fund the company s capital requirements arising from capital expenditures  acquisitions and working capital have been provided primarily from bank credit financing and the proceeds from the company s initial public offering 
maximum borrowings under the company s line of credit has increased from  in to million in the company s current credit facility provides for a borrowing base that is dependent upon the amount and aging of accounts receivable 
as of june   the borrowing base under the existing facility was estimated to be million 
under this facility  the interest on the outstanding balance accrues at a rate equal to prime plus at june  
interest was payable at prime plus from june   through september   with the remaining deferred interest for that period due and payable on october  under this facility  the interest accrues and is payable monthly at a rate equal to prime plus beginning october  at october  
the existing credit facility expires december   and is secured by the company s accounts receivable 
as of june   approximately  of borrowings were available under the credit facility 
the company s agreement with at t establishes minimum semi annual revenue commitments msarcs which must be met to receive the contractual price set forth in the agreement and to avoid shortfall penalties 
msarcs are segregated into components differentiated by the type of traffic 
at june   the company was million below the cumulative msarc 
if the existing contract with at t is terminated  either by the company or by at t for non payment  prior to the expiration of the full term without execution of a new contract  the company will be liable for the total amount of the unsatisfied msarc for the period in which the discontinuance occurs and for of the msarcs for each semi annual period remaining in the contract tariff term 
in addition  the company will also be required to refund a prorated portion  based upon the number of months remaining in the contract tariff term at the time of termination  of  in credits issued the company by at t 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the contract expires in june the msarcs increase over the term of the contract 
historically  the company has been able to negotiate a settlement of such shortfalls with the carrier which has resulted in no penalty being incurred by the company 
although the company currently is negotiating with at t for a new contract  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reach a favorable settlement with the carrier with respect to its current or any future shortfalls 
should the company be unable to reach such a favorable settlement it would be required to fund the resulting penalties through its operating cash flow  funds available under its existing credit facility and working capital 
if required at this time  such funds would not be available to meet the commitments when due and the carrier could terminate the company s underlying service 
during fiscal  the company invested million in computer equipment and related programming 
in addition  to support the staffing increase through december  the company expended million on furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements 
the company has budgeted  to complete the in house billing system and  should funds be available  intends to modify and improve netbase during fiscal the company has gross deferred tax assets of million for which a valuation allowance of million has been established 
the deferred tax assets arise from deductible temporary differences of million and a net operating loss carryforward of  in assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance  the company considered its ability to generate taxable income in recent periods approximately million in the months ended june   the facts and circumstances which led to the significant operating loss incurred in the year ended june   and projections of future taxable income 
in order to realize the net deferred tax asset  the company must generate taxable income of million in future periods prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforward in the year the pre tax loss of million in fiscal included million in special charges which the company believes will not reoccur in future periods 
based upon projections of future operations  the company believes that realization of the net deferred tax asset of million is more likely than not 
the company believes that a combination of improved margins resulting from lower negotiated rates from its carriers or the migration of its traffic to lower cost platforms  reverting to a marketing agent incentive program that emphasizes the amount of monthly billings rather than the volume of orders submitted  as well as reductions in personnel and other operating costs should enable it to return to profitability 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings 
the company generally can be expected to generate taxable income in excess of book income as a result of deductible temporary differences related to the allowance for doubtful accounts and amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
the company is currently negotiating with its lenders to increase availability under its revolving credit facility  amend certain financial covenants and waive certain events of default 
the significant special charges incurred in fiscal resulted in decreased earnings  equity and tangible net worth so that in march the company was in default on certain loan covenants of its credit agreement 
the credit agreement was amended in june  and the covenants were amended so that the defaults as of and proir to april  were waived 
the company was in compliance with the covenants at june  certain of the amended covenants have increasing ratios over time 
the company does not anticipate being in compliance with the covenants subsequent to september   and will need to obtain from its lender waiver or credit agreement amendments in order for the debt not to be in default 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
the company is currently negotiating with its lenders to increase availability under its revolving credit facility and to amend certain financial covenants 
at the present time the lender has not made any demands for payment of the loan  and the company believes that it is not its intention to do so 
while there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in securing such amendments to its existing credit facility  management believes that the lender is receptive to reaching an accommodation under certain conditions and that the company will be able to successfully conclude the negotiations and thus avoid any material adverse effect on the company s operations or financial condition 
in addition  the company is negotiating with its carriers for special terms and consideration 
in the event the company is unsuccessful in achieving any one or a combination of these objectives sufficient to meet the company s liquidity needs  it will seek an alliance with a strategic partner  or in the event no such strategic alliance is accomplished  the company may be required to seek protection under united states bankruptcy laws 
seasonality the company s long distance revenue is subject to seasonal variations 
because most of the company s revenue is generated by non residential customers  the company traditionally experiences decreases in long distance usage and revenue in those periods with holidays 
in past years the company s long distance traffic  which is primarily non residential  has declined slightly during the quarter ending december due to the november and december holiday periods 
inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company s operations to date 
cautionary statements the company s expectations with respect to operating results and other matters described in this annual report on form k  and otherwise embodied in oral and written forward looking statements are subject to the following risks and uncertainties that must be considered when evaluating the likelihood of the company s realization of such expectations attrition rates in the event that the company s attrition rates continue at the current level either as a result of increased provisioning times by its underlying carrier  the purchase of poorly performing traffic  or the inability to properly manage the existing customer base due to unforeseen difficulties with the netbase system  additional charges may be incurred that would affect earnings 
dependence on independent marketing agents the company has a small internal sales force and obtains a significant majority of its new customers from the company s network of independent marketing agents agents 
the company s near term ability to expand its business depends upon whether it can continue to maintain favorable relationships with existing agents and recruit and establish new relationships with additional agents 
should the return to the original netbase system not continue to improve the exchange of information between the company and its agents  no assurances can be made as to the willingness of the existing agents to continue to provide new orders to the company or as to the company s ability to attract and establish relationships with new agents 
inability to collect accounts receivable although the company s bad debt rate has improved somewhat in recent months  if it were not to continue to improve or revert to the fiscal rate  either as a result of the purchase of poorly performing traffic or the inability of the company to properly manage existing customer receivables  additional charges may be incurred that would affect earnings 
in addition  the inability to collect past due receivables could have a material adverse impact upon the company s liquidity and cash flow 
dependence on at t and other facilities based carriers the company does not own transmission facilities and currently depends primarily upon at t and  to a lesser extent  upon sprint to provide it with the telecommunications services that it resells to its customers and the detailed information upon which it bases its customer billings 
the company s near term ability to expand its business depends upon whether it can continue to maintain favorable relationships with at t and sprint 
although the company believes that its relations with at t and sprint are good and should remain so with continued contract compliance  the termination of the company s current contracts with either at t or sprint or the loss of the telecommunications services that the company receives from at t or sprint could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
this dependence on the company s primary carrier further manifested itself during the quarter ended march   as continued delays in provisioning activating new customers by the carrier continued to result in a backlog of customers who would otherwise have been activated on the company s long distance and billing services 
although the carrier has agreed to take certain steps to decrease the provisioning time which has resulted in an elimination of the provisioning backlog  there can be no assurance that similar delays will not occur in the future 
carrier commitments the company has significant commitments with its two primary carriers to resell long distance services 
the company s contracts with its carriers contain penalty clauses which could materially and adversely impact the company should the company incur a shortfall in meeting its commitments 
the company currently is in a shortfall situation with both of its primary carriers 
although the company has from time to time failed to meet its commitment levels under a particular contract and in each case been able to negotiate a settlement with the carrier which resulted in no penalty being incurred by the company  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reach similar favorable settlements with its carriers currently or in the event that the company should continue to fail to meet its commitments 
in recent years  at t  mci and sprint have consistently followed one another in pricing their long distance products 
if mci and sprint were to lower their rates for long distance service and at t did not adopt a similar price reduction  adverse customer reaction could affect the company s ability to meet its commitments under the at t contract which could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial position and results of operations 
developmental and transitional problems with netbase netbase plus r  the company s second generation customer management system  was not able to meet the operating requirements of the company 
as a result  in the third quarter of fiscal the company began reverting to an enhanced version of the original netbase operating system 
although the company successfully completed the reversion in the fourth quarter of fiscal and has made continued improvements to the operating system  to the extent that the company experiences significant growth  the existing netbase operating system may reach technical limitations and hinder reporting visibility to management as well as cause a decline in customer service  thereby negatively impacting attrition levels and  therefore  results of operations 
relationships with state regulatory agencies the company s intrastate long distance telecommunications operations are subject to various state laws and regulations  including prior certification  notification or registration requirements 
the company must generally obtain and maintain certificates of public convenience and necessity from regulatory authorities in most states in which it offers service 
the company presently is responding to consumer protection inquiries from seven states 
management believes these inquiries will be resolved satisfactorily  although settlement offers may be made or accepted in instances in which it is determined to be cost effective 
during the quarter ended march   the company recorded an accrual for such estimated settlements 
no assurances can be made however  that additional states will not begin inquiries or that the current accrual will be sufficient to provide for existing or future settlements 
failure to resolve inquiries satisfactorily or reach a settlement with the regulatory agencies could  in the extreme  result in the inability of the company to provide long distance service in the jurisdiction requiring regulatory certification 
any failure to maintain proper certification in jurisdictions in which the company provides a significant amount of intrastate long distance service could have a material adverse effect on the company s business
