with respect to product liability issues  the litigation and regulatory risks will continue to exist even with respect to those products that have received or in the future may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale 
it is possible that adverse results arising from product liability or intellectual property actions  as well as adverse results arising from regulatory or administrative proceedings  could negatively affect the company s future results of operations

in the united states  the fda regulates the introduction  manufacturing  labeling and recordkeeping procedures for medical devices 
the process of obtaining marketing clearance from the fda for new products and existing products can be time consuming and expensive  and there is no assurance that such clearances will be granted or that fda review will not involve delays that would adversely affect the company s ability to commercialize additional products or additional applications for existing products 
in addition  certain of the company s products that are in the research and development stage may be subject to a lengthy and expensive pre market approval pma process with the fda
