certain trends and uncertainties as a cautionary note to investors  the company and its representatives may make oral or written statements from time to time that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the united states federal securities laws  including information contained in this form k which is not historical 
there are a number of important factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated 
such factors include  but are not limited to  those set forth below 
acquisition strategy 
in pursuit of its strategic objective of becoming the leading global single source provider of water treatment systems and services the company has  since  acquired and successfully integrated more than united states based and international businesses with strong market positions and substantial water treatment expertise 
the company s acquisition strategy entails the potential risks inherent in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent or other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates and in integrating the operations of acquired companies 
although the company generally has been successful in pursuing these acquisitions  there can be no assurance that acquisition opportunities will continue to be available  that the company will have access to the capital required to finance potential acquisitions  that the company will continue to acquire businesses or that any business acquired will be integrated successfully or prove profitable 
see business general 
international transactions 
the company has made and expects it will continue to make acquisitions and to obtain contracts in europe  asia  latin america and other areas outside the united states 
while these activities may provide important opportunities for the company to offer its products and services internationally  they also entail the risks associated with conducting business internationally  including the risk of currency fluctuations  slower payment of invoices and possible social  political and economic instability 
reliance on key personnel 
the company s operations are dependent on the continued efforts of senior management  in particular richard j 
heckmann  its chairman  chief executive officer and president 
should any of the senior managers be unable to continue in their present roles  the company s prospects could be adversely affected 
see business executive officers 
profitability of fixed price contracts 
a significant portion of the company s revenues are generated under fixed price contracts 
to the extent that original cost estimates are inaccurate  costs to complete increase  delivery schedules are delayed or progress under a contract is otherwise impeded  revenue recognition and profitability from a particular contract may be adversely affected 
the company routinely records upward or downward adjustments with respect to fixed price contracts due to changes in estimates of costs to complete such contracts 
there can be no assurance that future downward adjustments will not be material 
cyclicality of capital equipment sales 
the sale of capital equipment within the water treatment industry is cyclical and influenced by various economic factors including interest rates and general fluctuations of the business cycle 
the company s revenues from capital equipment sales were approximately of total revenues for the fiscal year ended march  and for the fiscal year ended march  while the company sells capital equipment to customers in diverse industries and in global markets  cyclicality of capital equipment sales and instability of general economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the company s revenues and profitability 
potential environmental risks 
the company s business and products may be significantly influenced by the constantly changing body of environmental laws and regulations  which require that certain environmental standards be met and impose liability for the failure to comply with such standards 
while the company endeavors at each of its facilities to assure compliance with environmental laws and regulations  there can be no assurance that the company s operations or activities  or historical operations by others at the company s locations  will not result in civil or criminal enforcement actions or private actions that could have a materially adverse effect on the company 
in that regard  allegations have been made by federal and state environmental regulatory authorities of multiple violations by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company with respect to applicable wastewater pretreatment standards at a connecticut ion exchange regeneration facility acquired by the company in october from anjou 
a grand jury investigation is pending which is believed to relate to the same conditions that were the subject of the allegations 
the company has rights of indemnification from anjou which may be available with respect to these matters 
the company s activities as owner and operator of a hazardous waste treatment and recovery facility are subject to stringent laws and regulations and compliance reviews 
failure of this facility to comply with those regulations could result in substantial fines and the suspension or revocation of the facility s hazardous waste permit 
in addition  to some extent  the liabilities and risks imposed by environmental laws on the company s customers may adversely impact demand for certain of the company s products or services or impose greater liabilities and risks on the company  which could also have an adverse effect on the company s competitive or financial position 
see business environmental regulation 
competition 
the water purification and wastewater treatment industry is fragmented and highly competitive 
the company competes with many united states based and international companies in its global markets 
the principal methods of competition in the markets in which the company competes are technology  service  price  product specifications  customized design  product knowledge and reputation  ability to obtain sufficient performance bonds  timely delivery  the relative ease of system operation and maintenance  and the prompt availability of replacement parts 
in the municipal contract bid process  pricing and ability to meet bid specifications are the primary considerations 
while no competitor is considered dominant  there are competitors that are divisions or subsidiaries of larger companies which have significantly greater resources than the company  which  among other things  could be a competitive disadvantage to the company in securing certain projects 
see business competition 
technological and regulatory change 
the water purification and wastewater treatment business is characterized by changing technology  competitively imposed process standards and regulatory requirements  each of which influences the demand for the company s products and services 
changes in regulatory or industrial requirements may render certain of the company s purification and treatment products and processes obsolete 
acceptance of new products may also be affected by the adoption of new government regulations requiring stricter standards 
the company s ability to anticipate changes in technology and regulatory standards and to successfully develop and introduce new and enhanced products on a timely basis will be a significant factor in the company s ability to grow and to remain competitive 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to achieve the technological advances that may be necessary for it to remain competitive or that certain of its products will not become obsolete 
in addition  the company is subject to the risks generally associated with new product introductions and applications  including lack of market acceptance  delays in development or failure of products to operate properly 
impact of recently issued accounting standards 
in march  the financial accounting standards board issued a new statement titled accounting for impairment of long lived assets 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued a new statement titled accounting for stock based compensation 
the new statements are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe that adoption of these new standards will have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements
