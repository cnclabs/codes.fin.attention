item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
results of operations the partnership recorded earnings of approximately million or per buc for the year ended december   compared to earnings of approximately million or per buc for the year ended december   and approximately 
million or 
per buc in the earnings in reflected a third quarter charge of million which related to interest rate exchange agreements 
see  provision for loss on interest rate exchange agreements below for further discussion 
the partnership s income for  and consisted primarily of the earnings of eureka 
eureka s principal income component is net interest income which is the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on interest bearing liabilities 
earning assets primarily consist of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities mbs  and are financed by customer deposits and other borrowings 
eureka s earning assets are obtained through retail and wholesale loan originations  and are supplemented with purchased loans and mbs 
at december   the partnership had total assets of approximately billion  which consisted primarily of the assets of eureka and its subsidiaries 
the business strategy for was focused on managing interest rate risk  credit risk and controlling non interest expense 
the increase in earnings in was primarily the result of the following o although interest rates declined somewhat during  the rate environment during was more stable than in and a slow down in loan prepayments allowed the yields on adjustable rate loans to adjust upwards to their more fully indexed rates 
interest expense for the interest rate exchange agreements which was an adjustment to the yield on loans  decreased during as compared to due to the maturity of approximately million in swap agreements 
the above factors resulted in an increase in the net interest margin from in to in o the provision for loan losses decreased from million in to  in the decrease in the provision was due to the continued improvement in asset quality which is discussed in the credit risk section 
o non interest expense before interest rate swap provisions recoveries decreased from to due to management s focus on controlling costs for professional services  advertising expenses and other general and administrative expenses 
in addition  the reduction in loan originations in reduced the loan agent commissions  and staffing levels for for eureka were at a record low of full time employees as of december the above factors contributed to the increase in earnings  but future changes in the interest rate environment could impact the above factors and the current year s earnings may not be indicative of any future period s earnings 
eureka s business approach is characterized by continued strong capital ratios and low exposure to credit losses 
eureka s tangible and risk based capital ratios were and  respectively  at december   as compared to and  respectively  at december  non performing assets declined to approximately 
of total assets at december   as compared to 
at december   despite the difficult california economy 
eureka s ratio of non performing assets is well below the december  average of reported by the office of thrift supervision ots for thrifts located in california 
the partnership s earning assets totaled billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
eureka s earning assets to total assets ratio was at december  and during  eureka originated million of mortgage loans net of loan sales of million in primarily unit residential properties  and purchased million of mortgage loans and million of mbs for a total of million in additions to mortgage loans and mbs 
of the million originated during  million were wholesale originations and million were retail originations 
the wholesale loan origination system was established during  and management believes that the wholesale loan originations will increase as a percentage of total loan originations through wholesale loan originations enable eureka to add assets that meet its credit quality guidelines within its market area 
these additions to earning assets were partially offset by mortgage loan and mbs paydowns of million 
mortgage loan prepayments were for  as compared to for adjustable rate loans and mbs held by eureka totaled billion at december   and approximately billion consisted of loans indexed to libor or treasury rates 
fixed rate loans and mbs totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
convertible loans totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
during  customer preferences shifted from adjustable rate loans to convertible loan products which have fixed rates for three to seven years  then change to adjustable rate loans which are for the most part indexed to treasury rates 
convertible loan additions to the loan portfolio totaled million for  as compared to million for as part of its asset liability management strategy  eureka typically sells originated fixed rate loans and retains originated variable and convertible rate loans for its portfolio 
customer deposits are eureka s primary source of funds for lending and investing 
customer deposits totaled billion at december  and other borrowings at december  consisted of short term reverse repurchase agreements and fhlb advances totaling approximately million  compared to million at december  other borrowings supplemented retail deposits as a funding source for the origination or purchase of earning assets 
net interest income net interest income from eureka is the partnership s principal income component and is the difference between interest rates received on earning assets and interest rates paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income before the provision for loan losses was approximately million in  compared to approximately million in  and million in the net interest margin was  and for  and  respectively 
interest rates declined during  but the changes were not as significant as the interest rate changes which occurred during and  and customers responses to the decline in interest rates during were less dramatic 
loan prepayments were for  as compared to and for and  respectively 
the slow down in prepayments allowed the interest rates on adjustable rate loans to increase towards their fully indexed rates  which increased the yield on the loan portfolio 
in addition  interest income in previous periods was more significantly reduced by the interest expense on the interest rate exchange agreements  net of accretion of the liability established in net interest expense for interest rate exchange agreements was million for  as compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease was due to the expiration of million notional amount of interest rate exchange agreements from december  to december  see  provision for loss on interest rate exchange agreements below for further discussion 
during  repayments of mortgage loans and mbs totaled million  and originations and purchases totaled million 
repayments totaled million and originations and purchases totaled million for originations and purchases of adjustable rate loans and mbs during totaled million  of which million were indexed to libor or treasury rates  and million were indexed to the six month certificate of deposit 
of the million in adjustable rate loans and mbs purchased or originated in  million were indexed to libor or treasury rates 
convertible loan additions to the loan portfolio totaled million for  as compared to million for during  customer preferences shifted from adjustable rate loans to convertible loan products which have fixed rates for three to seven years  then change to adjustable rate loans which are for the most part indexed to treasury rates 
eureka generally maintained its customer deposit base by providing attractive deposit products and promotions 
customer deposits as a percentage of total interest bearing liabilities were at december   compared to at december  reverse repurchase agreements and fhlb advances made up the remaining of interest bearing liabilities for for 
fhlb advances totaled million and million  and reverse repurchase agreements totaled million and million  at december  and  respectively 
the shift in other borrowings from repurchase agreements to fhlb advances in was due to a fhlb program offered in the third quarter of that provided more effective leverage and attractive pricing than reverse repurchase agreements 
future changes in the funding sources may have an impact on the net interest margin 
provision for loan losses eureka recorded loan loss provisions of 
million  million and million during  and  respectively 
net loan charge offs were million in  million in and million in of the total net charge offs recorded during   was for eureka s consumer loan portfolio  as compared to million for of the  in consumer loan portfolio net charge offs for   was related to the bankcard receivables 
eureka sold its bankcard receivables in the third quarter of future provisions and charge offs for the consumer loan portfolio are expected to decline due to the sale of the bankcard receivable portfolio 
charge off ratios for the mortgage loan portfolio for and were 
and  respectively 
the decrease in the provision for loan losses from to was due to improvements in asset quality  specifically the decline in the level of non performing and delinquent loans 
non performing loans at december  totaled million as compared to million at december  consequently  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of non performing loans improved from at december  to at december  in addition  the ratio of delinquent loans to total loans was 
at december   as compared to at december  the requirements for the loan loss provision for will depend on the loan portfolio performance and economic conditions affecting customers abilities to repay loans  in particular mortgage loans 
see  credit risk below for additional information 
non interest income non interest income totaled approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million in  and million in the principal components of non interest income are deposit and loan related fees  net gains on the disposition of loans and investments and other non interest income 
deposit and loan related fees were approximately million in  as compared to million for  and million for the decrease in fees in was largely due to the lower volume of loan originations in  as compared to and retail and wholesale mortgage loan originations for were million  as compared to million for during  eureka originated and sold fixed rate loans which conformed to federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc standards with principal balances totaling million  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the loan sales resulted in net gains of  in  compared to  and million in and  respectively 
during  customer preferences shifted from adjustable rate loans to convertible loan products which have fixed rates for three to seven years  then change to adjustable rate loans 
eureka currently retains these loans for its portfolio 
saleable fixed rate loan originations totaled million in  as compared to million for  and million for the low volume of fixed rate loans originated in reduced the opportunities to sell loans in the secondary market 
investment securities sold during resulted in a net gain of million 
there were no investment securities sold in and other non interest income totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
other income included rental income  revenue from the sale of non deposit investment products  income from real estate held for investment  gain on sale of real estate owned reo  servicing fee income from loans serviced for others and other non operating income items 
the net gain on the sales of reo totaled  million and  in  and  respectively 
the volume of foreclosures on mortgage loans and gains or losses from the disposition of these properties cannot be predicted  and transactions for and prior years may not be indicative of results 
income from the sale of non deposit investment products approximated million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decline in non deposit investment sales from million in to million in was due to a customer trend to more liquid investments such as deposits 
income from real estate investments totaled  million and million in  and  respectively 
during the third quarter in  real estate held for sale or investment with a recorded value of million was sold for a net gain of  which was offset by valuation adjustments or write downs of  recorded during the property which was sold in accounted for  and  in other non interest income in and  respectively 
income from real estate held for sale or investment is expected to continue to decline in since the remaining real estate property is undeveloped lots and does not produce income 
servicing fee income from loans serviced for others totaled   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
non interest expense excluding the provision recovery for loss on interest rate exchange agreements which is discussed below  total non interest expense was million for the year ended december   compared to million in  and million in non interest expense includes compensation and benefits expense  occupancy and equipment expense  fdic insurance premiums  professional and advertising expense  and other administrative expenses 
compensation and benefits expense was million in  compared to million in  and million in in addition to management s general effort to reduce controllable costs  the decline in retail loan funding volume in reduced loan agent commissions for as compared to and for  the expense for management incentive compensation was approximately  as compared to million for occupancy expense was million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease from to was due to the sales of real estate investments 
these sales reduced occupancy expense by approximately  for  as compared to professional and advertising expenses were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
other non interest expense totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in these expenses from to was primarily attributable to management s general effort to manage these controllable costs 
provision for loss on interest rate exchange agreements the earnings in reflected a third quarter charge of million which related to interest rate exchange agreements arranged predominantly in  and that were intended to hedge yields on fixed rate mortgages funded by variable rate liabilities 
for reference  the federal funds rate averaged during the four years from the beginning of through  while it averaged for the sustained decline in interest rates and the resultant prepayment of mortgage loans associated with interest rate exchange agreements caused eureka to establish a liability based on the estimated fair value of exchange agreements that were no longer deemed effective as hedges 
during  eureka recorded provisions to non interest expense totaling million 
the provisions reflect the effect of interest rate decreases on the market value of eureka s obligations under interest rate exchange agreements deemed ineffective as hedges 
during  eureka recorded credits to non interest expense totaling million which reflected the effect of interest rate increases on the market value of these interest rate exchange agreements 
net interest expense on interest rate exchange agreements of approximately million was included as an adjustment to interest income on loans during  as compared to million and million in and  respectively 
no additional interest rate exchange agreements were undertaken in  and during  million notional amount of interest rate exchange agreements expired reducing the total notional amount from million at january   to million at the end of by the end of  an additional million of these agreements will expire  a reduction of nearly in a two year period 
future changes in interest rates in either direction could impact the fair market value of the interest rate exchange agreements 
such changes in interest rates may result in future recoveries or provisions  depending upon the direction of movement in interest rates 
income taxes at the partnership level  items of income  expense and gain or loss are reported in the tax returns of the buc holders according to their proportionate interest in the partnership 
at the america first eureka holdings  inc afeh and eureka levels  no regular income tax liability was incurred during  or due to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and other tax benefits in connection with the acquisition of eureka by afeh 
afeh paid alternative minimum taxes of   and  during  and  respectively 
alternative minimum taxes paid  which generate alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards  are recorded as deferred tax assets with an indefinite life and will be used to offset future regular tax liabilities 
recent federal deficit reduction legislation contains a provision that eliminates the deductibility of asset disposition losses to the extent such losses are reimbursed by fslic financial assistance paid to acquirers of failed thrift institutions after march  management has concluded that the earnings impact of this provision in the deficit reduction tax bill on afeh will be negligible 
credit risk eureka s loan portfolio  which consists primarily of loans collateralized by unit residential properties located in california  is characterized by a high level of credit quality in spite of california s difficult real estate market 
that strong credit quality is evidenced by a 
ratio of non performing assets to total assets at december   and is the result of two factors the prudent lending practices followed since afeh s acquisition of eureka  and the seasoning of the pre acquisition loan portfolio 
eureka s lending activities subsequent to the acquisition have been focused on loans secured by unit residential properties primarily located in northern california 
multi family  commercial and land mortgage loans constitute and of eureka s mortgage portfolio at december  and  respectively 
eureka does not have any construction loans or construction loan commitments outstanding 
the following schedule outlines the delinquencies  non performing loans  and loan loss reserves by category for the loan portfolio delinquent mortgage consumer total mortgage consumer total days       days       days       total       non performing loans       loan loss reserves       loan loss reserves as a of non performing loans the ratio of loans which are thirty or more days delinquent to total loans outstanding was 
as of december   compared to as of december  eureka s delinquency ratio is well below the average as of december   reported by the ots for california savings institutions 
the bank s ratio of non performing assets loans which were ninety or more days delinquent and real estate acquired through foreclosure to total assets was 
at december   compared to 
at the end of eureka s non performing asset ratio was also well below the average as of december   reported by the ots for california savings institutions 
eureka s ratio of loan loss reserves to non performing loans was at december  loan loss reserves were 
and 
of total loans outstanding at december  and  respectively 
the decline from to in the loan loss reserves to total loans ratio is due to the improvement in non performing assets and delinquent loans 
eureka s determination of loan loss reserves and the resulting provision for loan losses are based upon judgments and assumptions regarding various factors including general economic conditions  internal asset review findings  composition of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience and estimates of potential future losses 
management believes that it has provided adequate loan loss reserves to cover potential losses  particularly considering the low level of delinquencies and charge offs experienced by eureka over the past five years and continued adherence to strict credit quality control guidelines 
the future loss experience related to changes in the economy and interest rate environment  however  cannot be predicted 
interest rate risk as of december   eureka had a positive one year interest rate repricing gap of approximately six percent  and a negative three year interest rate repricing gap of approximately one percent 
at december   eureka had a negative one year interest rate repricing gap of approximately three percent  and a negative three year repricing gap of approximately four percent 
the interest rate repricing gap reported at december  assumes higher prepayment levels on mortgage loans due to the lower interest rate environment  as compared to december  additionally  the interest rate repricing gap reported at december  has been impacted by a larger percentage of deposits and borrowings maturing over one year  as compared to december  in evaluating eureka s exposure to interest rate risk  certain limitations to the gap measure should be considered 
for example  certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing periods  but react in differing degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  some assets such as adjustable rate mortgages  have product features which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
further  the gap measures include assumptions about mortgage prepayments 
major shifts in interest rates can cause assumptions regarding anticipated mortgage prepayment levels to vary significantly from actual results 
eureka considers the anticipated effects of these various factors in managing its interest rate risk position 
at december   approximately of eureka s interest earning assets were rate sensitive and reprice within a year 
future potential impacts on the industry and eureka s earnings include deposit costs may not decline as quickly as wholesale borrowing costs if market interest rates continue to decline  a shift in origination volume from adjustable rate mortgages that reprice every six months to convertible rate mortgages with initial fixed rates for periods of three  five and seven years  which may adversely impact asset and liability matching if loan repayments vary materially from anticipated levels  and net interest margin compression  due to various factors including short term funding costs rising faster than arm index rates  and interest rate caps and adjustment intervals on arm loans delaying full adjustment to market rates 
liquidity eureka derives its liquidity primarily from loan repayments  customer deposits  fhlb advances and securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
eureka manages its liquidity through the coordination of the relative maturities of assets and liabilities 
the sources of liquidity are influenced by various uncertainties  primarily market interest rates 
eureka continually evaluates its sources of funds  and a decline in any one source of funds generally can be offset by an alternate source  although potentially at a different cost 
the ots regulations require a savings institution to maintain a liquidity ratio of at least of cash and specified securities to net withdrawable accounts and borrowings due in one year 
at december   eureka had a liquidity ratio of 
capital resources at december   partnership equity totaled approximately million  compared to million at december  the partnership made distributions to buc holders at an annualized rate of per buc in  and the return on average partnership total equity was for the year ended december  compared to in the primary sources of the partnership s distributions are dividends received from afeh and interest earned on temporary investments 
management expects that the present level of distributions will continue throughout future distributions will depend primarily on the levels of dividends paid to the partnership from afeh  which depends on the profitability of eureka 
dividend payments by eureka are subject to the following limitations under the fdic capital maintenance agreement no dividends may be paid if regulatory capital is less than required levels 
aggregate dividends paid subsequent to the acquisition may not exceed of the capital contributed upon and after the acquisition  plus of aggregate net income earned subsequent to the acquisition 
dividends in any calendar year may not exceed the greater of million or of net income for the year 
ots regulations require that savings institutions meet three separate capital tests a risk based capital standard  a core capital standard and a tangible capital standard 
at december   eureka maintained regulatory capital as follows s in s tangible core risk based capital capital capital risk based amount of assets amount of assets amount assets gaap capital    non allowable assets other intangible assets    non includable subsidiaries    unrealized gains on securities available for sale additional capital item general valuation allowances  computed regulatory capital    minimum capital requirement    excess regulatory capital    recent accounting pronouncements during  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  sfas no 
 accounting for mortgage servicing rights  and sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
these pronouncements must be adopted for fiscal years beginning after december   and the adoption of these pronouncements is not expected to be material to the partnership s financial statements 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these pronouncements 
deposit insurance and other matters eureka s deposits are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic up to the maximum amount provided by law through the savings association insurance fund saif 
for the year ended december   eureka paid deposit insurance premiums to the saif of million based on an annual assessment rate of 
of covered deposits 
in contrast  the fdic has lowered the deposit assessment rate for well capitalized bank insurance fund bif insured institutions to of covered deposits  effective january  these reductions could provide most commercial banks competitive advantages over institutions with deposits that are primarily saif insured such as eureka 
omnibus budget legislation has been passed by both houses of congress  but vetoed by the president  which includes provision that would recapitalize the saif through a combined approach of imposing a one time special assessment on saif insured institutions  and an incremental pro rata charge on saif insured institutions and commercial banks insured under the bif  which would be used to pay the interest on financing corporation fico bonds issued as part of the savings association rescue package adopted under firrea 
the saif recapitalization provisions would impose a one time special assessment of approximately basis points on deposits held by saif insured institutions as of march   payable not later than days after the enactment of the legislation 
the bill also would provide for a merger of bif and saif by no later than january   provided that no insured savings associations are in existence on that date 
the legislation also would repeal the thrift bad debt reserve method of calculation under the internal revenue code  effective for tax years beginning after december  hence  most large saif insured institutions including eureka would be required to change to the specific charge off method of accounting for bad debts and would be required to recapture statutory excess reserves as provided in the bill 
at the present time  the house and senate are discussing means to resolve outstanding differences over the broader budget bill and obtain presidential approval of the revised legislation 
eureka cannot predict whether  when or in what form any such legislation will ultimately be enacted  or what the effective date of any legislation will be 
if saif legislation as described above is adopted  eureka would be subject to the special assessments levied on saif insured institutions and would be required to pay approximately million which would be a charge to income 
the impact on eureka of the change in the accounting and tax treatment of statutory bad debts under the new legislation would be negligible 
in addition  congress is considering broader legislative measures which would effectively combine the federal thrift and national bank charters by eliminating the federal thrift charter  and abolishing the ots 
while eureka again cannot predict whether  when or in what form any such legislation will be enacted  eureka would be required to give up its federal savings bank charter and convert either to a national bank  or a state bank or savings association  if this legislation is adopted 
further  afeh and the partnership would be subject to regulation as bank holding companies under federal law 
the financial impact on eureka  afeh or the partnership of any such measures enacted cannot be determined at this time  although such impact could be material
