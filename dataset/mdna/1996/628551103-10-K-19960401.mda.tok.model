in some cases  insurance companies were forced to discontinue writing business in certain high risk areas and in general reduced new business activity 
consequently  the demand for information services declined  intensifying competition among information providers and placing downward pressure on price 
during the first quarter of there was a major earthquake in california and  by the second quarter  several insurance companies that used the company s information services had stopped writing business in that state

these increased costs were offset in part by a decrease in the use of temporary employees and a decrease in compensation and other benefits related to the company s sale of its health insurance systems division on june  see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
employee compensation and benefits increased million for compared with  and is principally related to an increase of million in costs associated with the acquisition of cybertek corporation in august  the acquisition of a data center  including its workforce  in bergen  norway  in december  and the increased use of temporary labor throughout the year

million for automobile and million for risk on revenues of million million for automobile and million for risk 
although the company took actions during to improve the overall performance of these businesses  such as implementing management changes  realignment and consolidation of field offices  and refining and enhancing current product offerings  these businesses continued to reflect declining sales and earnings  with the loss of key customers 
the company determined that there was a trend towards reduced sales and acceptance of new business in the industry as a result of multiple years of major catastrophic losses affecting this industry 
the company believes that this industry reacted to these catastrophic losses by focusing on risk concentration and in many cases making deliberate decisions to discontinue writing business in certain high risk areas  and some insurers ceased doing business or withdrew from certain states 
although the company consolidated its branch network offices to lower its fixed costs  this did not offset the increasing variable costs incurred due to the geographic dispersion of the company s customer base 
as competition increased  leading to intense price competition among information providers  the company s competitors  through package pricing  were offering certain competing products to the market below the company s cost 
the company believed that the combination of factors would result in a continued decline in demand for certain information services

during  the company continued to examine its options to improve the overall performance of the risk information services business 
options considered by the company regarding this business included price increases  outsourcing arrangements with other providers  automation of its field force and a continued consolidation of field offices 
the price increases and the consolidation of the field offices  implemented during the first and second quarters of  did reduce the company s operating losses by the third quarter of  but not significantly 
additionally  the company was not successful in its efforts to outsource the business  because major vendors in the market provided database information to insurance companies and were not interested in performing data collection services 
the company determined that automating the field force was not economically justified 
the risk information services business continued to reflect declining sales and earnings  reporting revenues of million for the year ended december  and an operating loss of million 
the company  as a result of its continued detailed business assessment  determined that there were no further services or investment alternatives that could bring these operations to profitability and that the cash losses related to the risk information services business would continue into the future 
as a result  the company decided to restructure its property and casualty information services business and cease providing certain data collection services  including property inspections  commercial audits and pre employment checks 
the company decided to sell the pre employment business and completely cease operations in property inspections and commercial audits 
as a result  the company recorded  at december   restructuring charges of million for disposal and severance charges related to exiting these operations 
as a result of less than expected financial results for relating to the company s on site medical correspondence information services business  acquired in february  the company attempted to improve the results of the business by closing unprofitable offices and modifying the volume and type of services offered 
these modifications resulted in an increase in staffing requirements and equipment expense  however  the anticipated increase in revenues did not occur  and the financial results of the business fell short of expectations 
the company performed a detailed assessment of the business and expects a continuing decline in revenues and cash flows 
as a result  the company determined that the expected future cash flows of this business did not support the carrying value of the related goodwill and identifiable intangible assets

million

during  several of the company s customers of this business opted to either move some or all states served by them to lad servicing carriers or to not renew their agreements for these services for other reasons 
in addition  the texas plan implemented rate increases and a mandatory takeout plan which had the effect of further decreasing the number of policies served by the company 
during  the company decided to replace the software acquired in based on a detailed business assessment performed by the company  the anticipated discounted cash flows for this business for the period until the software replacement is completed do not support the carrying value of the software and related goodwill associated with this business

million and related goodwill million 
during  the company ceased the active marketing of certain processing software utilized in the processing of individual accident and health business by the company s life business 
revenue growth for this product  if any  is expected to come from existing clients adding policy volume through traditional new business sales or by the acquisition of new  multi policy blocks of business  however  the existing customer base is expected to ultimately decrease as processing contracts expire

the company believes that its forecasted future results based on current market conditions and recent historical trends  is the best estimate of the company s discounted future cash flows 
expected future cash flows for these businesses are based on the current level of operating income or loss continuing in the near term with only a modest recovery over the long term principally because the company expects the negative impact of the insurance industry market environment to continue into the future 
consequently  at the end of the forecast period  a residual was included based on an estimate of liquidation value

factors that may affect future results the company s operating results and financial condition can be impacted by a number of factors  including the following  any of which could cause actual results to vary materially from current and historical results or the company s anticipated future results 
currently  the company s business is focused principally within the global property and casualty and life insurance industries 
significant changes in the regulatory or market environment of these industries could impact demand for the company s software products and services 
additionally  there is increasing competition for the company s products and services  and there can be no assurance that the company s current products and services will remain competitive  or that the company s development efforts will produce products with the cost and performance characteristics necessary to remain competitive 
furthermore  the market for the company s products and services is characterized by rapid changes in technology 
the company s success will depend on the level of market acceptance of the company s products  technologies and enhancements  and its ability to introduce such products  technologies and enhancements to the market on a timely and cost effective basis  and maintain a labor force sufficiently skilled to compete in the current environment 
contracts with governmental agencies involve a variety of special risks  including the risk of early contract termination by the governmental agency and changes associated with newly elected state administrations or newly appointed regulators 
the timing and amount of the company s revenues are subject to a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the timing of customers decisions to enter into large license agreements with the company  which make estimation of operating results prior to the end of a quarter or year extremely uncertain 
additionally  while management believes that the company s financing needs for the foreseeable future will be satisfied from cash flows from operations and the company s currently existing credit facilities  unforeseen events or adverse economic or business trends may significantly increase cash demands beyond those currently anticipated or affect the company s ability to generate raise cash to satisfy financing needs 
a significant portion of both the company s revenue and its operating income is derived from initial licensing charges received as part of the company s software licensing activities 
because a substantial portion of these revenues is recorded at the time new systems are licensed  there can be significant fluctuations from period to period in the revenues and operating income derived from licensing activities 
this is attributable principally to the timing of customers decisions to enter into license agreements with the company  which the company is unable to control 
because of the foregoing factors  as well as other factors affecting the company s operating results  past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance  and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
seasonality and inflation the company s operations have not proven to be significantly seasonal  although quarterly revenues and net income could be expected to vary at times 
this is attributable principally to the timing of customers entering into license agreements with the company and fluctuations in the amount of certain information services used by customers  principally during holiday seasons and periods of severe weather 
the company is unable to control the timing of these decisions or fluctuations 
although the company cannot accurately determine the amounts attributable thereto  the company has been affected by inflation through increased costs of employee compensation and other operating expenses 
to the extent permitted by the marketplace for the company s products and services  the company attempts to recover increases in costs by periodically increasing prices 
additionally  most of the company s license agreements and long term services agreements provide for annual increases in charges

these and other factors may cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated
