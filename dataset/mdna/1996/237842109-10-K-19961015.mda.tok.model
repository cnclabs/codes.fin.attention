percentage of total percentage revenue for fiscal years increase decrease ended june  from prior year operating statement data total revenue cost of revenue gross profit loss operating expenses engineering and product development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net income loss before income tax and cumulative effect of change in accounting for income taxes income tax expense benefit cumulative effect of change in accounting for income taxes net income loss not meaningful early in fiscal the company was notified of reductions in quantities of custom modems under a contract with ibm which resulted in a substantial decline in the company s revenue and backlog from prior periods 
in spite of the revenue decline  data race has continued its investments in the development and marketing of its custom modem products 
recently  the company won contracts with and began shipments to nec technologies  inc and texas instruments  inc 
the company is currently at various stages of discussion with several other oems 
during fiscal the company significantly increased its investment in development  sales  and marketing of its multi media network multiplexer products 
as a result of these investments  the company has enhanced its future proof tm architecture with significant new features and improved product reliability 
during the year  the company also increased its marketing communications efforts to better inform its prospective customers of its products advantages 
these efforts have yet to result in the anticipated increase in revenue 
as a result  during the fourth quarter  the company took steps to align its expenses more closely to revenue 
early in fiscal  the company initiated a major development effort for a new product line intended to address the needs of the telecommuter 
throughout fiscal  the company increased its investment in development  sales  and marketing expenses associated with this new product line 
during the year  the company completed the initial product definition based on feedback from several fortune class companies and delivered a concept demonstration system to a large potential customer 
the company believes that it could begin to realize revenue shipments from this new product line as early as the middle of fiscal year the company s results of operations have varied  are likely to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and will depend on numerous factors  including 
the company s success at winning contracts to provide modems to notebook computer manufacturers  
market success of such notebook computers  
the ability of the company to remain ahead of its competition in the ability to rapidly bring advanced features and functions to market  
changing market needs and advancements in technology  
emergence of industry standards  
competitive pricing  
the reliability of the company s products  
the company s ability to communicate to its prospective customers the advantages of its future proof tm architecture and the importance thereof  
the size of the target market for the company s products  
competitive offerings providing similar capabilities  
the ability to bring new products  including the product line being developed for telecommuters  to market before larger competitors offer similar capability  
the company s success at attracting and retaining lead customers to assist with product definition  and their willingness to purchase substantial volumes  and 
component part availability 
there can be no assurance that these factors will materialize in a manner which is favorable to the company 
unless and until the company s revenue is increased through volume deliveries under existing or future oem modem agreements  substantial increases in network multiplexer sales  sales of the new product line being developed  or a combination of these  the company anticipates recognizing losses

revenue from shipments to and cancellation fees from ibm  the company s largest customer in fiscal year  represented of total revenue 
the company believes that its custom modem business will for the foreseeable future continue to be characterized by a small number of large contracts  each typically with volume deliveries over a short period 
the active market life of a notebook computer has continued to shorten 
a year ago  a typical notebook computer s active market life was nine to twelve months  recent experience indicates it is now six months or less

as long as the custom modem business continues to dominate the company s revenue  the company anticipates continued fluctuation between periods of profit and loss 
network product revenue decreased by during fiscal to million from million in fiscal primarily due to product reliability problems and increased competitive pressures

engineering and product development expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the fiscal engineering and product development expenses increased over the prior year in all three product lines  primarily due to personnel related costs 
however  during the fourth quarter these expenses were reduced for multiplexer and custom modem products and a greater percentage of engineering resources were allocated to the new telecommuter product line 
engineering and product development expenses were of revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in spending as a percent of revenue was primarily caused by the increases in engineering and product development expenditures described above and the decrease in total revenue during fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to increased trade show and advertising expenses  personnel related costs  and travel expenses

network product revenue decreased by during fiscal to million from million in fiscal the company believes that this reduction in network product revenue was caused primarily by increased competitive pressure and by products not achieving user reliability expectations regarding certain features such as voice quality 
these issues are now resolved and  as indicated above  the company believes its products now generally meet customers reliability expectations 
the cost of revenue in fiscal was million resulting in a gross profit of million compared to a loss at the gross profit line of million in fiscal gross profit margin for fiscal was 
excluding write offs of million in fiscal  gross profit would have been million in  and the gross profit margin would have been in fiscal engineering and product development expenses remained relatively flat from fiscal although expenses did not increase  the company continued to make significant improvements in fiscal to the network product family and did not capitalize any material software expenditures for data fax custom modem products 
engineering and product development expenses were of revenue in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in spending as a percent of revenue was primarily caused by the increase in total revenue from fiscal sales and marketing expenses decreased during fiscal to million from million in fiscal fiscal expenses were unusually high because of a million write down of intangible assets acquired in from omnitel  inc excluding the write down in fiscal  sales and marketing expenses decreased in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to the company s withdrawal from the pc distributor and dealer channel 
sales and marketing expenses in fiscal were of revenue  down from of fiscal revenue

as of june   the company had no short term credit facility 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reduced its work force by and took other steps to reduce expenses and the resulting drain on cash 
however  operating losses as well as the start up cash requirements of new custom modem contracts have had a continuing negative impact on the company s cash balance 
as long as shipments of custom modem products to oems dominate the company s revenue  the company expects to continue to have fluctuations in reported revenue and resulting swings between profit and loss 
the company believes it has adequate funds available to meet its current operating obligations 
however  the ability to make future capital expenditures and fund the development of new products including the new telecommuter line  are dependent on existing cash and some or all of the following the ability to successfully negotiate a credit facility with a financial institution  the ability to secure an equity investment  favorable settlement of the shareholder lawsuit  and the return to profitable operations of the company 
there can be no assurance that these factors affecting cash will be resolved in a manner favorable to the company
