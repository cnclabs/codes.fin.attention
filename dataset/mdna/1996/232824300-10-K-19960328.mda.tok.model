beginning with  the company changed from a fiscal year end to a calendar year end 
previously  the company operated on a week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest to december references below to relate to the fiscal year ended january  results of operations background 
historically  cytogen s revenues have resulted primarily from i payments received from the sale of research services pursuant to collaborative agreements  ii fees generated from the licensing of its technology and marketing rights to its products and iii product related revenues on sales of its oncoscint products in the us and western europe 
in december  cytogen entered into a research and development and option agreement the elan agreement with elan corporation  plc elan under which both parties will implement a research program that combines cytogen s genetic diversity library gdl technology with elan s drug delivery system technology to collaboratively develop orally administered products 
thereunder  elan has been granted an option for the exclusive worldwide licensing rights to any products so developed and the company will receive royalties based on sales  if any  of such products 
elan will provide the funding necessary for the company to fulfill its obligations under the research program with aggregate payments for work performed by cytogen not to exceed million during the first sixteen months of the research program 
during  because of a contractual dispute between cytogen and cytorad incorporated cytorad  no contract revenues were recorded by cytogen for research services performed on behalf of cytorad  although cytogen continued with the development of the products licensed to cytorad 
in  cytogen acquired cytorad by merging cytorad with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of cytogen 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the merger  the company acquired million of cytorad s cash and securities  before payment of certain transaction costs 
in addition  in  the company recorded a one time non cash charge to the statement of operations of million for the acquisition of technology and marketing rights pertaining to the merger 
in december  cytogen entered into a license agreement the dp merck agreement with the dupont merck pharmaceutical company dupont merck pursuant to which dupont merck will have responsibility for manufacturing and marketing quadramet in the us  if and when approved for marketing by the us food and drug administration fda 
the company has retained the right to co promote the product to nuclear medicine specialists 
pursuant to the dp merck agreement  cytogen received from dupont merck an up front cash payment of million in december and million in january  of which million is to fund additional clinical programs to expand the use and marketing of quadramet and million was to purchase  shares of cytogen common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the new drug application nda for quadramet was accepted for filing by fda effective august the timing and outcome of fda s decision regarding quadramet cannot be predicted by the company at this time 
beginning in july  as a result of the termination of cytogen s relationship with knoll pharmaceuticals company knoll  product related revenues have included product sales by cytogen to its us customers 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
since that date  cytogen has not recorded any product sales to knoll or any co promotion revenues 
in addition  in december  cytogen entered into a disengagement agreement the disengagement agreement with chiron bv  formerly eurocetus bv  successor in interest to eurocetus international  nv chiron to reacquire the exclusive marketing and distribution rights to oncoscint cr ov in europe the european rights previously granted to chiron 
this reacquisition was consummated in february and since that date  oncoscint cr ov has not been marketed outside the us see note to the consolidated financial statements 
to date  sales of oncoscint cr ov in both the us and european markets have been limited  in part  because oncoscint cr ov is a technique dependent product that requires a high degree of proficiency in nuclear imaging  as well as a thorough appreciation of the information the scan can provide 
cytogen believes that sales of oncoscint cr ov may be increased because of approval by fda of repeat administration  which occurred in november  implementation of better quality control at the time the image is actually acquired  and through greater assistance with the interpretation of the scans 
the approval of repeat administration extends the prior fda approval of single administration indication to include readministration of oncoscint cr ov to human anti mouse antibody negative patients who are at risk of recurrence of their cancer 
while an important next step for oncoscint  cytogen believes that sales of oncoscint cr ov may be only modestly increased because of repeat administration 
cytogen is in the process of establishing a network of qualified nuclear medicine physicians through its partners in excellence or pie tm program the pie program 
the pie program includes rigorous training  testing  and ongoing quality assurance protocols with active support and certification in conjunction with the american college of nuclear physicians 
the pie program is being further developed in preparation for the launch of prostascint  for which a product license application pla was accepted as filed by fda in march  although the timing and outcome of fda s decision regarding prostascint cannot be predicted by the company 
in addition  cytogen is exploring the use of teleradiology to support the pie program in order to allow for improvement of the acquisition and interpretation of both oncoscint cr ov and prostascint scans 
in its strictest form  teleradiology provides two way communications by linking an imaging center with an off site imaging specialist 
the use of teleradiology has advanced due to improvements in related computer and telecommunication technologies 
the company is also exploring whether other companies with their own technique dependent products would like to participate in the pie program  which would allow allocation of the marketing and sales costs over a number of different products 
while there has been interest in the pie program from other companies  there can be no assurance that cytogen can attract other products to the pie program  that this marketing strategy will be successful or that product related revenues will increase markedly 
in december and january  cytogen entered into agreements with faulding canada inc faulding and cis biointernational cisbio  respectively  to market and distribute oncoscint cr ov outside the us faulding is currently pursuing the necessary regulatory approvals in canada 
cisbio has advised the company that it expects to relaunch oncoscint cr ov during in eight western european countries and four eastern european countries where the product has been approved for marketing
