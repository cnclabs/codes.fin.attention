item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the company s actual results may differ significantly from projections in forward looking statements as a result of many factors 
varying climatic conditions can shift revenues between quarter 
weather also can affect operating revenues  seed costs  pest populations  the effectiveness of pesticides and seeds  seed production yields  commodity prices and growers planting decisions 
operating revenues also depend on a number of other factors  including market acceptance of products  competition and us and foreign government policies that affect crop acreage and farm income 
planted acreage is a key factor in determining volumes of seed  crop protection services and biopesticide products purchased by growers 
these and other factors may affect mycogen s ability to increase operating revenues and achieve profitability 
the company also must continue to invest in commercializing existing products and in discovery and development of new products  so the trend in losses from operations may continue 
the company s businesses are highly seasonal 
seed operating revenues are concentrated mainly in the second and third fiscal quarters which end february and may 
crop protection operating revenues are concentrated mainly in the third and fourth quarters which end in may and august 
results of operations summary mycogen develops and markets value added planting seeds for major agricultural crops and environmentally compatible biopesticide products and provides crop protection services to control pests and improve food and fiber production 
the company is organized into two business units  seed and crop protection 
mycogen s seed business  doing business as mycogen seeds  markets a complete line of planting seeds for major agricultural crops 
it ranks fourth in north america hybrid seed corn sales and among the top five in soybean  hybrid sunflower  hybrid sorghum and alfalfa 
using both traditional breeding and advanced biotechnology techniques  the company is moving rapidly to augment and improve the genetic makeup of major corps to produce seed products that give growers value added performance characteristics 
mycogen s cop protection business  mycogen crop protection  develops  manufactures and markets biopesticide products and provides crop protection services to growers of high value crops in california and arizona 
in december  mycogen was formed to use genetic engineering to develop environmentally compatible biological alternatives to chemical pesticides 
in january  the company acquired a line of fatty acid based pesticides to complement its line of microbial products 
in august  it acquired soilserv  a provider of crop protection services to growers in california and arizona  to establish a revenue base and to gain experience in crop protection practices 
during this time  mycogen continued to discover and develop a library of bt genes sequences that code for production of protein biotoxins with pesticidal activity 
in december  mycogen acquired of the agrigenetics division of lubrizol  which now does business as mycogen seeds 
the acquisition was driven by the opportunity to pool mycogen s and lubrizol s respective bt gene technology and plant science patent estates and technological expertise to develop pest resistant crops 
such crops are developed by inserting synthetic bt genes into plant cells 
plants regenerated from those transformed cells produce proteins that protect them from damage by certain pests 
once fixed in plant parent lines  this pest resistance trait is carried in planting seeds that are produced and marketed as value added products 
in december  the company acquired an additional of mycogen seeds  and in january  the company acquired lubrizol s remaining ownership interest in mycogen seeds 
as a result of the additional acquisition in  the company expensed  as special charges  certain acquired in process technologies which totaled million for the fiscal year ended august in august  the company combined certain biopesticide discovery and plant science research programs to accelerate development of pest resistant crops and completely restructured mycogen seeds 
when mycogen acquired agrigenetics  inc  it consisted of four independent seed companies selling products under ten different brand names 
in some areas  these independent seed companies competed against each other with the same products 
their businesses were based mainly on marketing seed products developed from publicly available parent lines as lower priced alternatives to premium priced seed products sold by other companies 
volumes and margins had declined each year and inventory was increasing and aging 
mycogen decided to consolidate these separate companies into one  mycogen seeds 
the company consolidated administration  production  sales  marketing and general management at the headquarters of the largest of the four companies in prescott  wisconsin 
mycogen also decided to eliminate all of the existing brand names and commercialize all seed products under the mycogen r brand  to eliminate overlapping sales territories and to replace older  lower value generic products with new  proprietary  value added products 
these changes resulted in restructuring charges totaling million for the fiscal year ended august this consolidation in improved efficiency and reduced expenses 
the number of separate seed corn products was reduced from to approximately  and the number of farmer dealers  at that time  was reduced from more than  to approximately  however  the elimination of familiar brands  heavy turnover in the sales force and repositioning of mycogen seeds from a discounter to a marketer of proprietary  value added products under a new brand created significant disruption in the business  and seed volumes and market share declined in additionally  mycogen seeds sales performance was adversely affected by a reduction in planted acres in many keys territories and crops 
all of these negative factors contributed to lower sales in mycogen entered into two major strategic alliances during fiscal year 
in december  mycogen and pioneer completed a technology sharing agreement which will allow mycogen to accelerate development of seed products for several pest resistant crops 
under the agreement  pioneer purchased three million shares of the company s common stock for million and has provided million in research and development funding 
pioneer will provide an additional million in funding near the end of the two companies also agreed to conduct a joint program to develop bt pest resistance technology for corn  soybean  sunflower  sorghum  canola and wheat 

in february  mycogen and dowelanco entered into a strategic alliance to build a global seeds business capable of conventional breeding as well as genetic engineering and to develop seed products with value added performance characteristics and qualities important to down stream users of grain and vegetable oils 
mycogen received million in cash and all of the shares of uas  dowelanco s seed subsidiary  in exchange for  shares of common stock 
as a result of this transaction  dowelanco s purchase of  shares of mycogen stock from lubrizol and subsequent purchases in the open market totaling  shares  dowelanco owns  as of august   approximately of the company s outstanding common stock 
these collaborations provided resources that allowed mycogen to acquire other strategic assets and accelerate steps toward its objective of developing a global seeds business  as follows 
in january  the company purchased rights from a subsidiary of lubrizol for million  giving mycogen freedom to commercialize its technology in certain oil seed crops 

during fiscal  mycogen spent million to upgrade seed production facilities 
these upgrades will allow the company to produce high quality seed products and reduce production costs 

in september  the company entered into a long term supply agreement with ac humko to provide crude high oleic sunflower oil 
high oleic oil increases product shelf life  which is an important quality for food processors 
in conjunction with this agreement  mycogen acquired lubrizol s remaining interest in oil seed technology and related assets for million in cash 

in september  mycogen purchased all of the common stock of morgan seeds for million in cash 
morgan seeds is the third largest seed company in argentina  and will provide a base from which mycogen can develop and commercialize seed products under the morgan r brand in south america 

in october  mycogen signed a letter of intent to enter into a strategic alliance with verneuil  a major european seed company 
mycogen and verneuil agreed to form separate joint ventures to develop and commercialize oil seed crops and seed corn resistant to european corn borer 
additionally  mycogen will exchange its european seeds business and other assets for an ownership interest in verneuil 
the alliance would provide a platform for commercializing mycogen s seed technology in europe 
mycogen s goals for fiscal were to reverse the decline in seed operating revenues by increasing sales of new  proprietary  value added corn hybrids  and to take advantage of its improved biopesticide cost position of its microbial products 
seed operating revenues  excluding the acquisition of uas  increased due to an estimated increase in planted us corn acres and higher sales of its new naturegard tm hybrid seed corn with genetically enhanced insect resistance and totally managed feedstuffs tm silage corn 
crop protection operating revenues were up and revenues from microbial based biopesticide products were up 
however  mycogen s initiatives to build a global seeds company had a negative effect on financial results in the following areas 
seed quality has become very important as mycogen transitions from discount priced generics to premium priced  value added  proprietary products 
therefore  the company raised quality standards to enhance performance of its new products 
as a result  seed discards were higher than anticipated and the company experienced shortages in some of its new premium products 
the amount of quality discards recorded in totaled million  the demand for these products was high  therefore  revenues and profits were adversely affected by the company s inability to provide more seed 

mycogen recorded special charges totaling million  related mainly to write offs of in process technology and obsolete or redundant facilities as a result of its acquisitions 
charges for amortization of other intangibles acquired also were higher 

mycogen recorded over million in excess and obsolete seed inventory write downs as a result of replacing older generic products with the new proprietary products 

mycogen also incurred increased expenses related to bringing the mycogen seeds and uas organizations together and upgrading the mycogen seeds management team to bring experience in managing value added  proprietary products 
mycogen seeds spent approximately million in unbudgeted operating expenses for items such as recruiting  relocation and severance  publicity  training and other programs supporting this effort 
mycogen will continue to pursue acquisitions and joint ventures to build its seeds business globally 
the company s strategy is focused on establishing and strengthening its presence in the world s largest and most productive growing regions by the year  so that it will have production and distribution in place to broadly commercialize second generation insect resistant and other value added products coming out of its r d pipeline 
segment operating revenues and operating loss years ended august  in thousands operating revenues seed corn    soybean    sunflower    sorghum    other    international    crop protection soilserv    biopesticides    intersegment  total operating revenues    operating income loss seed    crop protection  corporate    intersegment total operating loss    the net operating loss for the seed segment includes special charges of million and million in and  respectively 
seed segment fiscal year ended august compared to operating revenues seed operating revenues for the fiscal year ended august  were million  compared to million for fiscal the acquisition of uas accounted for million of the increase  primarily in corn and soybean seed sales 
the remaining increase of million or is attributable mainly to higher volumes  as follows 
higher planted corn acreage in and increased sales of naturegard tm corn hybrids with bt or native corn borer resistance and totally managed feedstuffs tm silage corn accounted for the majority of a million  or  increase in seed corn revenue 

sorghum volumes increased over  generating million in increased revenue 
this increase is largely attributable to droughts in texas  kansas and north dakota that damaged winter wheat crops  causing wheat acreage to be replanted with sorghum 

soybean revenues increased million  largely due to a more aggressive sales and marketing focus in and cooler  wetter weather in certain areas  which caused some farmers to plant soybean instead of corn 

offsetting these increases were lower domestic sunflower sales of million due to lower acreage planted in as a result of heavy disease pressure in north dakota and higher wheat and corn prices 

international operating revenues increased million  or  mainly due to higher sales of sunflower seed in argentina and seed corn in europe 
operating loss seed operating losses for the fiscal year ended august  excluding special charges of million  increased million compared to fiscal this deterioration in operating results  excluding uas  is attributable primarily to a million increase in sales and promotional expenses associated with the increase in sales volumes  legal fees of million incurred to enforce the company s patent position and lower gross margins of million 
excluding uas  higher gross margins from higher sales volumes were reduced by higher seed costs and higher product discards and obsolescence d o 
corn seed costs were per unit higher due to low production yields 
d o increased by million due to higher quantities of seed that did not pass quality standards and higher quantities of excess and obsolete seed inventory 
the company currently is a party to seven separate litigations arising out of disputes over patent and license rights for insect resistance and herbicide tolerance technology in plants 
the company will continue to assert and defend its positions in these matters  and therefore  will continue to incur significant legal expenses 
special charges special charges recognized during totaled million 
those charges are mainly comprised of impairment losses and exit costs of million related to the disposal and sale of certain corn production plant assets and write offs of acquired in process technology totaling million  including million for oil seed technology rights acquired from lubrizol and million related to the acquisition of uas 
the company is still evaluating programs related to that oil seed technology and has not yet committed significant funding 
the company expects that it will need to spend approximately million over the next three to five years to commercialize the uas technology 
the estimated funding and related efforts are within the normal course of research efforts typically required by uas s breeding and development programs 
fiscal year ended august compared to operating revenues seed operating revenues for the fiscal year ended august  were million compared to million for the fiscal year ended august the net million decrease in revenues was attributable mainly to lower volumes  as follows 
corn acres planted industry wide decreased from to  due to a cool  wet spring which caused growers either to not plant or to shift to other crops 
the company s corn volumes decreased 
although soybean acres industry wide were estimated to have been flat from to  the company s soybean volumes were down 
corn and soybean seed were the products most impacted by the company s decisions to consolidate marketing under a single brand and reduce the number of hybrids offered and the size of its farmer dealer network 

sunflower revenues increased a net  or 
million 
higher sales of confection sunflower and high oleic sunflower to a related party more than offset a decline in oil sunflower volume 
this decline in oil sunflower was due to disease and government programs which caused growers in certain territories where the company has a strong market presence to shift plantings from sunflower to wheat and canola 

sales volumes for other seed products  mainly sorghum and alfalfa  also were lower 
sorghum acreage continued to decline and shift to other crops  such as cotton 
the company believes that  as a result of the relatively mild winter in fiscal  an unusual amount of pasture survived the normal winter kill  which resulted in lower alfalfa sales 

international revenues increased  or million  due to higher corn and sunflower sales  mainly in france 
operating loss seed operating loss for the fiscal year ended august  was million compared to million excluding special charges of million for the fiscal year ended august  gross profit was million lower  due mainly to lower sales volumes and higher cost of operating revenues as a percent of sales 
cost of operating revenues was higher  due mainly to obsolescence as a result of repositioning corn inventory from non proprietary hybrids to new value added hybrids 
lower sales volumes were also responsible for increased unit fixed costs and costs incurred to dispose of excess and poor quality inventory 
expenses were slightly lower 
higher research and development expenses were partially offset by lower selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses resulting from a company wide restructuring and lower provisions for doubtful accounts 
crop protection segment fiscal year ended august compared to operating revenues crop protection operating revenues increased by million from to  as follows 
soilserv operating revenues were million higher than last year due to heavy insect pressure in salinas valley that increased sales of aerial applications and higher penetration of crop protection markets in arizona 

biopesticide operating revenues were up million  due to sales of new products  mattch tm bioinsecticide and scythe r bioherbicide  higher international sales of mvp r bioinsecticide and higher sales of mvp r concentrate to kubota corporation kubota 
lower sales of m pede r and m trak r bioinsecticides in north america  attributable to the introduction of new products by competitors  partially offset those increases 
operating income operating results improved million due to improved gross margins of million attributable to higher sales volumes coupled with lower biopesticide manufacturing costs 
higher operating expenses reduced operating income by 
million 
fiscal year ended august compared to operating revenues crop protection operating revenues for the fiscal year ended august  were million compared to million for fiscal  as follows 
soilserv operating revenues were up million in fiscal due to the flooding in california s salinas valley during the second quarter  resulting in heavy insect and disease pressure that increased the demand for soilserv s aerial pesticide applications 

biopesticide operating revenues were up million  or  due to the introduction of scythe r herbicide and increases in sales of mvp r for control of heliothis in cotton and m peril r for control of european corn borer in corn 
international sales of biopesticides increased due to expanded sales of mvp r liquid in asia and mvp r concentrate to kubota 
operating loss crop protection operating losses for the fiscal year ended august   were million  compared to 
million for fiscal the increase in operating losses was due mainly to a million write down of crop protection technology resulting from the discontinuation of a certain product development program 
contract and other revenues declined million 
these decreases were partially offset by higher margins 
soilserv margins improved in total and as a percent of sales due to higher volumes 
corporate fiscal year ended august compared to the increase of million in the corporate operating loss was due to higher compensation and bonuses and expenses related to general research and development activities 
fiscal year ended august compared to the reduction of million in the corporate operating loss from million in to million in was due to lower general and administrative expenses resulting from the consolidation and allocation of corporate general and administrative resources to the seed business during the restructuring of mycogen seeds operations 
non operating items interest income and expense  net interest income and expense  net  increased million to million in fiscal due to higher net interest income as a result of more cash available for investment during the year 
interest income and expense  net  decreased million to 
million in the decrease was due mainly to less cash available for investment and higher levels of borrowing under the company s line of credit during other income other income of 
million was recognized in upon receipt of a litigation settlement 
minority interest effective december   the company agreed to purchase the remaining ownership interest in mycogen seeds from lubrizol 
lubrizol s minority interest in mycogen seeds was recorded at the minimum agreed upon purchase price and mycogen seeds operating results have been recognized since that time as if the company owned of mycogen seeds 
therefore  no minority interest was recognized for periods after december  liquidity and capital resources the company s cash  cash equivalents and securities available for sale increased by million to million during the fiscal year ended august this increase was primarily due to proceeds of million  million and million from the sale of common stock to pioneer  dowelanco and employees  respectively  and million in research funding from pioneer 
these proceeds were reduced by cash used to pay off million of long term debt  cash paid to lubrizol for technology rights of million  cash paid to dowelanco of million in connection with the acquisition of uas and capital expenditures which totaled million 
the company has a million bank line of credit facility  which expires november  the credit facility is used to fund portions of the company s seasonal working capital needs  million was unused as of august  the company is currently renegotiating the terms  including an extension  of its credit facility 
in december  the company signed a definitive agreement for a technology collaboration with pioneer 
under the agreement  pioneer purchased three million shares of the company s common stock for million and provided million in research and development funding 
pioneer will provide an additional million in funding near the end of in january  lubrizol converted its entire interest in shares of preferred stock into  shares of mycogen common stock and sold its ownership interest in mycogen seeds to the company for  shares of common stock 
the company also purchased certain rights in oil seed technology from a subsidiary of lubrizol for million 
the company made an initial payment of million and will pay million and million in january and  respectively 
in february  the company issued common stock to dowelanco in exchange for million in cash and all of the shares in uas 
during fiscal  the company invested million to upgrade seed production facilities  and expects to invest another million during fiscal to add additional seed processing capacity 
the company also invested million in fiscal to build a new headquarters for mycogen seeds and expects to spend about million during the first quarter of fiscal to complete construction 
other capital expenditures totaled million for fiscal  and are expected to total million during fiscal in september  the company purchased all of the common stock of morgan seeds for million in cash and acquired lubrizol s remaining interest in oil seed technology and certain related assets for million in cash 
the company will continue to pursue an aggressive acquisition and joint venture strategy for both the seed and crop protection business units 
the company is involved in various actions related to its patent positions and plans to continue to spend resources as required to enforce its intellectual property rights 
the company s success will depend in part on its ability to obtain us and foreign patent protection for its products 
to date  mycogen has obtained numerous patents and has filed a large number of patent applications in the united states and foreign jurisdictions relating to the company s technology 
there can be no assurance that issued patent claims will be sufficient to protect the company s technology 
the commercial success of the company also will depend in part on the company s ability to avoid infringing patents issued to competitors 
if licenses are required  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to obtain such licenses on commercially favorable terms  if at all 
litigation  which can result in substantial cost to the company  may also be necessary to enforce the company s intellectual property rights or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
the company anticipates that its current cash position  revenue from operations and contract and other revenues  and funds from its existing line of credit will be sufficient to finance working capital and capital requirements for the immediate future 
however  the company s capital requirements may vary as a result of competitive and technological developments  the timing of regulatory approval for new products and the terms and conditions of any future strategic transactions 
if such requirements change  the company may need to raise additional capital 
however  there can be no assurance that the company can raise additional capital under favorable terms  if at all
