item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction was a year of progress for tosco 
excluding special items  operating results improved over despite lower refinery operating margins  a testament to tosco s successful strategy to diversify the company s asset base by expanding downstream into retail 
tosco increased the number of company operated stations  acquired under long term lease brown bear car wash sites in the puget sound area  and entered into an agreement to acquire bp oil s northeast marketing and refining assets which was completed in february tosco s balance sheet was also strengthened as the ratio of long term debt to total capitalization dropped below for the first time since when tosco entered into its period of rapid growth 
tosco took initial steps in transitioning to an unsecured debt structure through the issuance of million of unsecured notes to pay down collateralized floating rate bank debt and through an agreement to sell receivables to a financial institution 
west coast administrative operations were also consolidated to achieve efficiencies

excluding special items  tosco generated an operating contribution income before selling  general and administrative expense  net interest expense and income taxes for of million  an increase of million over the increase was primarily attributable to the excellent production operations of the avon and bayway refineries  lower production costs  moderately higher east coast operating margins  and the continued strong performance of expanded retail operations which more than offset declines in west coast refinery operating margins and reduced production from the ferndale refinery

f restated to reflect operating contribution per charge barrel sales minus cost of sales  excluding refinery operating costs and non operating items divided by total refinery charges 
the avon refinery s operating contribution declined from due to poor operating margins that overshadowed record production 
the fluid catalytic cracking unit catcracker  avon s principal gasoline production unit  was shutdown for major scheduled maintenance for days in the first quarter of  negatively impacting clean product yields for the year 
despite the catcracker shutdown  crude oil processed averaged  barrels per day b d  an increase of  b d over and the highest in avon s history 
production of clean transportation fuels gasoline  diesel and jet fuel increased by  b d to  b d 
however  avon s operating margin per charge barrel declined by 
to per barrel for as excess supply in highly competitive markets depressed product prices  particularly in the first quarter of in response to continuing poor operating margins  tosco implemented a restructuring program to reduce costs and increase efficiency 
the restructuring cost of million  recorded in the first and second quarters of  was primarily for the then anticipated severance costs of approximately people at the avon refinery and related support locations 
bayway s operating contribution for improved over due to record refinery production rates  higher margins  and lower production costs 
raw material throughput increased  b d to a record  b d  while production of clean transportation fuels and heating oil also increased  b d to a record  b d 
expanded crude distillation capacity completed in and record production unit rates of the fluid catalytic cracking unit  the world s largest and bayway s principal gasoline production unit  were the principal reasons for the record production rates 
the catcracker was shutdown for scheduled turnaround maintenance in bayway s operating margin per charge barrel improved 
per barrel for the year  primarily during the second half of as a result of increased sale prices 
operating margins for the year were hurt by the exceptionally weak market conditions of the first quarter of caused by the combined impact of a surplus of heating oil and poor gasoline markets 
operating margins improved during the balance of the year as demand strengthened and uncertainty over the introduction of reformulated gasoline rfg subsided 
operating contribution from tosco northwest  whose operations encompass retail marketing operations and the ferndale refinery  declined from the decrease was primarily due to poor refining margins and the shutdown of the refinery for days for turnaround maintenance during the first quarter of ferndale s operating margin per charge barrel declined 
per barrel and refinery throughput declined  b d to  b d 
retail operations generated an operating contribution of million for  an increase of million from retail volumes sold increased  b d to  b d due to the acquisitions of retail operations in northern california and arizona in august and december  respectively 
retail gasoline margins remained approximately the same at 
per gallon for and selling  general  and administrative expense sg a for increased by million to due to tosco s expanded retail operations and higher levels of incentive compensation due to higher levels of operating income before special items which was partially offset by certain benefit recoveries 
sg a expense for was reduced by insurance recoveries of million related to now settled litigation with the predecessor owners of the avon refinery over environmental matters and million related to a retroactive adjustment of prior year medical costs based on favorable claim experience 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in june  tosco entered into a three year agreement with a financial institution to sell on a revolving basis up to million of an undivided percentage ownership interest in a designated pool of accounts receivable receivable transfer agreement 
costs of the receivable transfer agreement  which totaled million for six months less than interest costs would have been on equivalent cash borrowings under tosco s revolving credit agreement  are included in cost of sales 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense increased in  despite the reduction in interest costs resulting from the receivable transfer agreement  due to higher debt levels related to tosco s expanded operations 
the provision for income taxes for increased by 
million despite lower pre tax income because the tax provision for included recognition of revised income tax benefits of million related to tosco s discontinued fertilizer operations 
results of operations tosco earned million  or per fully diluted share  on sales of billion for compared to million or per fully diluted share  on sales of billion for despite income rising million  earnings per fully diluted share for fell by 
per share because of the issuance of  shares of common stock in december results of operations for include the reversal of s million writedown of lifo inventories due to the recovery of prices during tosco also recorded a million environmental cost accrual for probable investigative and remedial liabilities at former operating locations 
tosco s acquisitions and expanded wholesale operations were the principal reasons for the increase in sales and cost of sales for compared to in april  tosco purchased the bayway refinery and related assets from exxon corporation 
in december  tosco acquired  through long term lease  northville industries long island  new york oil distribution system and purchased the ferndale refinery and retail marketing operations in the pacific northwest from bp exploration oil inc bp 
in august and mid december  tosco expanded its retail system through the acquisition  under long term lease arrangements  of the retail marketing operations of bp in northern california and exxon in arizona  respectively 
tosco generated an operating contribution before special items for of million from its three refineries and retail marketing operations  an increase of million over tosco northwest produced an operating contribution of million in its initial year of operations due to strong retail margins  good production results from the ferndale refinery  and good refining margins in the pacific northwest 
the ferndale refinery processed  b d of raw materials for  a  b d improvement over production results under previous management 
operating margins per charge barrel were for due to strong product prices  especially for residual fuels  while retail margins averaged 
per gallon on sales volume of million gallons per day 
the avon refinery and its related commercial operations experienced a decline in operating contribution from due to reduced production levels and poor operating margins 
raw material throughput rates for fell by  b d to  b d while production of clean transportation fuels fell by  b d to  b d 
scheduled turnaround maintenance on the fluid coker  which was completed during the second quarter of  was the primary reason for the fall in production 
tosco also reduced production levels in early december in response to poor operating margins and to prepare for an early start of the major upgrade and turnaround of the catcracker which occurred in january avon s operating margins per charge barrel for declined by to  the lowest since increases in raw material costs were not matched by increases in product prices because of excess supply  highly competitive markets  and the lingering effects of the recession in california  avon s principal market  which lagged the improvement in the national economy 
bayway s operating contribution for includes the reversal of the million writedown of lifo inventories recorded in excluding the inventory valuation  bayway s operating contribution for declined from the approximate nine month operating period of the decline in operating contribution was primarily due to reduced production  weak operating margins and higher distribution costs 
raw materials processed declined by  b d to  b d while production of clean transportation fuels and heating oil declined by  b d to  b d due to scheduled turnaround maintenance of the catcracker  during the third quarter of bayway also reduced production runs in early december in response to weak operating margins in the northeast and to perform some minor but necessary maintenance of production units 
operating margins per charge barrel averaged for the year  a decline of 
from bayway  like avon  was not able to match increases in raw material costs with comparable increases in product prices  due to excess supply in highly competitive markets 
in addition  fourth quarter margins were negatively impacted by mild winter weather and market uncertainty over the introduction of cleaner burning but higher cost reformulated gasoline rfg 
certain areas in the northeast elected to opt out  and were permitted to do so by the federal government  of their voluntary participation in the rfg program mandated by federal regulations for the largest metropolitan areas of the united states 
operating costs were also impacted by higher distribution costs as bayway expanded its terminal distribution network and commercial operations 
selling  general and administrative expense for increased by million to million due to tosco s expanded operations 
the increase in net interest expense for is primarily due to higher levels of debt related to tosco s acquisitions and their associated working capital requirements and higher short term interest rates 
the provision for income taxes for reflects a reduction in the annual effective income tax rate and recognition of million of revised income tax benefits related to tosco s former activities 
the effective rate reduction is attributable to revised state income tax allocation factors and estimated california investment tax credits 
the provision for income taxes for included prior year tax credits of approximately million which were finalized in tax returns filed in october results of operations tosco s continuing operations earned million  or per fully diluted share  on sales of billion for as compared to income from continuing operations of million  or 
per fully diluted share  on sales of billion for continuing operations exclude the results of tosco s former phosphate fertilizer operations 
tosco s operating contribution of million for  after an inventory writedown of million  increased by million over due to a million increase in operating contribution from avon and its related commercial activities and an operating contribution of million from bayway and its related commercial activities 
avon s improvement in operating contribution was primarily attributable to record production rates  improved operating margins and lower environmental cost accruals  partially offset by the increased refinery and product distribution costs associated with higher levels of production 
raw material throughput rates averaged a then record  b d for versus  b d for and production of clean transportation fuels also averaged a record  b d versus  b d for 
operating margins improved by 
to per barrel as per barrel costs of raw materials fell by more than the sales value of refined products produced 
the improved margins achieved despite the sluggish economy  especially in california were assisted by the completion and start up of facilities for the production of low sulfur  low aromatic diesel fuel meeting the california air resources board s carb cleaner burning fuel standards effective october  bayway achieved an operating contribution of million  after an inventory writedown of million  for the period april  to december  due to strong refinery performance in a period of lackluster margins 
raw material throughput averaged  b d while production of clean transportation fuels and heating oil  and total production averaged  and  b d  respectively 
operating margins  including net realized results of hedges  averaged per barrel 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expense of million for increased by million over primarily due to the acquisition of bayway including approximately million of non recurring costs incurred in establishing commercial  accounting and general and administrative functions at bayway 
consolidated net interest expense for of million increased by million over net interest expense for includes million of intercompany interest income from discontinued operations and the writeoff of approximately million of deferred financing costs related to previously outstanding indebtedness 
without the effect of these two items  consolidated net interest expense for increased by million as the costs of higher levels of debt resulting from the purchase of bayway and its associated working capital requirements more than offset the benefits of lower interest rates 
the provision for income taxes for includes the increase in federal income tax rates effective january  as well as tax credits of approximately million which were finalized in tax returns filed in october acquisitions on february   tosco completed the purchase of the us northeast marketing and refining assets from bp for million  excluding the value of inventories 
under the purchase agreement  tosco obtained an exclusive license valid for years  with various renewal options  to market retail gasoline and diesel fuels under the bp brand 
the license covers delaware  maryland  the washington d 
c 
metropolitan area  pennsylvania  new jersey  new york  connecticut  rhode island  massachusetts  vermont  new hampshire and maine 
portions of western pennsylvania and maryland are excluded 
the term of tosco s exclusive license in nine western states was also extended to years from the closing date 
the purchase also included the  b d marcus hook refinery near philadelphia which was taken over in a non operating mode  petroleum product terminals and certain associated pipeline interests some of which are surplus to tosco s needs and will be sold 
tosco has also offered to buy bp s one third interest in the harbor pipeline on which bp s partners have a right of first refusal to acquire bp s interest 
bp retains environmental obligations relating to the marcus hook refinery and other properties included in the sale 
on february   tosco announced an agreement to purchase all outstanding shares of the circle k corporation circle k for per share and to merge circle k with a subsidiary of tosco 
circle k is a large gasoline retailer and operator of company owned convenience stores 
a definitive agreement was signed with the holders of approximately of circle k s outstanding shares selling shareholders and a merger agreement was approved by the board of directors of both companies 
under the stock purchase agreement  selling shareholders will receive a combination of cash and common stock of tosco common stock 
under the merger agreement the remaining shareholders will receive common stock 
payment of the total acquisition price of approximately million  not including transaction and certain other costs  will consist of approximately million shares of common stock and cash 
the common stock to be issued is subject to adjustment if the price of common stock fluctuates outside an agreed range and for shares issued with respect to stock options held by certain employees of circle k 
tosco expects to finance the cash requirements from borrowings under contemplated new debt arrangements and from available cash and credit facilities 
completion of the transaction is subject to certain conditions including the approvals of regulatory authorities and the shareholders of circle k 
the acquisition is expected to close prior to mid year 
outlook results of operations are determined by two principal factors the operating efficiency of the refineries and refining and retail operating margins 
scheduled major maintenance of avon s cat cracker and the processing units at ferndale in the first quarter of completed a cycle of heavy turnaround maintenance 
accordingly  tosco s currently operating refineries are expected to operate at high production levels for the marcus hook refinery is expected to remain in a non operating mode in margins at the beginning of were satisfactory but tosco is not able to predict the level or trend of refinery and retail operating margins because of the uncertainties associated with oil markets 
tosco  and other refiners  made significant capital expenditures to meet the cleaner burning rfg gasoline standards of the california air resources board carb effective march  carb phase ii gasoline 
tosco also entered into a year arrangement with chevron products company which provides tosco  b d of carb phase ii gasoline for  b d of conventional gasoline plus differentials 
tosco is not certain that the higher cost of carb phase ii gasoline will be fully recovered in higher sales prices 
in november  the year ban on the export of alaskan north slope ans crude oil  a primary source of raw material for west coast refineries  was lifted 
this action may lead to higher costs for ans and other domestic crude oils 
in january  atlantic richfield company arco informed tosco that it would not extend its ten year exchange agreement when it expires at the end of under the exchange agreement  arco presently delivers  b d of ans crude oil to the avon refinery in exchange for a variable quantity of gasoline 
the economic effects of the termination are uncertain 
however  tosco expects to acquire alternative suppliers and customers including its own expanded retail operations to replace arco when the exchange agreement expires 
in view of uncertain operating margins and highly competitive markets  tosco is committed to improving its results by lowering costs in all areas of operation 
restructuring efforts taken in the first half of produced reductions in unit operating costs at the avon refinery 
these efforts are continuing 
west coast operating and administrative functions were consolidated in late and the company was reorganized into functional organizations in february the acquisition of circle k will also allow further economies of scale 
to reduce tosco s exposure to fluctuations in refinery operating margins  tosco has at times used futures contracts and other derivatives to lock in what it considered to be acceptable refinery operating margins on a varying percentage of future production 
at december   tosco had hedged approximately of bayway s expected first quarter and annual production at acceptable historical margins 
tosco s expansion and diversification into retail marketing has been successful in providing earnings growth and stability 
the acquisition of circle k  which tosco expects to be additive to tosco s per share earnings after the combined operations are fully integrated  advances tosco s goal of becoming a major gasoline retailer 
it adds convenient store operations  a third major related component to tosco s petroleum refining and gasoline retail business 
cash flows and liquidity as summarized in the statement of cash flows  cash decreased by million during as cash used in investing and financing activities of million and million  respectively  exceeded cash provided by operating activities of million 
cash provided by operating activities of million was from cash earnings of million net income plus depreciation  amortization  and deferred income taxes plus a decrease in working capital of million and million from other sources 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million  primarily for capital additions and deferred turnaround expenditures of million and million  respectively and increases in other assets primarily trademarks of million 
cash used in financing activities totaled million as net repayments under short term bank lines and the revolving credit facility of million  dividend payments of million and debt and other payments totaling million exceeded proceeds from the notes of million 
liquidity as measured by cash  short term investments and deposits and unused credit facilities increased by million during due to an increase of million in unused credit facilities partially offset by a decrease in cash  cash equivalents  short term deposits and investments of million 
at december   liquidity totaled million an amount when supplemented by cash borrowings under contemplated new debt arrangements to finance the circle k acquisition  tosco believes is adequate to meet its expected liquidity demands for at least the next twelve months 
capital expenditures and capitalization tosco spent million on budgeted capital projects in tosco and bp also entered into an agreement to settle contingent participation payments related to the acquisition of bp s pacific northwest refining and retail assets for million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
a large portion of capital spending on refinery projects was related to the avon refinery s clean fuels program to meet the carb phase ii specifications 
the multi year project  which was completed on time and on budget  converts a significant portion of avon s gasoline production to carb phase ii gasoline 
with the exchange of conventional gasoline for carb phase ii gasoline with chevron  approximately of avon s gasoline production will meet carb phase ii specifications 
other refinery capital expenditures continued to address required environmental and safety programs 
the balance of tosco s refinery capital investments targeted discretionary low cost  high return projects to lower operating costs  improve refinery throughput or yields  or increase operating flexibility and reliability 
bayway s fuel products controls were improved with the installation of a modern state of the art refinery control system 
the new computer system  which monitors and directs all refinery production processes  has resulted in better production levels and yields with greater reliability  safety and environmental compliance 
bayway refining company has entered into a contract to acquire a solvent deasphalter for approximately million  plus the cost of agreed upon modifications and interest  at mechanical completion as defined 
construction of this unit began in and mechanical completion is expected in the third quarter of tosco is responsible for other capital improvements to tie in the solvent deasphalter into the bayway refinery system raising the total expected cost of the unit to approximately million 
when completed  this unit will process approximately  b d of lower valued residual fuel to produce feedstock for the refinery s fluid catalytic cracker and reduce the amount of higher cost  partially refined feedstocks that bayway currently purchases from third parties 
in may  tosco announced a three year  million capital program to expand its western retail operations through the development of new  and enhancement of existing  retail facilities in existing and new markets  the acquisition of existing stations or systems  and development of new jobber business 
in august  tosco entered into an agreement to expand an existing lease facility to finance the acquisition and improvement of up to million of service station properties in arizona 
at december   tosco  as agent for the lessor  had spent approximately million but had not yet entered into leases pending completion of construction 
in november  tosco acquired under long term lease the brown bear car wash facilities in the puget sound area 
the pending acquisition of circle k has curtailed further expansion plans 
capital spending will now be focused on improving present sites that can be financed from internal cash flows 
tosco expects to fund its capital expenditures for its refineries from cash provided by operations  available credit  and other resources 
in view of the pending acquisition of circle k  capital spending for retail operations will be refocused on the enhancement of existing retail sites and the intergration  after the acquisition  of both operations 
to increase financial flexibility and reduce interest costs  tosco amended its working capital agreement in april  entered into a receivable transfer agreement in june  and issued million of unsecured notes in july tosco is contemplating other financing alternatives to improve its financial capacity and flexibility  including a new unsecured credit facility to be used for general corporate purposes and  to partially fund the circle k acquisition  a million public debt offering 
at december   total shareholders equity was million  an increase from december  of million due to net income million less dividend and other payments million 
debt  including current maturities and short term bank borrowings  decreased by million to million at the end of impact of inflation the impact of inflation has been less significant during recent years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states 
raw material costs  energy costs  and labor costs are important components of tosco s costs 
any or all of these components could be increased by inflation  with a possible adverse effect on profitability  especially in high inflation periods when raw material and energy cost increases generally lead finished product prices 
in addition  a rapid escalation of raw material and finished products prices could result in credit restrictions if working capital requirements exceed the maximum availability under tosco s working capital facilities 
risk management tosco uses a variety of strategies to reduce commodity price  interest and operational risks 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  tosco  at times and when able  uses futures contracts to lock in what it believes to be favorable margins on a varying portion of bayway s production by taking offsetting long obligation to buy at a fixed price positions in crude oil and short obligation to deliver at a fixed price positions in gasoline and heating oil futures and forward contracts 
this strategy hedges bayway s exposure to fluctuations in refining margins and therefore reduces the volatility of operating results 
in addition  tosco enters into swap contracts with counterparties typically agreeing to sell at fixed forward prices  and to buy at future variable market prices  stated volumes of residual fuels to hedge sales prices of the bayway refinery s residual fuels production 
at december   bayway had hedged approximately of its expected first quarter and annual production  respectively  at acceptable historical margins 
tosco utilizes futures and forward contracts to a lesser extent to hedge inventories stored for future sale and to hedge against adverse price movements between the cost of foreign crude oil that bayway refines and the cost of domestic crude oil 
tosco manages its interest rate risk by maintaining a mix of fixed rate and floating rate debt 
currently  floating rate debt  primarily borrowings under the revolving credit facilities which provide up to million of revolving credit availability  is used to finance tosco s working capital requirements 
existing fixed rate debt consists primarily of million unsecured non callable notes issued in july to repay indebtedness under the revolving credit facilities and million of mortgage bonds issued in and to refinance previously outstanding floating rate bank debt and to finance the acquisition of capital assets including the acquisition of the bayway refinery 
as required by the previously outstanding bank debt agreement  tosco entered into an interest rate swap agreement which converted a predetermined percentage of floating rate bank term debt million at december  to fixed rate term debt 
the interest rate swap expires in the second quarter of tosco carries insurance policies on insurable risks  which it believes to be appropriate at commercially reasonable rates 
while tosco believes that it is adequately insured  future losses could exceed insurance policy limits or  under adverse interpretations  be excluded from coverage 
future liability or costs  if any  incurred under such circumstances would have to be paid out of general corporate funds  if available 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of tosco s strategy to reduce credit risk
