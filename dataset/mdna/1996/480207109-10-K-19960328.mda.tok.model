the cable television industry generally measures the financial performance of a cable television system in terms of cash flow or operating income before depreciation and amortization 
the value of a cable television system is often determined using multiples of cash flow 
this measure is not intended to be a substitute or improvement upon the items disclosed on the financial statements  rather it is included because it is an industry standard 
operating income before depreciation and amortization increased  or approximately percent  to  in from  in this increase was due to the increases in revenues exceeding the increases in operating expenses and management fees and allocated overhead from the general partner

financial condition the partnership s capital expenditures for totaled approximately  approximately percent of these expenditures related to the extension and rebuild of cable plant 
service drops to homes accounted for approximately percent of such expenditures 
the remainder of the capital expenditures related to various enhancements in the partnership s independence system 
funding for these expenditures was provided primarily by cash generated from operations and borrowings from the partnership s revolving credit facility 
anticipated capital expenditures for are approximately  the continuation of the rebuild of the independence system is expected to account for approximately percent of the anticipated capital expenditures 
service drops connecting new subscribers are expected to account for approximately percent 
the remainder of the expenditures will relate to various enhancements in the independence system 
funding for these capital improvements is expected to be provided by cash generated from operations and borrowings from the partnership s revolving credit facility 
the maximum amount available under the partnership s revolving credit facility is subject to the terms of the credit agreement and the partnership agreement s leverage limitations discussed below 
the maximum amount available under the partnership s revolving credit facility is  as of december    was outstanding  leaving  of available borrowings for future needs

percent  the certificate of deposit rate plus percent or the euro rate plus percent 
the effective interest rates on amounts outstanding as of december  and were percent and percent  respectively 
the level of borrowings allowed by the partnership s limited partnership agreement is percent of the fair market value of the partnership s assets at the time of borrowing or percent of the cost of the partnership s assets at the time of borrowing  whichever is higher 
this limitation may restrict the partnership s ability to borrow funds for capital expenditures and to make distributions 
in addition  such limitation may reduce the financial flexibility and liquidity of the partnership 
further  the payment of the principal and interest on outstanding debt obligations will diminish the level of funds available to the partnership and reduce the financial flexibility of the partnership 
the partnership s most recent appraisal of the independence system was  based upon this appraised value  the partnership has a borrowing capacity of approximately  which would allow the partnership to borrow the maximum amount  currently available under its credit facility 
the partnership declared a 
per unit distribution for each of the four quarters of the partnership intends to distribute all cash flow from operations after payment of expenses  capital additions and creation of cash reserves deemed reasonably necessary to preserve and enhance the value of the partnership s cable television system 
the general partner believes that the partnership has sufficient sources of capital to service its presently anticipated needs from cash on hand  cash generated from operations and borrowings available under its revolving credit facility 
regulation and legislation the partnership has filed a cost of service showing in response to rulemakings concerning the cable act for its independence system and thus anticipates no further reductions in rates in this system 
the cost of service showing has not yet received final approvals from regulatory authorities  however  and there can be no assurance that the partnership s cost of service showing will prevent further rate reductions in the independence system until such final approval is received 
the telecommunications act of the act  which became law on february   substantially revised the communications act of  as amended  including the cable act and the cable act  and has been described as one of the most significant changes in communications regulation since the original communications act of the act is intended  in part  to promote substantial competition in the telephone local exchange and in the delivery of video and other services 
as a result of the act  local telephone companies also known as local exchange carriers or lecs and other service providers are permitted to provide video programming  and cable television operators are permitted entry into the telephone local exchange market 
the fcc is required to conduct rulemaking proceedings over the next several months to implement various provisions of the act 
among other provisions  the act modified the cable act by deregulating the cable programming service tier of large cable operators including the partnership effective march  and the cable programming service tier of small cable operators in systems providing service to  or fewer subscribers effective immediately 
the act also revised the procedures for filing cable programming service tier rate complaints and adds a new effective competition test 
it is premature to predict the specific effects of the act on the cable industry in general or the partnership in particular 
the fcc will be undertaking numerous rulemaking proceedings to interpret and implement the act 
it is not possible at this time to predict the outcome of those proceedings or their effect on the partnership
