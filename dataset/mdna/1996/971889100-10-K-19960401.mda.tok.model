average production costs per boe sales prices received by the company for oil and gas have fluctuated significantly from period to period 
the fluctuations in oil prices during these periods primarily reflected market uncertainty regarding the inability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to control the production of its member countries  as well as concerns related to global supply and demand for crude oil

it is impossible to predict future price movements with certainty

the sec defines proved oil and gas reserves as those estimated quantities of crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
proved developed oil and gas reserves are those that can be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods

future price changes are considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements 
estimated future development and production costs are determined by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year  based on year end costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions 
estimated future income tax expenses are calculated by applying year end statutory tax rates adjusted for permanent differences and tax credits to estimated future pretax net cash flows related to proved oil and gas reserves  less the tax basis of the properties involved 
these estimates are furnished and calculated in accordance with requirements of the financial accounting standards board and the sec 
due to unpredictable variances in expenses and capital forecasts  crude oil and natural gas price changes and the fact that the basis for such estimates vary significantly  management believes the usefulness of these projections is limited 
estimates of future net cash flows do not represent management s assessment of future profitability or future cash flow to the company 
management s investment and operating decisions are based upon reserve estimates that include proved reserves prescribed by the sec as well as probable reserves  and upon different price and cost assumptions from those used here 
it should be recognized that applying current costs and prices at a percent standard discount rate allows for comparability but does not convey absolute value 
the discounted amounts arrived at are only one measure of financial quantification of proved reserves 
there were no oil and gas estimates filed with or included in reports to any other federal or foreign governmental authority or agency within the last twelve months 
reserves in the united states were estimated by ramsey engineering inc and the company 
reserves in canada were estimated by citidal engineering  ltd
