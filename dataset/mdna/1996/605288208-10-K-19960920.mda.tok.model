item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company s results of operations have historically been influenced by a number of factors beyond the company s control which have  at times  had a significant effect on the company s operating results 
fertilizer demand and prices are highly dependent upon conditions in the agricultural industry and can be affected by a variety of factors  including planted acreage  united states government agricultural policies  projected grain stocks  weather and changes in agricultural production methods 
the company s results can be affected by such factors as the relative value of the us dollar  foreign agricultural policies in particular the policies of the governments of india and china regarding subsidies of fertilizer imports  and the hard currency demands of countries such as the former soviet union 
the company s fiscal results reflect record sales  operating income and net income 
net sales increased to million from million in operating income increased to million from million in  and net income increased to million from million in these results reflect higher sales prices for nitrogen and dap and higher sales volumes for all product groups 
sales volumes were favorably impacted by a carryover effect caused by slow product movement resulting from adverse weather conditions in may and june of these increases were partially offset by lower ammonium nitrate sales volumes during the current year due to the absence of tonnage obtained through a contract with air products and chemicals  inc air products  in the prior fiscal year  which is no longer in effect 
the company purchased approximately  tons of ammonium nitrate from air products in fiscal compared to  tons during fiscal the average sales price per ton of nitrogen fertilizer increased to in fiscal from in fiscal for fiscal  the average sales price of dap was per ton compared to per ton for fiscal the average sales price of potash decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal during the current year  a favorable worldwide supply demand balance for nitrogen and dap fertilizers caused sales prices to increase 
however  during the fourth quarter  adverse weather patterns affected spring demand and resulted in lower than expected sales volumes for the company s products 
in response  nitrogen prices  particularly ammonia and urea  weakened 
looking forward  fertilizer market fundamentals remain strong 
us and world grain stocks continue at their lowest level in more than two decades 
total acreage planted during fiscal increased more than million acres over last year s levels  and industry analysts expect a further increase in planted acres for this  coupled with rising global food demand  should translate into high levels of fertilizer consumption for the upcoming fiscal year 
prices for natural gas  a significant raw material in the production of nitrogen fertilizers  have risen significantly since december much of the recent increase is attributed to difficulties in replenishing natural gas inventories following the harsh winter of although long term natural gas supplies appear adequate to meet projected demand  gas prices can be significantly influenced by short term fundamentals such as weather  storage levels  gas transportation interruptions and competing fuel prices 
this price volatility is expected to continue
