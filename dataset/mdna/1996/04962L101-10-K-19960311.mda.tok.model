depending on the results of the company s research and development activities  the company may determine to accelerate or expand its efforts in one or more of its proposed areas and may therefore require additional funds earlier than presently anticipated

such funds will be needed to construct additional facilities and to hire manufacturing and marketing personnel

if the company cannot raise additional capital  on terms acceptable to the company  the company will be forced to  among other things  curtail its research and development activities  delay or terminate activities with respect to implementation of manufacturing  sales and marketing plans and reduce its personnel levels 
the company s long term success depends on sales of products that must undergo an extensive regulatory approval process 
there can be no assurance that regulatory agency approvals will be obtained for any products or drugs developed or discovered by the company  or that the company will be successful in developing any products or drugs
