it has no substantial recurring cash requirements other than payment of interest and principal on its debt  tax payments and corporate overhead expenses 
the parent maintains the principal borrowings for the company and its non banking subsidiaries and has provided working capital to certain of its subsidiaries 
these borrowings have primarily been made on an unsecured basis from banks through various credit agreement facilities and term loans  and through public financings 
during the year ended december   the company used a portion of its  bank credit agreement facilities in connection with the mk gold transaction and to meet daily cash requirements 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under such bank credit agreement facilities 
the company s bank borrowings bear interest based on the prime rate or libor 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk related to its variable rate borrowings 
the company has entered into interest rate swap and interest rate option agreements to reduce the impact of changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
counterparties to these agreements are major financial institutions  which the company believes are able to fulfill their obligations  however  if they are not  the company believes that any losses are unlikely to be material 
in june  the company sold  principal amount of its newly authorized senior subordinated notes due in an underwritten public offering 
a portion of the proceeds was used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the company s bank credit agreement facilities incurred in connection with the mk gold transaction

in connection with such public offering  the company granted the underwriters an over allotment option  which was exercised  for  common shares 
under the terms of the warrant agreement  the company was required to pay expenses of the sale  other than underwriting discounts 
as a result of the exercise of the warrants and the exercise of the over allotment option  the company realized aggregate cash proceeds  net of expenses  of  for income tax purposes  the exercise of the warrants results in the company receiving a current income tax deduction of  for financial reporting purposes  the benefit of such deduction  was credited directly to shareholders equity

because of the tax loss carryforwards available to the parent and certain subsidiaries  together with current interest deductions and corporate expenses  the amount paid by the parent for income taxes is substantially less than tax sharing payments received from its subsidiaries 
in addition  the parent receives payments from the regulated and non regulated entities for services provided by the parent 
payments from regulated subsidiaries for dividends  tax sharing payments and other services totaled approximately  during the year ended december  based on discussions with commercial and investment bankers  the company believes that it has the ability to raise additional funds under acceptable conditions for use in its existing businesses or for appropriate investment opportunities 
since  the company s senior debt obligations have been rated as investment grade by moody s  s p and duff phelps inc ratings issued by bond rating agencies are subject to change at any time

the company has entered into a letter of intent with pepsico  inc for the formation of a joint venture the jv that will be the exclusive bottler and distributor of pepsico beverages in a large portion of eastern russia  kyrgyzstan and kazakhstan 
the company has agreed to invest approximately  in the jv  for which it will receive a economic interest 
it is currently anticipated that the joint venture agreement will be executed during the second quarter of the company s investments in russia and argentina are subject to foreign exchange and other risks 
investing in the emerging markets of russia is subject to political risk and uncertainty concerning the government s ability to succeed in its program to convert to a market economy  both of which are beyond the company s control 
in argentina  the company s investment is subject to the foreign currency exchange risk of a devaluation of the argentine peso against the united states dollar  which the argentine government has indicated is not being considered  the volatility of the argentine banking system  the overall health of the argentine economy and the usual competitive factors experienced by insurance companies 
the source of the funds for the investments described above is general corporate funds available to the parent company 
effective as of december   control of the wmac companies was returned to the company and such subsidiaries were consolidated 
as a result  the company recorded a gain of  representing the difference between the carrying amount of the company s investment prior to consolidation and the net assets of such subsidiaries 
the investment portfolios of the company s insurance subsidiaries are principally fixed maturity investments rated investment grade or us governmental agency issued or guaranteed obligations  although limited investments in non rated or rated less than investment grade securities have been made from time to time 
the investment strategy of the insurance subsidiaries has been to maintain a high quality portfolio of publicly traded  fixed income securities with a relatively short duration 
principally as a result of decreases in market interest rates during  the unrealized loss on investments at the end of of approximately  net of taxes became an unrealized gain of approximately  net of taxes as of december  while this has resulted in an increase in shareholders equity  it had no effect on results of operations or cash flows 
as a result of significant losses from natural disasters suffered by the property and casualty insurance industry in recent years  the company has seen a notable decrease in the availability of reinsurance at reasonable rates  particularly at low levels of deductibility 
the company s insurance subsidiaries also suffered certain of such losses  although catastrophe reinsurance programs substantially reduced the economic losses in as a result of increased reinsurance rates  in the company raised its retention of lower level losses from  to  the company has benefited from a modest decline in reinsurance rates for its catastrophe reinsurance program and has not adjusted its retention of lower level losses 
in december  the company entered into an agreement with the california department of insurance to settle its proposition liability for  the settlement did not exceed reserves established in prior years 
the company paid the settlement amount during the first quarter of the company provides collateralized automobile loans to individuals with poor credit histories 
in  primarily as a result of increased competition together with the company s unwillingness to lower its underwriting standards and interest rate charges  the loan portfolio did not grow at the rate previously experienced 
additionally  loan losses have increased but remain less than the reserve maintained on this portfolio 
the company expects that the increased level of competition will continue  and  together with the company s unwillingness to lower rates  is likely to result in a contraction in the size of this portfolio in the future 
the company s investment in these loans was   and  at december   and  respectively 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries  including phlcorp and its subsidiaries  have substantial loss carryforwards and other tax attributes as more fully discussed in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amount and availability of tax loss carryforwards are subject to certain qualifications  limitations and uncertainties  including  with respect to phlcorp and its subsidiaries  tax sharing payments pursuant to a tax settlement agreement with the internal revenue service and the department of justice 
in order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of these carryforwards  the company s certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from accumulating at least five percent of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning at least five percent of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares 
the company has recognized as an asset net of reserves certain of the benefits of such loss carryforwards and other tax attributes 
however  the amount of the asset recognized only reflects the minimum phlcorp tax loss carryforwards and is based  in part  on certain proposed regulations affecting the use of phlcorp s tax loss carryforwards 
as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  significant additional amounts may be available under certain circumstances 
results of operations the company s most significant operations are its insurance businesses  where it is a specialty markets provider of property and casualty and life insurance to its niche markets 
for the year ended december   the company s insurance segments contributed of total revenues and  at december   constituted of total assets 
earned premium revenues and commissions of the property and casualty insurance operations of the empire group were  in   in and  in the increase in principally was attributable to growth in policies in force and increased premium rates  while the increase in resulted from increased policies in force 
the majority of the growth in each of and resulted from acquired blocks of assigned risk business from other insurance companies 
earned premium revenues of the colonial penn p c group were approximately  in   in and  in the growth in earned premiums in principally resulted from acquired blocks of assigned risk automobile business from other insurance companies and a modest increase in earned premiums related to voluntary automobile policies 
voluntary automobile policies in force at december  were almost greater than the prior year end  and written premiums increased from when the colonial penn p c group was acquired in  the company substantially reduced its existing marketing programs  which the company believes were not justified by prior operating results  and instituted new low cost direct marketing methods 
prior to  this strategy resulted in declining polices in force and earned premiums  as new business was not sufficient to offset the normal attrition of existing business 
the company believes that new business generated in will continue to exceed lapsed business and the rate of growth in policies in force will also increase  although there can be no assurance that this will be achieved 
earned premiums in also reflect an increase  as compared to the prior year  resulting from acquired blocks of automobile assigned risk business from other insurance companies 
the company s property and casualty insurance operations combined ratios as determined under gaap and sap were as follows year ended december  gaap sap the provision for insurance losses and policy benefits includes catastrophe losses  net of reinsurance recoveries  estimated at approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the losses include approximately  related to the northridge  california earthquake 
the increase in the combined ratios is primarily attributable to the empire group  which strengthened reserves in automobile and workers compensation lines by approximately  actuarial studies conducted during have identified revised loss development patterns in automobile lines  which may indicate greater ultimate loss experience than previously expected 
the empire group also reopened closed no fault claims files during and made additional payments on prior years claims 
this  along with changes in claim handling practices  have increased the difficultly of estimating ultimate losses  and actual losses may be different than the studies indicated 
however  the empire group strengthened reserves to the levels indicated in the actuarial studies 
the empire group will continue to analyze loss development patterns on a quarterly basis and will evaluate the adequacy of its loss reserves 
the combined ratios for the colonial penn p c group increased slightly in as compared to the combined ratios reflect higher losses related to acquired blocks of automobile assigned risk business that are partially offset by increased service fee income 
in addition  the combined ratios in were favorably affected by reduced catastrophe losses as compared to the combined ratios of the colonial penn p c group s core line of business  voluntary auto  were essentially unchanged 
the colonial penn p c group believes that its strong underwriting procedures  emphasis on mature adult insureds  prior rate increases and claims handling and settlement practices have enabled it to record combined ratios that compare favorably with the industry 
in addition to higher catastrophe losses  the combined ratios for increased as compared to principally due to settlements in of colonial penn p c group prior years claims at amounts less than provided 
premium revenue receipts on iop products of the life insurance subsidiaries which are not reflected as revenues were  in   in and  in the principal iop product sold during the three year period ended december  was a va product marketed directly to consumers 
the company believes the decline in premium revenue receipts of the va product is due to a combination of factors  including the public s perception of potential tax law changes  increased competition and the performance of the fund manager

insurance losses  policy benefits and amortization of deferred acquisition costs of the life and health insurance operations were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in reflects the run off of the agent sold medicare supplement business  which had less favorable loss experience in  reduced iop insurance in force and a  gain recognized from the termination of a reinsurance agreement 
the decrease in was partially offset by the growth of the graded benefit life product 
the decrease in as compared to the prior year primarily reflects the run off of the agent sold medicare supplement business and certain non recurring transactions in which are described below 
in  due to expectations of decreased or inadequate future profitability of its single premium whole life spwl products  the company reinsured its spwl business and recorded a net pre tax gain of approximately  such net pre tax gain consists of the premium received on the transaction of  which is reflected as a credit in the caption provision for insurance losses and policy benefits  and net security gains on investments sold in connection with the transaction of  reduced by the write off of deferred policy acquisition costs of  during  the company reinvested proceeds from sales of certain securities at the lower prevailing interest rates 
since these reinvestment rates were  in certain instances  lower than had previously been expected on certain fixed rate annuity policies  the company recorded an additional provision for insurance losses of manufacturing revenues decreased in principally due to reduced demand from customers of the bathroom vanities division and a factory fire at the fibers division  offset in part by increased sales at the plastics division

security gains in were realized  in part  to effect the reinsurance and transfer of the spwl business described above 
higher interest expense in each of and compared to the prior year principally reflects the increased level of outstanding debt 
interest expense also reflects the increased level of deposits at aib and aif and an increase in rates related to those deposits 
generally  interest rates on deposits are lower than on other available funds

during each of the last three years  statistical studies and estimates of service costs indicated that the recorded liability for unredeemed trading stamps was in excess of the amount that ultimately would be required to redeem trading stamps outstanding 
as a result  selling  general and other expenses applicable to the trading stamp operations include credits of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  reflecting adjustments made to the liability for unredeemed trading stamps 
the company s most recent analysis of the liability for unredeemed trading stamps has not identified any remaining excess as of december  the provision for income taxes for is below the expected normal corporate income tax rate principally due to the gain related to the return of the wmac companies  which is not taxable  and the favorable resolution of certain contingencies
