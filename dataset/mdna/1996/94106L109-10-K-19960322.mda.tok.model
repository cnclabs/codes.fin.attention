the following discussion includes statements that are forward looking in nature 
whether such statements ultimately prove to be accurate depends upon a variety of factors that may affect the business and operations of the company 
certain of these factors are discussed under business factors influencing future results and accuracy of foward looking information included in item of this report 
introduction the company provides non hazardous solid waste management services  consisting of collection  transfer  disposal  recycling  and other miscellaneous services in states 
since august  the company has experienced significant growth principally through the acquisition and integration of solid waste businesses and is now the fourth largest non hazardous solid waste company in north america 
the company owns or operates landfills  transfer stations  and collection companies serving more than  customers 
the company s revenues consist primarily of fees charged for its collection and disposal services 
revenues for collection services include fees from residential  commercial  industrial  and municipal collection customers 
a portion of these fees are billed in advance  a liability for future service is recorded upon receipt of payment and revenues are recognized as services are actually provided 
fees for residential services are normally based on the type and frequency of service 
fees for commercial and industrial services are normally based on the type and frequency of service and the volume of solid waste collected 
the company s revenues from its landfill operations consist of disposal fees known as tipping fees charged to third parties and are normally billed monthly 
tipping fees are based on the volume or weight of solid waste being disposed of at the company s landfill sites 
fees are charged at transfer stations based on the volume or weight of solid waste deposited  taking into account the company s cost of loading  transporting  and disposing of the solid waste at a landfill 
intercompany revenues between the company s landfill  transfer  and collection operations have been eliminated in the financial statements presented herein 
operating expenses include direct and indirect labor and the related taxes and benefits  fuel  maintenance and repairs of equipment and facilities  tipping fees paid to third party landfills  property taxes  and accruals for future landfill closure and post closure costs 
certain direct landfill development expenses are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful life of a site as capacity is consumed  and include acquisition  engineering  upgrading  construction  and permitting costs 
all indirect development expenses  such as administrative salaries and general corporate overhead  are expensed in the period incurred 
general and administrative costs include management salaries  clerical  and administrative costs  professional services  facility rentals  and related insurance costs  as well as costs related to the company s marketing and sales force

acquisitions during and accounted for increases of  and  respectively  in operating revenues  while dispositions in and accounted for decreases of  and  respectively  in operating revenues compared to the respective prior years 
operating revenues from comparable operations were most significantly effected by certain businesses in new jersey 
operating revenues in new jersey were negatively impacted as a result of contract renegotiations and terminations in and in december  chambers entered into a new three year agreement at a rate reduced from its existing contract for the municipal solid waste from bergen county  new jersey  effective march a contract for the transportation and disposal of ash generated by a local incinerator was lost in march another local solid waste contract for a local county expired in december  and still another local county began redirecting waste to a competitor s landfill  commencing december  on december   chambers sold two transfer stations in morris county  new jersey  to the morris county municipal utilities authority 
chambers agreed to operate the transfer stations and provide certain transportation services at a reduced rate until the county s long term solid waste system is in operation  or until december   if later 
morris county assumed operations of the transfer stations on january   but chambers continued providing transportation services 
therefore  in  operating revenues do not include the pass through of disposal and other costs necessary to operate the transfer stations 
morris county has an option to extend the transportation agreement for two six month periods beyond  if its solid waste system is not operational 
the operating revenues for the two transfer stations have declined from approximately  in to  in  to approximately  in the combined negative impact of these contract renegotiations and terminations was a decrease of operating revenues of  from to and  from to it is expected that the operating revenues for these new jersey businesses will not be significantly different in as compared to  provided that morris county s solid waste system is not yet operational 
the components of the change in operating revenues are as follows vs 
vs 
price volume acquisitions  net of dispositions certain new jersey businesses total change operating costs and expenses operating costs and expenses decreased  or  in as compared to  and increased  in  or  as compared to the decrease in operating costs and expenses in is attributable to a  decrease due to the increased utilization of internal disposal capacity and reduced operating costs and expenses for the chambers operations of approximately  since the chambers merger excluding reduction in costs in new jersey of approximately 
these decreases are offset by increased operating costs and expenses as a result of new acquisitions  net of dispositions 
the impact of acquisitions also explains the increase in operating costs and expenses in new business acquisitions resulted in an increase in operating costs and expenses of  in and  in while dispositions resulted in a decrease of  in and  in operating costs and expenses for comparable operations accounted for the remainder of the increase of  as a percentage of operating revenues  operating costs and expenses increased from in to in and decreased to in the emphasis in internalization and operating efficiency improvements at the chambers existing operations after the chambers merger in contributes to the decrease in operating costs as a percent of operating revenues 
another factor affecting the percent of operating costs and expenses as a percentage of operating revenues is the strategic business decisions to exit or reduce operations in certain markets in where margins were not as high  thereby improving the relationship between operating costs and revenues 
for example  in september  the company determined that it would exit the market in phoenix  arizona  which resulted in the reduction of operating costs and decreased the percentage of operating costs as compared to operating revenues in  as compared to another factor affecting the relationship of operating costs and expenses as a percentage of operating revenues is the company s percentage of operating revenues generated by type of service 
the company s operating revenues from disposal operations decreased from in to in and then increased to in this affects the relationship between operating costs and expenses and operating revenues since disposal operations generally have lower cost margins than collection and transfer station operations 
harsh weather conditions in the first quarter of adversely affected operating costs in certain markets 
in the second quarter of  the company experienced higher operating costs in two of its larger collection operations due to higher labor costs and certain variable expenses  which were not offset by a corresponding increase in operating revenues 
in addition  certain businesses acquired in late had relatively higher operating costs as operational cost improvements had not yet been fully implemented by the company 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased  in  as compared to  and increased  in as compared to the decrease in is the result of the company s ability to integrate operating revenues from acquisitions without a proportionate increase in general and administrative expenses and cost reductions in connection with the chambers merger 
in  general and administrative expenses increased due to business acquisitions which accounted for an increase of  and by accrued contributions of  in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses as percentage of operating revenues decreased from in to in and to in this decrease has been as a result of the company s ability to integrate new operating revenues without a corresponding increase in general and administrative costs and cost savings resulting from mergers completed in chambers and envirofil  inc 
merger costs in  the company incurred approximately  in merger costs in the second quarter related to the chambers merger  which included  of transaction costs   of severance and other termination benefits  and  of costs related to integrating operations 
in  the company incurred  of merger costs in the second quarter related to the acquisition of envirofil  inc unusual items in  the unusual items include  of severance and other termination benefits paid to former chambers employees in connection with its pre merger reorganization   of estimated future losses associated with the renegotiated bergen county  new jersey  municipal solid waste contract  and  of shareholder litigation settlement costs 
in  unusual items consisted of  for asset impairments and abandoned projects  including a  charge to reduce the carrying value of the chambers medical and special waste incinerator facility  and restructuring costs of  relating to severance benefits 
unusual items of  in consists of  for asset impairments and abandoned projects   for net losses on asset divesture and contractual commitments   for special directors and officers insurance premiums   for stock compensation expense   for restructuring costs relating to severance benefits  and a  credit for net gains on asset divestitures 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased  in and  in as compared to the prior years 
in  depreciation and amortization decreased due to the change in the estimated useful life of excess cost over net assets of acquired businesses related to certain acquisitions from to years  effective january   which resulted in decreased amortization expense of approximately  for the year 
this change in accounting policy substantially offset the normal increase in depreciation and amortization of property and equipment used to generate increased operating revenues 
in  the increase is primarily due to new acquisitions 
depreciation and amortization  however  decreased as a percentage of operating revenues from in to in and to in the decrease as a percent of operating revenues in was due to the change in life used to amortize the excess of cost over net assets of acquired businesses from to years and the result of a reduction in the estimates of costs to be incurred to complete construction of certain landfills 
in  the decrease is due to the impact of increased airspace projections resulting from future expansions of existing landfill sites 
income from operations income from operations increased  in and decreased  in as compared to their respective prior years due to the reasons discussed above 
in and  the company incurred certain nonrecurring items reported as unusual items and merger costs 
excluding these nonrecurring items  income from operations as a percentage of revenues would be   and for   and  respectively 
the improvement in recurring operations in is the result of economies of scale realized by the company with respect to recent acquisitions  improved operating margins at chambers locations since the chambers merger  the change in useful life of excess cost over net assets of acquired businesses  dispositions of less profitable businesses  and improvements in comparative operations 
other income and expense other income and expense consists of shareholder litigation settlement  interest expense  interest income  and other income 
shareholder litigation settlement costs were incurred in connection with a settled class action of consolidated suits or similar claims alleging federal securities violations against chambers  certain of its officers and directors  its former auditors and the underwriters of its securities 
interest expense consists of recurring and nonrecurring interest 
nonrecurring interest of  and  in and  respectively consists of various extension fees and other charges related to refinancing the senior notes in the second quarter of overall  recurring interest expense  gross of amounts capitalized  decreased slightly each year due to reductions in the average effective borrowing rate on the company s outstanding debt 
capitalized interest for approximated  compared to  and  for and  respectively  due to increased development activity incurred in connection with disposal sites 
the increase in other income in is primarily a result of the sale of real estate in phoenix  arizona  during the first quarter of provision for benefit from income taxes the company recorded an income tax benefit of  in compared to an income tax provision of  and  in and  respectively 
future taxable income was projected utilizing taxable income of and annualized earnings from acquisitions consummated during based on this analysis of taxable income  the company  during the fourth quarter of  recognized a net deferred tax asset through a  reduction in the valuation allowance 
the deferred tax asset is reflected as a current asset on the company s balance sheet at december  if the company s current trend of profitability continues  additional net deferred tax assets of up to approximately  could be recognized in future periods 
net income loss for the reasons discussed above  net income loss improved  for the year ended december  as compared to and decreased  for the year ended december  as compared to variation in quarterly net income loss the company s operating results during reflect significant quarterly variations in net income loss as reflected below see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information quarter net income loss in thousands first second  third  fourth  the company consummated the chambers merger on june   restating its first quarter financial results in accordance with pooling of interests accounting and reflecting combined operations with chambers for the second quarter of prior to the merger  chambers was involved in extensive litigation  had a high level of debt and had been experiencing operating losses 
as a result of these losses  chambers had generated a tax net operating loss carryforward in excess of  at the date of the merger 
as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements  chambers net loss of approximately  in the first quarter of had a significant impact on the restated first quarter results of the combined entities 
the net loss of approximately  reported by the company in the second quarter of principally results from the chambers merger costs of approximately  recognized in the quarter and other unusual charges and nonrecurring interest costs relating to chambers which were also charged to expense during the quarter 
included in the second quarter merger costs and unusual charges were  and  of severance and other termination benefits costs  respectively 
the annualized salary and benefits expense eliminated as a result of these terminations is estimated to be  following the chambers merger  the company initiated a comprehensive plan to improve the operating results of the acquired chambers businesses 
in addition to the terminations discussed above  this plan included closing the chambers corporate headquarters  adding managers with significant industry experience  aggressively marketing additional volumes to the chambers landfill sites  refinancing chambers indebtedness at lower borrowing costs  combining the companies insurance and bonding programs for additional cost savings  and implementing operational changes and tightening financial controls to improve margins at the chambers field operations 
the company began to realize the benefits of these post merger actions in the third quarter 
these factors  combined with a series of acquisitions consummated in the third quarter and the utilization of a portion of chambers net operating loss carryforwards  contributed to the company reporting net income of  for the third quarter 
the company continued its integration of the chambers assets in the fourth quarter  again focusing on improving margins at the field locations 
in addition  volumes at the company s landfills continued to increase in the fourth quarter 
the company also consummated an additional acquisition during the quarter and recognized the benefit of a full quarter of operations of the acquisitions closed during the third quarter of the company continued a strategy commenced during the third quarter in which a larger percentage of waste collected by the company was deposited in the company s own landfills  thereby reducing third party landfill costs and enhancing margins as a percentage of revenues 
moreover  the company s interest costs declined approximately  in the fourth quarter as the company reduced indebtedness through the successful completion of an equity offering and the conversion to equity of the company s subordinated debentures 
furthermore  with the company s profitability improving and based upon an analysis of future taxable income  the company recognized the benefit of a deferred tax asset in the amount of  during the fourth quarter  significantly increasing fourth quarter net income to approximately  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
although the company s profits in the third and fourth quarter of showed marked improvements over the earlier quarters  there can be no assurance that this trend will continue 
furthermore  the company s anticipated western merger will result in additional restatements of previously published financial results and merger costs which the company currently estimates at  will be expensed in the period the western merger is completed 
actual merger costs may vary from such estimate 
in addition  the company s operations in the first quarter of have been impacted detrimentally by the harsh winter weather 
as a result  future results could reflect significant variations in quarterly earnings 
liquidity and capital resources the company operates in an industry that requires a high level of capital investment 
the company s capital requirements basically stem from i its working capital needs for its ongoing operations  ii capital expenditures for cell construction and expansion of its landfill sites  as well as new trucks and equipment for its collection and hauling operations  and iii business acquisitions 
the company s strategy is to meet these capital needs first from internally generated funds and secondly from various financing sources available to the company  including the issuance of its common stock 
it is further part of the company s strategy to minimize working capital while maintaining available commitments under bank credit agreements to fund any working capital needs in excess of internally generated cash flow 
at december   the company s working capital was  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was which compares to a working capital deficit of  the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december  working capital was affected by a increase in accounts receivable  which consists of a increase due to receivables acquired in business combinations  a increase due to the increase in operating revenues  excluding certain new jersey businesses  and a decrease related to these new jersey businesses 
the consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the chambers merger which was consummated june   and accounted for as a pooling of interests 
prior to the chambers merger  chambers had limited access to capital and maintained a high level of debt  and was working under an intercreditor agreement with its various lenders 
at the time of the chambers merger  the company entered into a new  bank credit facility with a consortium of banks and significantly refinanced chambers indebtedness  funded certain required litigation settlement payments related to chambers  paid certain costs related to the chambers merger and provided the company with committed but unused funds of  for general corporate purposes  including acquisitions 
at june   the company was highly leveraged  with indebtedness for borrowed money representing almost of the company s total capitalization with total capitalization being equal to indebtedness for borrowed money plus stockholders equity 
subsequent to that date  the company proceeded with a strategy to reduce its indebtedness  increase its stockholders equity  strengthen its balance sheet and improve its credit profile 
in october  the company completed the sale of  shares of its common stock  raising approximately  net of expenses 
the proceeds were used to reduce indebtedness  seventy five percent of which remains available to redraw for future use under the company s bank credit facility 
between november  and december   the company also consummated the conversion of  of convertible subordinated debentures debentures into its common stock  issuing approximately  shares in retirement of the debentures 
earlier in   of debentures  had been converted into approximately  shares of company common stock 
moreover  the company increased its stockholders equity by using approximately  of equity in business acquisitions during the second half of  and added almost  of equity through second half earnings 
the company reported a net loss for the first six months of of about  principally as a result of merger costs and other unusual charges relating to chambers 
as a result of these activities  the company has increased its stockholders equity from  at december  approximately  at june  to  at december  at the same time the company has reduced its indebtedness for borrowed money including shareholder litigation indebtedness from  at december  approximately  at june  to  at december  consequently  the company has significantly reduced its percentage of indebtedness for borrowed money to total capitalization from at december  approximately at june  to at december  moreover  at december   the company had  in cash and cash equivalents and approximately  available for loans under its bank credit facility expanded to  subsequent to december  
in december  the company announced that it had entered into an agreement to merge with western  another publicly held solid waste management company 
subject to shareholder approval  the company expects that the western merger will be consummated by april  the company believes that the western merger will further strengthen the company s balance sheet  cash flow and credit profile 
as a result of the pending western merger  improved company profitability and strengthened balance sheet  standard poor s recently increased the company s credit rating from bb to bbb investment grade 
the company believes that the improved credit rating will benefit it in future financing arrangements 
the company is currently negotiating with its banks to provide a new credit facility or amendment to its existing facility to be effective at or near the date of the western merger 
the company believes this new facility will be structured as a million revolving credit facility  will be unsecured  will have a term of five years  and will be priced commensurate with the company s improved credit profile and credit rating 
the company anticipates its capital expenditures for will be approximately  which the company intends to fund through its internally generated cash flow and available bank credit facility 
almost of the capital expenditure budget is planned to be spent in the company s landfill operations for cell construction and certain expansion operations at the company s landfill sites 
slightly less than of the capital expenditure budget is allocated to the company s waste collection and hauling operations  with the balance predominantly allocated to the company s transfer station operations 
the company has also recently announced its intention to enter the new york city solid waste market with the potential acquisition of an existing group of businesses 
if consummated  the company would have a cash obligation of approximately  at closing with contingent consideration payable in the future depending upon the actual performance of the businesses acquired for up to five years after closing 
the transaction is subject to certain required approvals and permit issues which make the timing and ultimate consummation of the transaction uncertain at this time 
although the company remains optimistic  there can be no assurance that the company will obtain all the required approvals and permits necessary for it to consummate the proposed transaction 
part of the company s business strategy is to grow through acquisitions 
the company has been  and expects to continue to be  an active participant in the consolidation trend ongoing within the industry 
the company has issued equity securities in business acquisitions where appropriate  and expects to do so in the future 
furthermore  the company s future growth will depend upon its ability to raise additional capital 
management believes that it can arrange the necessary financing required to accomplish its business plan  however  to the extent the company is not successful in its future financing strategies  the company s growth could be limited 
the company regularly engages in discussions relating to potential acquisitions and has identified several possible acquisition opportunities and may announce additional acquisition transactions at any time 
environmental matters the company also has material financial commitments for the costs associated with its future closure and post closure obligations with respect to the landfills it operates or for which it is otherwise responsible 
the company bases accruals for these commitments on periodic management reviews  performed at least annually  based on input from its engineers and interpretations of current regulatory requirements and proposed regulatory changes 
the accrual for closure and post closure costs includes final capping and cover for the site  methane gas control  leachate management and ground water monitoring  and other operational and maintenance costs to be incurred after each site stops accepting waste 
the company has estimated that the aggregate final closure and post closure costs will be approximately  as of december  and  the company had recorded liabilities of  and  respectively  for closure and post closure costs of disposal facilities 
the difference between the closure and post closure costs accrued at december   and the total estimated final closure and post closure costs to be incurred will be accrued and charged to expense as airspace is consumed such that the total estimated final closure and post closure costs to be incurred will be fully accrued for each landfill at the time the site stops accepting waste and is closed 
the company also expects to incur approximately  related to capping activities expected to occur during the operating lives of the disposal sites  which are also being expensed over the useful lives of the disposal sites as airspace is consumed 
management believes that the ultimate disposition of these environmental matters will not have a material  adverse effect on the financial condition of the company 
however  the company s operation of landfills subjects it to certain operational  monitoring  site maintenance  closure and post closure obligations that could give rise to increased costs for monitoring and corrective measures 
the company cannot predict the effect of any regulations or legislation enacted in the future on the company s operations 
seasonality and inflation because the volumes of certain types of waste  such as yard clippings and construction debris  tend to be higher in the spring and summer  the company experiences seasonal variations in its revenues 
as a result  during spring and summer  the company s revenues tend to be higher than its revenues in fall and winter 
in addition  during the winter  harsh weather conditions often temporarily affect the company s ability to collect  transport  and dispose of waste 
the seasonal impact is often offset by revenues added through acquisitions such that the company s reported revenues have historically reflected increases in period to period comparisons 
the company believes that inflation and changing prices have not had  and are not expected to have  any material adverse effect on the results of operations in the near future
