the matchbox net operating losses are subject to an annual limitation and can only be used to offset taxable income of the matchbox domestic companies 
these net operating losses expire during the years through the reconciliation of the company s loss before taxes for financial statement purposes to domestic taxable loss for the three years ended december  is as follows in thousands loss before taxes    differences between loss before taxes for financial statement purposes and taxable loss permanent differences    loss from subsidiaries not included in the consolidated tax return    net change in temporary differences    stock option deductions  taxable loss    under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  the company is required to record a net deferred tax asset for the future tax benefits of tax loss and tax credit carryforwards  as well as for other temporary differences  if realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
based on the weight of available evidence  management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the company s future taxable income by taxing jurisdiction will be sufficient in the carryforward period to realize a tax benefit on certain of its temporary differences 
accordingly  the company has recorded a benefit on that portion of its temporary differences  including net operating loss carryforwards which will more likely than not be realized prior to their expiration dates 
management believes that the company s future taxable income will be at a level sufficient to fully utilize the   and domestic net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences 
annual domestic pre tax income as adjusted for changes in temporary differences  certain permanent items  nonrecurring charges and other appropriate adjustments for the four year period ending december  averaged approximately  this level of domestic taxable income  if earned each year over the carryforward period  would not be sufficient to realize approximately  of the tax benefits represented by the net domestic net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and other temporary differences prior to their expiration 
sfas includes the consideration of tax planning strategies in the determination of the amount of valuation allowance needed 
through the use of an appropriate tax planning strategy  which management would implement to prevent the expiration of tax benefits  an additional  of annual domestic taxable income would be realized 
this additional taxable income  when added to the above average income  would be sufficient to fully realize the tax benefits represented by the net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences prior to their expiration 
if no tax planning strategies were implemented  adjusted average annual domestic pre tax income would have to grow at an average annual compound rate of in order to fully realize the tax benefits prior to their expiration 
management believes that taxable income over a four year period represents the cyclical pattern of the company s core business 
the company s core business includes product lines with lives exceeding three years 
these core products appear in the company s product line from year to year in their base form with some modifications 
during  sales of core products approximated of sales 
based on the company s core product line and expanded non core or promotional product line  as well as the company s prior history of earnings  management anticipates that the company will be able to return to profitability 
management believes that the company s domestic subsidiaries royalty arrangements with its international subsidiaries will contribute to future domestic profitability 
while management expects the company to return to profitability  future levels of operating income are dependent upon general economic conditions  including competitive pressures on sales and profit margins  and other factors beyond the company s control 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that sufficient taxable income will be generated to allow full utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards and other temporary differences 
management has considered these factors in reaching its conclusion that it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be sufficient to utilize certain net operating loss carryforwards and other temporary differences prior to their expiration 
valuation allowances totalling  have been established due to management s analysis indicating that certain tax credit and net operating loss carryforwards  the use and life of which are limited under the income tax laws  may expire prior to their full utilization 
the valuation allowances include  related to the preacquisition net operating losses of matchbox 
any subsequently recognized benefits related to these net operating losses will be allocated to reduce goodwill
