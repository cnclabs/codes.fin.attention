item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net sales registrant s net sales of contact laser tm systems are primarily comprised of nd yag laser systems and contact laser delivery systems and related accessories 
for the three years presented above  the u 
s market was serviced predominantly by a direct sales force  while sales outside the united states were derived through a network of distributors 
in  net sales were million  a million  or  decrease from sales of million 
net sales of nd yag laser systems in decreased by on a decline in units 
the decrease was mainly caused by the introduction in late of an electrosurgical rollerball type product which competed with registrant in the urology market in  negatively impacting the sales of nd yag laser systems in the united states  as well as in international markets 
in addition to the impact specifically on the urology market  capital purchases by hospitals continued to be generally weak  affecting particularly the us and european hospital markets 
two other factors were also operative 
first  sales to c 
r 
bard in  for which there were no corresponding sales in  accounted for of the decrease 
second  lower sales to mediq prn slt  registrant s joint venture rental company  accounted for of the decrease 
during  average unit prices were and lower than average unit prices in the international and domestic markets  respectively 
net sales of nd yag laser units in increased by on a increase in units over international expansion  excluding sales to c 
r 
bard  accounted for a significant portion of the growth in net sales of nd yag laser systems  increasing by  while domestic net sales of nd yag laser systems grew  partially as a result of sales to mediq prn slt 
sales to c 
r 
bard in were approximately the same as in during  average unit prices in both the international and domestic markets were consistent with the average unit price for each market in the greater percentage increase in unit sales relative to net sales resulted from a greater percentage increase in sales in the international markets than in the domestic market 
net sales of contact laser delivery systems and related accessories decreased in due mainly to competition within the urology market 
in  net sales of contact laser delivery systems increased primarily from growth in the urology market and from sales to mediq prn slt 
management believes that the general market conditions that were experienced over the three years presented will likely not improve during to bring its expenditures in line with its revevues  registrant effected a signficant reduction in its workforce in july see item a  general development of business and the section below operating expenses 
registrant has also been seeking a sub tenant for its office and research training facility see item  properties 
in response to the negative market conditions  management has invested and will continue to invest in innovative product development and will continue to develop and expand its strategic business relationships while actively pursuing business combination or acquisition opportunities aimed at enhancing the generation of new revenues 
in  slt will continue to expand its cooperative efforts with tenet healthcare in the specialty areas of urology  sinus surgery and thoracic surgery 
in addition  management expects that the recently introduced vapormax urologic probe will enhance slt s competitive position in the urologic surgery market 
further  to offset the constraints in selling capital equipment  slt had introduced its select line of products  equipped with an sma connector  which makes certain products from slt s proprietary line of contact laser delivery systems available to be used on other manufacturers laser systems 
the initial products made available with this connector were slt s versatile line of urologic products  and expansion into other proprietary multi specialty products will be made during gross profit gross profit for the year ended december  decreased million or from the prior year on a decrease in net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was  down from in the decrease is attributable to higher fixed manufacturing costs per unit due to the lower volume of net sales 
gross profit for the year ended january  increased million or from the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit was  up from in the fiscal year 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increases in volume and lower costs associated with the self manufacture of both nd yag laser systems and contact laser delivery systems  partially offset by a shift in market mix in favor of international sales 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in  a decrease of 
at the end of the second quarter of  slt implemented a reduction in workforce to bring its employment levels in line with the requirements needed to support its actual sales levels 
employment reductions totaled and were made in most functional areas 
following the cost reduction measures  selling  general and administrative expenses were million in the second half of versus million in the first half of  an annualized million reduction 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of from the level of million 
product development product development costs were million in both and slt continues to focus its product development activities on developing next generation lasers and on expanding the utility of its laser systems through the development of innovative laser delivery systems for use in various surgical specialties in which lasers have a distinct advantage and are cost effective 
non recurring charges credits in  slt recorded non recurring charges of  representing fourth quarter charges of  for the write down of certain sharpened fiber inventories   for the write off of certain intangible assets acquired in the technology acquisition from alst  and a second quarter charge of  for severance and other costs incurred in connection with a workforce reduction 
in  slt recorded a benefit of  representing the settlement of a lawsuit with alst  partially offset by a separate legal settlement with a former distributor 
the net benefit is reflected in the statement of operations as a credit of  included in operating expenses and interest expense of  in  slt recorded a non recurring charge of  to increase the consolidation and relocation reserve established for the relocation of its manufacturing facilities from kentucky to pennsylvania 
net litigation settlement in december  slt received  in cash in settlement for damages relating to the patent infringement suit which slt had brought against sharplan lasers  inc in may  and later against its parent company  laser industries ltd 
see item  legal proceedings 
netted against the gain from the settlement was the write off of  for previously capitalized patent litigation costs see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest net interest expense of  decreased by  from  in the decrease was due primarily to reduced interest expense on long term debt and to higher interest income due to the higher level of cash and cash equivalents 
net interest expense in of  decreased by  from  in this resulted from a reduction of interest expense due to the conversion of a portion of the convertible subordinated notes that were issued in connection with the settlement of the stockholders litigation see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  and reduced interest expense on long term debt  offset in part by interest expense incurred in settlement of litigation with a former distributor 
additionally  interest income increased due to higher levels of cash and cash equivalents 
income taxes the tax provision of  in was for federal alternative minimum and state income taxes  the provision in of  was for state income taxes 
there was no provision for income taxes in due to the net taxable loss incurred 
slt expects that its effective tax rate for will remain significantly lower than the statutory rate  due to continued availability of its net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at december  were million  an increase of million over the january  balance of million 
in each of the two years   was restricted and pledged in favor of american united life insurance company aulic as a condition of the first mortgage with aulic see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december  and january   letters of credit  issued under registrant s bank line of credit  were outstanding in favor of the montgomery county industrial development corporation mcidc as a condition of the mortgage and security agreement with mcidc see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the letters of credit amounted to  and  at the end of and  respectively 
the letter of credit requirement extends until registrant records four consecutive quarters of profitability in a given calendar year 
in addition  registrant has a million credit facility with a bank 
this facility includes a sub line for letters of credit of  under which the aforementioned letters of credit were issued 
other than the letter of credit requirement  and one other minor trade letter of credit  there were no borrowings outstanding under the line of credit 
borrowings under the line are secured by registrant s accounts receivable and inventories and were subject to a borrowing base calculation at december  which was eliminated subsequent to the end of the line is subject to registrant maintaining certain financial covenants as defined 
this line of credit facility expires on june  net cash provided from operating activities was million in  compared to million in this increase was due mainly to the net gain from the patent litigation settlement offset in part by the net loss incurred in before non recurring charges  compared to a net profit of million before non recurring credits in of the million received in the settlement  million was used to pay legal fees that had been deferred pending this settlement 
net cash used in investing activities increased million in to million from million in the increase was due primarily to the purchase in of short term investments 
capital expenditures in of approximately  are anticipated  mainly for manufacturing and research and development purposes 
registrant  however  is not contractually committed to spend any of this amount 
in and  registrant invested  and  respectively in its patents  primarily in defense costs 
due to the settlement of its litigation with sharplan lasers  inc  and its parent laser industries ltd  additional investment in defense of registrant s patents relative to this suit will not be incurred in net cash used in financing activities was  in  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of  in the decrease in cash provided by financing activities is due primarily to the net proceeds from an investment agreement which registrant entered into with kontron instruments holding nv kontron instruments under the terms of which kontron instruments made a million equity investment  representing a ownership position in registrant 
management believes that registrant s current cash position and line of credit availability will be sufficient to meet its commitments for long term debt see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  other commitments and contingencies see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and capital expenditures 
management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on operations
