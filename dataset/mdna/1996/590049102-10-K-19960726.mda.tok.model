the company expects that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial majority of its sales and that the relative dollar amount and mix of product sold to any of these customers can change significantly from year to year 
there can be no assurance that the company s principal customers will continue to purchase products and services from the company at current levels  or that the mix of products purchased will be in the same ratio

net sales 
the company is engaged in the single business segment of producing custom  complex  technologically advanced printed circuit boards to customer specifications 
accordingly  the company does not disclose separately the sales or results of operations of the forest grove  loveland or soladyne operations 
the company classifies its products  principally based on the type of production materials used  as rigid  high performance  and flexible printed circuit boards 
net sales for fiscal year were  representing a increase over prior year net sales of  the overall increase in net sales resulted principally from the acquisition of the loveland and soladyne operations  from increased sales of high performance products which increased by  or as compared to sales of high performance products in  and from capacity and productivity increases to meet customer demand at the forest grove facility 
the company  along with many of its competitors  is experiencing lower demand that the company believes will result in lower sales and net income in the first half of fiscal year two of the company s largest customers have recently issued press releases indicating that they are also experiencing a softness in demand 
this could result in a reduction in sales orders from these customers which could have a material adverse effect on the company s sales and earnings 
the interconnect industry has added production capacity within the last year which  together with the current reduced demand  could intensify price competition that could also negatively impact sales and earnings 
additionally  the company closed all of its facilities the week of july  for the purpose of completing capital equipment installations and major facilities maintenance projects 
although there can be no assurances that they will be effective  the company is taking actions to mitigate the effect of these conditions  including the qualification of new customers to broaden the company s customer base 
based on comments from several customers  the company believes that industry conditions should improve and customers inventory adjustments should be worked through by the end of calendar however  there can be no assurance that this will occur 
new product development 
the company continues to invest in new product research and development as technology leadership will become increasingly important to the interconnect industry 
in december  the company entered into a sub license agreement with hp s printed circuit organization under which the company has the rights to use the dycostratetm interconnect substrate technology 
the company believes that the dycostratetm technology will offer customers a better price performance ratio in high volume applications than traditional technologies

the company s product mix in fiscal year included a higher percentage of rigid product due to the acquisition of the loveland operation which produces exclusively rigid product 
the company performs component subassembly on certain of its high performance products as a customer accommodation 
such subassembly services carry substantially lower gross margins than circuit board production 
gross margins decreased in fiscal year principally as a result of product mix  including the effect of the loveland operation  and an increase in sales of products that include component subassembly 
prior to its acquisition by the company  the loveland operation generated relatively low margins due to its captive status 
the company is investing in productivity and capacity improvements in order to improve these margins 
however  there are no assurances that these margins will be higher in the future 
while the exact impact is not known at this time  the company expects that lower sales in the first half of fiscal year will result in a lower gross margin for this period
