item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview apache s results of operations and financial position during were significantly impacted by the following factors property acquisitions acquisitions continued to be a significant part of apache s growth strategy in  with the company adding over mmboe of proved reserves during the year through purchases 
led by the addition of interests from texaco exploration and production inc texaco and aquila energy resources corporation aquila  apache spent million on the acquisition of oil and gas properties during acquisitions were a major force behind apache posting its th consecutive year of production growth and record year end reserves of mmboe 
the texaco and aquila properties  combined with properties acquired from crystal oil company crystal in late  boosted apache s production by nearly mmcf d of natural gas and mb d of oil 
dekalb merger on may   apache acquired dekalb energy company dekalb  now known as dek energy company through a merger which resulted in dekalb becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of apache 
pursuant to the merger agreement  apache issued million shares of its common stock in exchange for outstanding dekalb stock and dekalb employee stock options that remained outstanding at the time of the merger 
the merger was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
as a result  apache s financial information for all preceding periods and the following management discussion have been prepared on a combined basis using the pooling of interests method of accounting 
apache s earnings for were reduced by a non recurring pre tax charge of approximately million for investment banking fees  severance payments and other costs associated with the merger 
the merger costs  which are largely non deductible for income tax purposes  reduced apache s net income by million  or 
per share 
commodity prices during  natural gas spot prices remained volatile  fluctuating from a low of per mcf in july to a high of per mcf in december 
domestic spot prices during the first eight months of lagged behind comparable prices in  then rebounded above levels during the last four months of the year 
as a result  apache s average gas price for was down percent from a year ago  negatively impacting earnings by approximately million 
a nine percent increase in the company s average oil price from offset nearly million of the impact of lower gas prices 
on an equivalent basis  prices negatively impacted earnings by 
per share 
hedging loss in december  apache recorded a pre tax hedging loss of million resulting from the decoupling of new york mercantile exchange nymex natural gas futures prices and actual cash prices received by producers for natural gas delivered throughout most of the united states 
the loss  which stems from contracts for january through march  deliveries  reduced apache s net income by million  or 
per share 
results of operations net income and revenue apache reported net income of million  or 
per share  compared with million  or 
per share in the decline was due to the lower natural gas realizations and the non recurring charges noted above 
absent one time charges for the merger costs and hedging loss  earnings would have totaled 
per share 
revenues for totaled million  an increase of percent from a year ago 
apache s oil and gas production revenues  boosted by record levels of oil and gas production and a per barrel increase in apache s average realized oil price  rose percent from a percent decline in the company s average realized gas price dampened further improvement in apache s oil and gas production revenues 
also during  apache more than doubled its gathering  processing and marketing revenues to million

natural gas sales contributed million to revenues  up five percent from as production gains from acquisitions and drilling more than offset the impact of a 
per mcf decline in the company s average realized gas price 
acquisitions boosted apache s gas production by approximately mmcf d  while drilling additions outpaced the impact of property divestitures and natural depletion 
apache realized production gains in each of its three operating areas  the united states  canada and australia 
in addition to production gains from drilling  the australian sales benefited from new markets for its natural gas 
the company s average realized natural gas price declined percent from  negatively impacting sales by approximately million 
reflecting an increase in both production and prices  oil sales jumped percent in to million 
apache s oil production rose mb d  or percent  from a year ago as property divestitures and natural depletion partially offset the mb d of production added through acquisitions 
the company s average realized oil price increased nine percent in to per barrel 
revenues from the sale of natural gas liquids totaled million in  up percent from a year ago due to higher prices and a slight increase in volumes 
gathering  processing and marketing revenues in more than doubled from a year ago to million 
the revenue increase primarily reflects additional volumes sold under crude oil and natural gas contracts  an activity that typically has low margins 
apache s gross margin from gathering  processing and marketing activities declined seven percent from a year ago due to the sale of the company s interest in the little knife gas plant as part of apache s divestiture of rocky mountain properties  reduced gathering volumes  and a lower per barrel crude oil margin resulting from a higher mix of low margin sour grade oil 
other revenues in of 
million reflects million of contract settlement income  million in gains from the sales of non oil and gas assets  million of canadian royalty credits and million of other income  offset by the million hedging loss from the decoupling of nymex and wellhead prices 
costs and expenses operating costs increased million  or percent  in due to the impact of apache s acquisitions 
based on an equivalent unit of production  operating costs increased 
per barrel to per barrel for the percent increase in unit cost reflects the high percentage of oil properties comprising the texaco acquisition  as oil properties typically have a higher per unit cost than gas properties 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a expense rose percent from a year ago due to the increase in oil and gas production 
on a per unit basis  dd a expense declined six percent to per boe 
apache s full cost amortization rates fell in the united states  canada and australia due to the favorable impact of reserve additions and revisions 
administrative  selling and other costs declined million  or six percent  in due primarily to the elimination of duplicate administrative functions following the merger of dekalb into apache 
apache integrated its acquisitions with minimal increases in administrative staff 
on an equivalent unit of production basis  administrative  selling and other costs declined percent from to 
per boe 
net financing costs of million were slightly more than double the amount due to increased debt levels from acquisitions and due to higher interest rates 
apache s average interest rate increased from percent in to percent in due to higher market rates and apache s higher debt to total capitalization rate following the acquisition of properties from texaco 
hedging activity the company periodically enters into hedging activities with respect to a portion of its projected oil and natural gas production through a variety of financial arrangements intended to support oil and natural gas prices at targeted levels and to minimize the impact of price fluctuations 
apache uses swaps  puts  collars and fixed price contracts to hedge its commodity prices 
as noted in the company s significant accounting policies  normal recurring gains or losses on these activities are recognized in oil and gas production revenues when the hedged volumes are produced 
in  apache recognized net recurring gains from hedging activities which boosted oil and gas production revenues by approximately million and million  respectively 
these gains increased the company s average realized oil and natural gas prices in by 
per barrel and 
per mcf  respectively 
also in  the company realized million of gains from hedging activities that relate to future production periods 
these gains will be recognized in oil and gas production revenues over periods ranging from one to months based on physical production 
during the fourth quarter of  apache entered into swap agreements for january  february and march production under which the company will receive a fixed price averaging per mcf on approximately mmcf d 
the hedges  which covered approximately one half of apache s expected natural gas production  will limit the upside potential from the physical sale of apache s natural gas during the first quarter of in addition to limiting first quarter gas prices  the hedges on the production resulted in a charge to current year earnings 
in late  a marketing anomaly developed in which nymex natural gas futures prices  commonly used as the reference price in hedge agreements  lost their correlation to wellhead prices 
due to frigid temperatures in the northeastern united states and pipeline constraints in the nation s gas transportation system  nymex natural gas prices rose substantially higher than prices received by producers west of the mississippi river 
producers  such as apache  with large volumes of production in texas and oklahoma were unable to realize the record increases in nymex prices 
as a result of this significant decoupling of nymex and wellhead prices  apache recognized a pre tax hedging loss of million in which was reported as a reduction of other revenues on the company s statement of consolidated income 
effective with contracts covering april and subsequent deliveries  apache has limited its hedges to production volumes deliverable to the northeastern united states 
prior year comparative information apache reported net income for of million  a three percent decrease from earnings of million 
the company s net income included a one time benefit of million  or 
per share  for the cumulative effects of a change in accounting principle related to the adoption of the liability method of accounting for income taxes under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
significant factors contributing to the higher income from continuing operations were increased oil production and substantially increased natural gas production  partially offset by decreases in oil and natural gas prices 
revenues for totaled million  or percent higher than in oil and gas production revenues in totaled million  an increase of percent over oil and gas production revenues of million in the prior year 
oil and gas production revenues in were influenced by record natural gas production  declining natural gas prices  increased oil production and lower average oil prices for the year 
in addition  apache s gathering  processing and marketing revenues increased percent to million in from million in natural gas sales contributed million to revenues  up percent from  the result of higher annual production partially offset by lower prices during gas production for the year averaged mmcf d  up percent from  positively affecting gas sales by million 
this increase is principally the result of production increases from developmental drilling and the contribution of months of operations from properties acquired in  the most significant of which were the offshore properties acquired from hall houston oil company hall houston and the properties added through apache s mid merger with hadson energy resources corporation subsequently known as apache energy resources corporation or aerc 
acquisitions added approximately mmcf d of production increases for the year  whereas developmental drilling and recompletions accounted for nearly mmcf d 
apache s average realized price for its natural gas was per mcf during  eight percent lower than the average price of per mcf during  which negatively affected natural gas sales by million 
natural gas prices remained depressed during the second half of due to warmer than usual weather in the northeastern united states and higher volumes of gas held in inventory by utilities and gas storage facilities 
hedging activities increased apache s natural gas price by 
per mcf million in sales compared to a 
per mcf decrease million in sales in the impact of increased oil production was offset by lower oil prices in oil production contributed million to revenues during  less than one percent below apache s oil sales in average daily oil production of approximately mbbls reflected a six percent increase over the prior year  positively affecting oil sales by million  as acquisitions offset the effects of natural depletion 
oil sales represented percent of total oil and gas production revenues in compared to percent of total oil and gas production revenues in the company s average realized oil price for of per barrel declined seven percent from  negatively affecting oil sales by million 
apache s average realized oil prices in ranged from per barrel in march to per barrel in july 
hedging activities increased apache s average realized oil price by 
per barrel million in sales as compared to a 
per barrel increase million in sales in the hedges were in the form of floating for fixed price swap agreements with respect to the sale of oil  whereas sales hedges were due to the price support hedging agreement with amoco production company 
revenues from the sale of natural gas liquids decreased four percent from  to million in revenues from gas gathering  processing and marketing were million in  up percent from the revenue increase primarily reflects additional volumes sold under crude oil and natural gas contracts  an activity that generally creates relatively low margins 
gross margins from gathering  processing and marketing were million in  an increase of percent from other revenues increased to million in  up from million in non recurring revenues in included million from the favorable resolution of take or pay contract issues  million in gains from the sale of stock held for investment and million of other income 
operating costs per equivalent unit of production declined percent in  as a percent increase in production volumes more than offset a six percent increase in operating costs 
aggregate operating costs increased from million in to million in on an equivalent unit of production basis  operating costs in declined to per boe  down from per boe in apache s declining costs per boe reflect increasing natural gas production and lower production costs 
dd a expense rose percent year over year to million due to increased oil and natural gas production and a higher us amortization rate expressed on a boe basis 
apache s us amortization rate increased from per boe in to per boe in due to higher finding costs during the last two years 
recurring international dd a expense increased as higher australian production more than offset the impact of lower canadian production 
although apache increased its international exploration activity in  international impairments declined to million in from million in  reflecting the company s successful international exploration efforts in china  egypt and indonesia during administrative  selling and other costs increased million in  or six percent from these costs  on an equivalent unit of production basis  declined percent from the prior year to 
per boe in from per boe in  reflecting the increase in production over the prior year and results of the company s continuing efforts to contain costs 
the company integrated aerc and the hall houston properties with minimal increases in administrative staff 
net financing costs of million were percent higher than  primarily a result of increasing interest rates and increased debt from acquisitions 
effective interest rates on apache s floating rate debt  which includes all advances under its bank credit facility  increased approximately percent over year end  as market rates increased at six different times during the year 
cash flow  liquidity and capital resources capital commitments apache s primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties  repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt  payment of dividends  and capital obligations for affiliated ventures 
the company generally funds its exploration and development activities through internally generated cash flows 
apache budgets its capital expenditures based upon projected cash flows and routinely adjusts its capital expenditures in response to changes in oil and natural gas prices and corresponding changes in cash flow

since  apache has spent approximately million on exploratory wells in the zhao dong block in china  with three successful wells 
apache  which recently announced plans to proceed with the second exploration phase under its contract with the people s republic of china  is continuing to appraise the field 
us and canadian expenditures for exploration and development in  including workover and recompletion operations  are expected to be comparable to the expenditure level 
the company expects its other international exploration and development expenditures in to total approximately million 
cash expenditures for acquisitions of oil and gas properties during totaled million as the company added mmboe of oil and gas reserves through purchases 
the most significant of the transactions apache completed during were the company s acquisition of properties from texaco and aquila

eliminating the effects of the forward sale transaction  net cash provided by operating activities in increased by five percent over  reflecting the results of increased production partially offset by lower gas prices and non recurring charges 
net cash provided by operating activities in was up million from primarily due to increased natural gas production and the million forward sale of gas 
long term borrowings on january   apache completed the issuance of million principal amount of its percent debentures to reduce bank debt  provide funding for acquisitions and for general corporate purposes 
the debentures are convertible at the option of the holder into apache common stock at a conversion price of per share

declined slightly from a ratio of 
at december  management believes that cash on hand at year end  net cash generated from operations and available borrowing capacity under its revolving bank credit facility will be adequate to satisfy the company s financial obligations to meet future liquidity needs for at least the next two fiscal years 
future trends apache s growth strategy is to increase oil and gas reserves  production and cash flow through a combination of acquisitions  moderate risk drilling and development of its inventory of existing properties 
an emerging aspect of apache s strategy is its exploration and development activity in the international arena where there are generally larger reserve targets than in north america 
in  apache expects domestic exploration and development outlays to be comparable to those reported in as the company focuses on reserve enhancement and cash flow acceleration on recently acquired properties 
internationally  the company projects capital expenditures to nearly double from as apache continues to exploit its concessions in western australia  egypt  china and indonesia 
proposed exploration and development expenditures in will be reviewed at least quarterly in light of fluctuating product prices and apache s objective to fund operations through internally generated cash flow 
natural gas marketing on september   the company s contract with ngc terminated  and apache began to market all of its own natural gas 
the company believes the prices that it obtains through its own marketing activities are not substantially different from the prices that would have been received through ngc 
in october  subsidiaries of apache  oryx energy company and parker parsley petroleum company announced their formation of producers energy marketing  llc proenergy  a natural gas marketing company organized to create a direct link between natural gas producers and purchasers 
proenergy is designed to purchase and sell producer owned gas directly into the marketplace at index prices substantially equivalent to spot market prices and provide expanded value to its customers 
until proenergy is fully operational  which is expected to occur in the second quarter of  apache will continue to market its own natural gas 
apache and other members of proenergy have agreed to fund the reasonably anticipated capital needs of proenergy 
in january  apache paid million to proenergy for apache s share of capital funding obligations for the start up of proenergy
