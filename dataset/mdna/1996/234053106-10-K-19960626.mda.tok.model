as of march   the company had a secured line of credit with an institutional lender which  subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  allowed the company to borrow up to million 
as of march   there was million outstanding under the line of credit and million was available for additional borrowings 
the line of credit was to mature in april in fiscal year  the company applied the net proceeds of the ipo together with certain other amounts received concurrently therewith to reduce outstanding debt under the line of credit 
as a result of this reduction in the indebtedness and the company s reduced borrowing needs  in may  the company entered into a new agreement with certain banks for a new three year unsecured revolving line of credit facility the new facility 
under the new facility  the company may borrow initially up to million until april  and up to million thereafter until maturity

during fiscal year  approximately million  or  of the company s net sales were sold through the company s canadian  mexican and us export operations  including latin america 
the company believes that international markets represent further opportunities for growth 
the company attempts to protect itself from foreign currency fluctuations by denominating substantially all of its non canadian international sales in us dollars 
in addition  in april the company entered into a one year forward exchange contract  which expired in april  in order to hedge the company s net investment in  and its intercompany payable applicable to  its canadian subsidiary

the company was recently appointed by a major manufacturer as the master distributor for a certain product line of consumable supplies throughout the united states  canada  mexico  the caribbean and latin america 
the company expects that this arrangement will result in incremental revenue growth  and similar to the company s other business and revenue growth  will impose additional working capital needs upon the company 
the company believes it will be able to satisfy its working capital needs for fiscal year  including such additional working capital required by this arrangement as well as planned capital expenditures  through funds available under the new facility  trade credit  lease financing  internally generated funds and by increasing the amount available under the new facility although the company has presently neither requested nor received any commitment to do so 
in addition  although the company has no plans to do so  and depending on market conditions and the terms thereof  the company may also consider obtaining additional funds through an additional line of credit  other debt financing or the sale of capital stock  however  no assurance can be given in such regard 
inventory management the company manages its inventories by maintaining sufficient quantities of product to achieve high order fill rates while at the same time maximizing inventory turnover rates 
inventory balances will fluctuate as the company adds new product lines and makes large purchases from suppliers to take advantage of attractive terms 
to reduce the risk of loss to the company due to supplier price reductions and slow moving inventory  the company s purchasing agreements with many of its suppliers  including most of its major suppliers  contain price protection and stock return privileges under which the company receives credits against future purchases if the supplier lowers prices on previously purchased inventory or the company can return slow moving inventory in exchange for other products 
seasonality although the company historically has experienced its greatest growth in revenues in its fourth fiscal quarter  management has not been able to determine the specific effect  if any  of seasonal factors that may cause quarterly variability in operating results 
management believes  however  that factors that may influence quarterly variability include the overall growth in the non paper computer supplies industry and shifts in demand for the company s products due to a variety of factors  including sales increases resulting from the introduction of new computer supplies products 
the company generally experiences a relative slowness in sales during the summer months  which may adversely affect the company s first and second fiscal quarter results in relation to sequential quarter performance 
the company believes that the results of operations for a quarterly period may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on the company s operations
