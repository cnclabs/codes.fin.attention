overview we are a full service  global provider of seismic data acquisition  processing and interpretation services to the oil and natural gas industry 
we also provide clients access  via licenses  to our multi client seismic data library 
as an acknowledged industry leader in land  marsh  swamp  transition zone and shallow water down to feet water depths ocean bottom cable or obc environments  we have the capacity to operate up to seismic crews with approximately  recording channels worldwide and the ability to process seismic data collected throughout the world 
crew count  configuration and location can change depending upon industry demand and requirements 
we provide a suite of geophysical services including acquisition of two dimensional d  three dimensional d  time lapse four dimensional d and multi component seismic data surveys  data processing and interpretation services and other geophysical services for customers in the oil and natural gas industry  which include many national oil companies  major international oil companies and independent oil and gas exploration and production companies collectively e p companies in the united states  canada  latin america including mexico  africa  australia  new zealand  asia pacific and the middle east 
seismic data is used by e p companies to identify and analyze drilling prospects  maximize drilling success  optimize field development and enhance production economics 
we also own a multi client data library whereby we maintain full or partial ownership of data acquired for future licensing 
our multi client data library consists of data covering various areas in the united states  canada  brazil and australia 
the seismic services industry is dependent upon the capital spending levels of oil and natural gas companies for exploration  development  exploitation and production of oil and natural gas 
these spending levels have traditionally been heavily influenced by the prices of oil and natural gas  however  budget cycles of national oil companies nocs and international oil companies iocs tend to be more strategic and longer term in nature 
since the third quarter of  oil and natural gas prices have shown significant volatility  and e p spending has been adjusted accordingly 
to the extent that exploration spending does not increase  our cash flows from operations could be directly affected 
while there are signs of recovery  if the world experiences a double dip to the recent global recession  commodity prices may be depressed for an extended period of time  which could alter acquisition and exploration plans  and adversely affect our growth strategy 
the pgs onshore acquisition in february  we closed the acquisition of the onshore seismic acquisition and multi client library business of petroleum geo services asa and certain of its subsidiaries pgs onshore acquisition 
the acquisition significantly increased our onshore seismic acquisition business in mexico  north africa  the far east and alaska 
the acquisition also substantially increased our multi client business  adding  square miles of d seismic data to our multi client library 
the purchase price was million  paid million in cash and million by the issuance of million shares of our common stock 
to finance this acquisition in december  we issued an additional  shares of common stock for net cash proceeds of million and our wholly owned subsidiary issued million of

the related financing transactions include the common stock issued to pgs  the senior secured notes due  the preferred stock restructuring  and the secured credit revolving credit facility 
other events in in addition to the pgs onshore acquisition and related financings  developments in our business during include the following we continue to expand our multi client library which consisted of approximately  square miles of d data and linear miles of d data immediately after the closing of the pgs onshore acquisition 
our new multi client program focuses on unconventional resource plays including the marcellus shale in pennsylvania and west virginia  woodford shale in oklahoma  haynesville shale in the east texas basin and in the niobrara shale in colorado and wyoming which brings our total acquired program to approximately  square miles of d data and  linear miles of d data 
our backlog increased to million at december  from million on a pro forma basis at december  bid activity has continued to be strong in and early at march   we had approximately  million of outstanding bids 
we launched our new geotiger series ii highly transportable component c obc crew to the canadian arctic and commenced operations in the second quarter 
this unique crew utilizes the state of the art sercel searay c obc system and is capable of being deployed worldwide in a matter of days via our proprietary geotiger series ii marine fleet 
this crew completed its first job in october and is currently operating in mexico 
on december   we closed a million private placement of  shares of a new series of junior preferred stock and warrants to purchase  million shares of our 
table of contents common stock to affiliates of avista  petroleum geo services asa  several of our directors and others 
the proceeds were used to repay indebtedness and for general corporate purposes 
we have continued to work with the lenders under our revolving credit facility to receive the required waivers and increase the available borrowings under the facility 
we may borrow up to million  based on a formula 
during  our lenders granted us financial covenant waivers during each of the second  third and fourth quarters 
the last amendment of the fourth quarter provides  among other things  adjustments to a monthly maximum total leverage ratio and a monthly minimum interest coverage ratio 
it also requires us to adhere to a monthly liquidity test  monthly senior notes interest reserve and monthly cumulative adjusted ebitda targets commencing with the month ending january  through the month ending december  furthermore  capital expenditures for the fiscal year may not exceed million 
we complied with these various financial covenants for the months ending january  and february  on april  we entered into a waiver of specific events of default that would have occurred on march  for failure to comply with financial reporting covenant requirements 
additionally  we entered into amendment no 
which modifies certain financial covenant requirements minimum total leverage ratio and cumulative adjusted ebitda and our interest cost 
the amendment also changes the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to april  while we believe we will remain in compliance with the revised covenants through december   our actual results may differ from our forecasts  and may be affected by events beyond our control 
liquidity and capital resources available liquidity our primary sources of cash have been cash flow generated by our seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing segments  sales of debt and equity securities  bank borrowings under our revolving credit facility  equipment financing and trade credit 
our primary uses of cash have been for acquisitions  including the pgs onshore acquisition  operating expenses associated with our seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing segments  capital expenditures associated with upgrading and expanding our capital asset base and debt service 
as of december   we had available liquidity as follows available cash in millions cash and cash equivalents cash due to customer total available cash undrawn borrowing capacity under revolving credit facility net available liquidity at december  borrowings under our revolving credit facility are limited by a borrowing base  which was million on december   and which decreases at the end of each month in an amount equal to an interest reserve as defined in the credit agreement 
we have certain foreign overdraft facilities in the amount of million which were undrawn at december  however  due to limitations on the ability to remit funds to the united states  these have been excluded in the available liquidity table above 

table of contents the table below summarizes certain measures of liquidity and capital expenditures  as well as our sources of capital from internal and external sources  for the past three years in thousands 
cash and equivalents  at december working capital  at december cash flow provided by operating activities cash flow provided by used in investing activities cash flow provided by used in financing activities capital expenditures including capital leases investment in multi client data library cash paid for interest cash flow provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the decrease in operational cash flow in is primarily due to the operating loss during the period  partially offset by non cash charges as well as receivable collections of million 
cash flow provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the amounts primarily result from changes in restricted cash for million  offset by cash used for the pgs onshore acquisition of million  investments in multi client data library of million and capital expenditures of million 
during  million of proceeds from the issuance of debt and common stock was deposited into escrow accounts for the pgs onshore acquisition  related debt payoff and other operational purposes 
additional amounts were invested in equipment and multi client data library 
cash flow provided by used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  these totals represent the net proceeds and net payments from our debt and equity transactions 
the amount in reflects the issuance of our senior secured notes due other during  we had an operating loss of million  while our cash flow from operating activities was million 
the difference of million is primarily due to non cash depreciation and amortization charges of million 
the cash generated by our operations  issuance of senior notes in  and the issuance of preferred shares in december  provided liquidity to meet our financing needs during on february   in connection with the closing of the pgs onshore acquisition we fully extinguished certain borrowings outstanding at december  which totaled approximately million 
accordingly  these outstanding balances were classified as current debt as of december  we recorded losses of million related to prepayment penalties during the year ended december  
table of contents capital resources revolving credit facility on february   we entered into our million revolving credit facility  which initially matured on february  on april   the maturity date was changed to april  see below 
amounts that may be outstanding under the revolving credit facility are limited by a borrowing base which is determined based on the amount of our north american receivables and fixed assets primarily equipment 
the amount that can be borrowed under the revolving credit facility is currently limited to million less the interest reserve as defined in the credit agreement 
borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a floating rate based on the greater of i per year  ii prime rate  iii above the federal funds rate  or iv above one month libor  plus an applicable margin which currently ranges between and depending on our total leverage ratio 
the rate was at december  the outstanding balance of this revolving credit facility was million as of december  and million as of february  on three occasions in  we amended the revolving credit facility to waive covenants we would have been unable to comply with without such waivers during each of the second  third and fourth quarters of among other things  we entered into amendments to revise our financial covenants including a monthly maximum total leverage ratio and a monthly minimum interest coverage ratio 
the amendments also require that we adhere to a monthly liquidity test  and monthly cumulative adjusted ebitda targets commencing with the month ending january  through the month ending december  we were in compliance with such covenants as of february  on april   geokinetics holdings entered into a waiver of specific events of default that would have occurred on march  for failure to comply with financial reporting covenant requirements 
additionally  we entered into amendment no 
which modifies certain financial covenant requirements minimum total leverage ratio and cumulative adjusted ebitda and our interest cost 
the amendment also changes the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to april  while we believe we will remain in compliance with the revised covenants through december   actual results may differ from our forecasts  and may be affected by events beyond our control 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are unconditionally guaranteed by us and each of our existing and each subsequently acquired or organized wholly owned us direct or indirect material subsidiary 
each of our entities guaranteeing the revolving credit facility will secure the guarantees on a first priority basis with a lien on substantially all of the assets of such guarantor 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are effectively senior to the notes with respect to the proceeds of any collateral securing both the revolving credit facility and the notes pursuant to the terms of an inter creditor agreement 
senior secured notes due on december   holdings issued million of senior secured notes due the notes 
the notes bear interest at the rate of per year  payable semi annually in arrears on june and december of each year  commencing june  the notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  by us  and by each of our current and future domestic subsidiaries 
we may redeem all or part of the notes at a prepayment premium which will decline over time 
we will be required to make an offer to repurchase the notes at of the principal amount plus accrued interest if we experience a change of control 
preferred stock in connection with the pgs onshore acquisition and our december common stock and notes offerings  on december   we restructured the series b preferred stock to reduce the 
table of contents conversion price from to  to increase the dividend of the series b preferred stock to  to extend the dates on which we may pay interest in kind and after which we are required to redeem the series b preferred stock until one year after the maturity date of the notes 
additionally  we agreed to exchange the series b preferred stock for a new series of preferred stock  series c  plus the issuance of  shares of our common stock and a fee of million  which was of the liquidation value of series b preferred stock 
the series c preferred stock is not convertible  and has a dividend rate of and an aggregate liquidation amount of million 
we have the ability to pay dividends on the series c preferred stock in kind or allow them to accrue without being paid  and will not be required to redeem the series c preferred stock for the liquidation amount until december   which is one year after the maturity of the notes 
in december   in order to meet working capital needs  we completed a million private placement of  shares of a new series of junior nonconvertible preferred stock the series d preferred stock and warrants the warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
interest expense is included in results of operations for all dividends on the series d preferred stock accrued from the date of issuance 
we can choose to pay these dividends in cash or accrue them 
the interest rate is per annum and compounded quarterly  if paid in cash  and per annum and compounded quarterly if accrued but not paid 
we are required to redeem series d preferred stock for the liquidation amount until december   which is one year after the maturity of the notes 
capital lease obligations and vendor financing from time to time  we enter into vendor financing arrangements to purchase certain equipment 
the equipment purchased from these vendors is paid over a period of time 
as of december   we have four equipment lease agreements with bradesco leasing in brazil with terms of months at a rate of per year 
the original amount of the leases was approximately million and the balance at december  was approximately million 
during  we may enter into additional capital leases and or vendor financing to fund expansion and maintenance capital expenditures 
future capital expenditures as discussed above  we have made  and expect to continue to make  significant investments in capital expenditures 
in  we made million in capital expenditures  primarily for new vessels for our shallow water operations  new information systems  investments in surveying and drilling equipment for crews relocating from north america and maintenance of our equipment and facilities 
as discussed above  our credit facility lenders have placed a maximum amount of capital expenditures for of million plus approved multi client data library investments for  the majority of which are pre funded 
this is a decrease of from capital expenditures in we plan these limited investments in to be primarily targeted toward expansion of our international operations and capital expenditures 
meeting our liquidity needs our revolving credit facility requires that we maintain certain financial ratios and tests 
as discussed above  during  we received waivers of compliance with certain of these financial covenants  and in december  we entered into an amendment to our revolving credit facility which reset these financial covenants for the amended financial covenants are based on our forecasted results of operations for we believe the assumptions used to prepare our forecasts are reasonable 
these assumptions include the amount and timing of seismic contracts that will be awarded to us  improvement in our operating efficiency and margin profitability 
we have complied with the amended financial covenants for the months ending january and february  on april  we entered into a waiver of specific events of default that would have occurred on march  
table of contents for failure to comply with financial reporting covenant requirements 
additionally  we entered into amendment no 
which modifies certain financial covenant requirements minimum total leverage ratio and cumulative adjusted ebitda and our interest cost 
the amendment also changes the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to april  while we believe we will remain in compliance with the revised covenants through december   our actual results may differ from our forecasts  and may be affected by events beyond our control 
we anticipate that our current cash balances and cash flows from operations in  combined with the available capacity under our revolving credit facility  will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs during this expectation  however  is subject to risks that the assumptions used to prepare the forecasts upon which the financial covenants in our revolving credit facility are based will not be achieved 
certain of these risks are described under item b 
risk factors in this annual report 
inflation  seasonality and competitive pricing we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations during the most recent three years 
traditionally  our business has been seasonal  with strongest demand in the second half of our fiscal year 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced increases in the level of normal seasonal year end bid requests by oil and gas companies and seismic contractor customers due to these customers taking a less conservative approach than in recent periods and beginning to increase their spending plans 
in times of decreased demand  our business is subject to increased price competition 
results of operations summary of overall performance for on a pro forma basis  with the pgs onshore acquisition  our revenues for were million less than  reflecting a decline in seismic acquisition work 
we believe this decline was caused by the reduction in demand for oil and gas caused by the global recession which began in as a result of these factors  our net loss in was significantly higher than in results of operations for year ended december  compared to operating revenues 
consolidated revenues for the twelve months ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of 
the increase in revenues was primarily driven by the addition of the pgs onshore operations and the contribution from the multi client data library business in the us for the twelve months ended december   seismic data acquisition revenue totaled million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of 
north america revenues increased by million to a total of million  which represents an increase of from the same twelve month period in revenues increased as a result of higher crew utilization in the united states coupled with revenues from multi client in both pre funding deliveries and late sales 
multi client data library licensing revenues totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
despite improved revenues in north america  revenues from the international data acquisition segment were negatively impacted by lower utilization from a job mix that included less shallow water work  project commencement delays and weather downtime 
seismic acquisition revenues from international operations were million or of total seismic data acquisition revenue compared with million or of total seismic data acquisition related revenue for the same period in 
table of contents seismic data processing revenue totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period of  a decrease of 
the decline in revenue is the result of depressed pricing in north america and internationally 
additionally  the revenue generated from proprietary data processing work has declined slightly due to our increased focus on multi client work in the united states 
operating expenses 
consolidated direct operating costs increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in changes in operating expense as a percentage of revenues is discussed below and is related to overall increased costs related to operating additional pgs onshore crews in north america and internationally 
seismic acquisition operating expenses from north america increased by million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared with the same period of international seismic acquisition expenses increased by million to million for the twelve months ended december  compared with the same period of seismic acquisition operating expenses increased to million for the twelve months ended december  from million for the same period of seismic acquisition operating expenses as a percentage of revenue were for the twelve months ended december  as compared to for the same period in the prior year 
this increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenue is a result of higher idle costs in international operations coupled with a change in our job mix globally 
seismic acquisition operating expenses from north america for the year ended december  were million  or of total north america seismic data acquisition revenue  compared to million  or of total north america seismic data acquisition revenue for the same period in the costs as a percentage of revenue have decreased due to a higher contribution from multi client data library sales coupled with increased crew efficiency and equipment utilization as a result of the pgs onshore acquisition 
seismic acquisition operating expenses from international operations for the year ended december  were million  or of total international seismic data acquisition revenue  compared to million  or of total international seismic data acquisition revenue for the same period in international operating expenses are higher as a result of decreased activity levels due to delays in project awards and project commencements and higher as a percentage of revenue due to certain fixed costs for idle crews and vessels 
data processing expenses were slightly higher at million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in to remain competitive  we accepted lower margin jobs while processing a higher volume of data during general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  were million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of million or 
this increase is primarily due to the costs associated with the integration of the pgs onshore acquisition including severance costs and higher salary expense associated with increased personnel levels 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense for the twelve months ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of million or 
this is primarily attributable to continued capital expenditures to support international crews along with the amortization of the multi client investment and the purchase of million of pgs onshore fixed assets 
we incurred capital expenditures of million in as compared to million in amortization of multi client data for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense net of interest income for the twelve months ended december  increased by million or to million as compared to approximately million for the same period of this increase is primarily due to interest expense of million related to the senior secured notes due and respective deferred issue costs and discount accretion 
interest expense also included a million charge related to the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock 
change in derivative liabilities 
the million non cash loss for the twelve months ended december  compared to a non cash loss of million for the twelve months ended december  is related to recording the change in fair value of the derivatives liabilities 
the derivatives were revalued using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
one of the variables used to determine the fair value of the derivative liabilities is our stock price 
when the value of our stock increases  so does the value of the derivatives 
therefore  the increase in our stock price contributed to the non cash loss 
for additional information  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report of form k 
income tax 
provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended december  was million  as compared to million for the same period of  a decrease of million or 
the decrease is mainly due to losses in foreign jurisdictions 
in addition  we recorded a million interest charge during on the amounts accrued for uncertain tax positions 
ebitda and net loss 
ebitda as defined below decreased to million for compared to million for this decrease was due to decreased international revenues combined with decreased activity levels due to delays in project awards and project commencements 
in addition  we had increased expenses from the pgs onshore acquisition 
we had a loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per share  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to a loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per share  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in our net loss applicable to stockholders resulted primarily from the same variables impacting ebitda as well as the increase in interest expense related to the senior secured notes due and the mandatorily redeemable preferred stock described above 
we define ebitda as net income loss the most directly generally accepted accounting principle or gaap financial measure before interest  taxes  other income expense including foreign exchange gains losses  gains losses on disposal of equipment and insurance proceeds  gains losses from change in fair value of derivative liabilities and other income expense  and depreciation and amortization 
ebitda  as used and defined by us  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies and is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
ebitda should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  net income or loss  cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities  or other income or cash flow statement data prepared in accordance with gaap 
however  we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because this measure is widely used by investors in the energy industry to measure a company operating performance without regard to items excluded from the calculation of such term  which can vary substantially from company to company depending upon accounting methods and book value of assets  capital structure and the method by which assets were acquired  among other factors  helps investors to more meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the effect of our capital structure and asset base from its operating structure  and is used by our management for various purposes  including as a measure of operating performance  in presentations to our board of directors  as a basis for strategic planning and forecasting  and as a component for setting incentive compensation 
there are significant limitations to using ebitda as a measure of performance  including the inability to analyze the effect of certain recurring and non recurring items that materially 
table of contents affect our net income or loss  and the lack of comparability of results of operations of different companies

revenues for the twelve months ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of 
this increase in revenue is attributable primarily to our international seismic data acquisition segment 
for the twelve months ended december   seismic data acquisition revenue totaled million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of 
this increase in seismic data acquisition revenue is primarily attributable to investment in additional international crew capacity and continued strong demand for our services in niche markets such as obc and transition zone 
seismic data acquisition revenues for the twelve months ended december  includes million or from north america  and million or from international 
seismic data processing revenue totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the same period of  a decrease of due to decreased demand and increased price competition 
revenues include data library licensing revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
operating expenses 
operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the same period of of the total operating expenses  seismic data acquisition operating expenses totaled million for the twelve months ended december   as compared to million for the same period of while seismic data acquisition revenues increased by  data acquisition operating expenses remained the same due to the shift in job mix towards higher margin  international programs 
seismic data acquisition operating expenses for the twelve months ended december  includes million  or  from north america  and million  or from international 
seismic data processing operating expenses totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the same period of  a decrease of primarily due to lower activity levels 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the twelve months ended december  were million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of million or 
this increase is primarily the result of salary expenses associated with increased personnel levels due to our overall growth  the strengthening of our infrastructure consisting primarily of information systems implementation costs  severance costs  and costs incurred related to the pgs onshore acquisition 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expense for the twelve months ended december  totaled million as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of million or 
this is primarily attributable to continued capital expenditures to support international crews along with the amortization of the multi client investment 
we incurred capital expenditures of million in as compared to million in amortization of multi client data for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense net of interest income for the twelve months ended december  decreased by million or to million as compared to approximately million for the same period of other 
during  we incurred a million charge for a bridge commitment we obtained in connection with the signing of the purchase agreement to purchase pgs onshore 
change in derivative liabilities 
the million non cash loss for the year ended december  is related to the change in fair value of the derivatives liabilities 
the derivatives were revalued using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
the recognition of the change in fair value is the result of the adoption of asc effective january  income tax 
provision for income taxes for the twelve months ended december  was million  as compared to million for the same period of  an increase of million or 
the increase is mainly due to increased profitability in foreign jurisdictions and related withholding taxes 
the increase is mainly due to increased profitability in foreign jurisdictions  increased activity in deemed profit areas where taxes are calculated as a percentage of revenues and increased withholding taxes on the rental of our united states owned equipment to our foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  we recorded a million charge during for an uncertain tax position in one of our foreign operations 
ebitda and net loss 
ebitda as defined below increased to million for compared to million for this increase was due to increased international revenues and improved international margins  primarily as a result of a higher contribution from shallow water obc and transition zone projects 
we also had better crew utilization and less down time due to longer term contracts 
we had a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per share  for the twelve months ended december   as compared to a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  or per share  for the twelve months ended december  the increase in our net loss applicable to stockholders is primarily due to million of one time inducement payments to preferred stockholders  the bridge loan fee  and acquisition costs related to the pgs onshore acquisition and a million loss from change in fair value of derivative liabilities

table of contents inflation and price changes 
we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations during the most recent three years 
foreign currency exchange risk 
we operate in certain countries where we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk 
as the majority of our contracts are denominated in us dollars  when possible  we mitigate this risk by entering into split dollar contracts 
under a split dollar contract  each client invoice is split into a local currency payment and a us dollar payment 
the local currency payment is collected locally and used to fund local expenditures  while the us dollar payment is made directly to a us dollar denominated bank account 
this reduces our exposure to foreign currency risks 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet arrangements for the twelve months ended december  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources that are material to investors 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our obligations and commitments to make future payments of principal and interest under its long term debt  capital leases  notes payable  mandatorily redeemable preferred stock and operating leases for the periods specified as of december   in thousands contractual obligations table total less than year years years over years long term debt and capital lease obligations interest on long term debt mandatorily redeemable preferred stock operational leases total discount on long term debt and mandatory redeemable preferred stock total  net of discount amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts committed less than year years years over years standby letters of credit includes accrued interest 
includes minimum obligation for marine vessels on renewable month time charter 
during  we entered into various financing activities as further described in liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be predicted with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies involve the application of critical accounting estimates 
fair values of financial instruments effective january   we adopted asc topic as it relates to financial assets and financial liabilities  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
this guidance defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
hierarchical levels  as defined in this guidance and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuations of these assets and liabilities and we have indicated the level of data utilized with respect to each financial instrument fair value disclosure 
we are not a party to any hedge arrangements  commodity swap agreement or other derivative financial instruments 
our seismic data acquisition and seismic data processing segments utilize foreign subsidiaries and branches to conduct operations outside of the united states 
these operations expose us to market risks from changes in foreign exchange rates 
revenue recognition our services are provided under cancelable service contracts 
customer contracts for services vary in terms and conditions 
contracts are either turnkey or term agreements or a combination of the two 
under turnkey agreements or the turnkey portions thereof  we recognize revenue based upon output measures as work is performed 
this method requires that we recognize revenue based upon quantifiable measures of progress  such as square miles or linear kilometers acquired 
with respect to those contracts where the customer pays separately for the mobilization of equipment  we recognize such mobilization fees as revenue during the performance of the seismic data acquisition  using the same performance method as for the acquisition work 
we also receive revenue for certain third party charges under the terms of the service contracts 
we record amounts billed to customers in revenue as the gross amount including third party charges  if applicable  that are paid by the customer 
our turnkey or term contracts generally do not contain cancellation provisions that would prevent us from being compensated for work performed prior to cancellation due to work not being met or work not 
table of contents being performed within a particular timeframe 
in some instances  customers are billed in advance of work performed and we recognize the advance billing as deferred revenue 
we account for multi client data sales as follows a pre funding arrangements we obtain funding from customers before a seismic project is completed 
in return for the pre funding  the customer typically gains the ability to direct or influence the project specifications  to access data as it is being acquired and to pay discounted prices 
we recognize pre funding revenue as the services are performed on a proportional performance basis usually determined by comparing the completed square miles of a seismic survey to the survey size unless specific facts and circumstances warrant another measure 
progress is measured in a manner generally consistent with the physical progress on the project  and revenue is recognized based on the ratio of the project progress to date  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
b late sales when we grant a license to a customer  the customer is entitled to have access to a specifically defined portion of the multi client data library 
our customer license payment is fixed and determinable and typically is required at the time that the license is granted 
we recognize revenue for late sales when our customer executes a valid license agreement and has received the underlying data or has the right to access the licensed portion of the data and collection is reasonably assured 
c sales of data jointly owned by us and partner we have jointly acquired surveys with a partner whereby we share the costs of acquisition and earn license revenues when processed data is delivered by our partner to the ultimate client 
as such  these revenues are recognized when the processed data is delivered to the ultimate client 
deferred revenue consists primarily of customer payments made in advance of work done  progress billings and mobilization revenue  amortized over the term of the related contract 
multi client data library we capitalize all costs directly associated with acquiring and processing the data  including the depreciation of the assets used during production of the surveys 
we refer to these costs as our gross multi client investment 
the capitalized cost of the multi client data is charged to depreciation and amortization in the period the sales occur based on the greater of the percentage of total estimated costs to the total estimated sales in the first five years multiplied by actual sales  known as the sales forecast method  or the straight line amortization method over five years 
this minimum straight line amortization is recorded only if minimum amortization exceeds the cost of services calculated using the sales forecast method 
we periodically review the carrying value of the multi client data library 
if during any such review  we determine that the future revenue for a multi client survey is expected to be more or less than the original estimate of total revenue  we decrease or increase as the case may be the amortization rate attributable to the future revenue from the multi client survey 
furthermore  in connection with the review  we evaluate the recoverability of the multi client data library  and if required under asc accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  records an impairment charge with respect to the multi client survey 
there were no impairment charges determined for and derivative liabilities we have convertible preferred stock issued and outstanding and common stock warrants issued in connection with a preferred stock issuance in july and december both the convertible preferred stock conversion feature and warrants contain a price protection provision or down round provision which reduces their price in the event we issue additional shares at a more favorable price than the strike price 

table of contents the financial accounting standard board fasb accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts is included in asc derivatives and hedging contracts in entity own equity scope and scope exceptions 
this standard provides that an instrument strike price or the number of shares used to calculate the settlement amount are not fixed if its terms provide for any potential adjustment  regardless of the probability of such adjustment s or whether such adjustments are in the entity control 
if equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to its own stock  based on the instrument contingent exercise and settlement provisions  for periods ended after the adoption date of january   the fair value of the conversion feature is bifurcated from the host instrument and recognized as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
the warrants are recognized at fair value as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of the conversion feature  the warrants and other issuance costs of the preferred stock financing transaction  are recognized as a discount to the preferred stock host 
the discount embedded in series b preferred stock is accreted to the preferred stock host from our paid in capital  treated as a deemed dividend  over the period from the issuance date through the earliest redemption date of the preferred stock 
the discount embedded in series d junior preferred stock is accreted to the preferred stock from the period from issuance date through the redemption date and is recorded in interest expense 
goodwill we perform impairment tests on the carrying value of our goodwill on an annual basis 
as of december  we used a combination of the discounted cash flow method and the subject company market approach 
the discounted cash flow method focuses on expected cash flows 
in applying this approach  the expected cash flow is projected based on assumptions regarding revenues  direct costs  general and administrative expenses  depreciation  applicable income taxes  capital expenditures and working capital requirements for a finite period of years  which was five years in our test 
the projected cash flows and the terminal value  which is an estimate of the value at the end of the finite period and assumes a long term growth rate  are then discounted to present value to derive an indication of the value of the reporting unit 
due to the economic conditions affecting the industry  we also utilized the subject company market approach which makes a comparison of our projections to reasonably similar publicly traded companies 
in weighting the results of the various valuation approaches  we placed more emphasis on the income approach 
at december   our annual impairment test indicated the fair value of our reporting unit goodwill exceeded the carrying amount by over recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued an update to asc  revenue recognition 
this asu addresses the accounting for multiple deliverables contained in a single sales arrangement 
we adopted this new guidance on january  accordingly  we apply this guidance to transactions initiated or materially modified on or after january  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued new accounting guidance to require additional fair value related disclosures including transfers into and out of levels and and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level measurements 
it also clarifies existing fair value disclosure guidance about the level of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques 
this new guidance is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  except for the requirement to separately disclose purchases  sales  issuances and settlements relating to level measurements  which is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december  our adoption of this new guidance did not have a material impact on its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we have included additional disclosure related to early adoption of the 
table of contents level related gross disclosure requirement  which is effective in  disclosures had no impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an update to asc  business combinations 
this asu addresses the disclosure of comparative financial statements and expands on the supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
we will adopt this asu prospectively for business combinations occurring on or after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
these risks arise primarily as a result of potential changes to operating concentration and credit risk  changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate risks 
additionally  we are exposed to market risk with respect to our own equity securities 
these risks are further discussed below 
concentration and credit risk our principal market risks include fluctuations in commodity prices which affect demand for and pricing of our services and the risk related to the concentration of our customers in the oil and natural gas industry 
since all of our customers are involved in the oil and natural gas industry  there may be a positive or negative effect on our exposure to credit risk because our customers may be similarly affected by changes in economic and industry conditions 
as an example  changes to existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations may unfavorably impact us  our suppliers or our customers 
in the normal course of business  we provide credit terms to our customers 
accordingly  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and maintain allowances for possible losses which  when realized  have been within the range of our expectations 
we believe that our unreserved trade receivables at december  of million are collectible and that our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate 
we generally provide services to a relatively small group of key customers that account for a significant percentage of our accounts receivable at any given time 
our key customers vary over time 
we extend credit to various companies in the oil and natural gas industry  including our key customers  for the acquisition of seismic data  which results in a concentration of credit risk 
this concentration of credit risk may be affected by changes in the economic or other conditions of our key customers and may accordingly impact our overall credit risk 
if any of these significant clients were to terminate their contracts or fail to contract for our services in the future because they are acquired  alter their exploration or development strategy  or for any other reason  our results of operations could be affected 
for the year ended december   our top ten customers petr leos mexicanos pemex  petroleo brasileiro sa petrobras petrobras  eni spa  sonangol  oxy usa inc  bp  petroleum company of trinidad and tobago limited petrotrin  petrogal brasil  almitra energy services sdn 
bhd  and vintage production california  llc 
these top customers represented of our consolidated revenue for our two largest customers in  pemex and petrobras  accounted for and of total revenue  respectively 
because of the nature of our contracts and customers projects  our largest customers can change from year to year and the largest customers in any year may not be indicative of the largest customers in any subsequent year 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates through our fixed rate long term debt 
typically  the fair market value of fixed rate long term debt will increase as prevailing interest rates decrease and will decrease as prevailing interest rates increase 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices where applicable  or based on the present value of expected cash flows 
table of contents relating to the debt discounted at rates currently available to us for long term borrowings with similar terms and maturities 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt was million as of december  and million at december  we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes on the outstanding indebtedness under our senior credit facility which has variable interest rates 
amounts drawn under the credit facility bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus a margin or the alternative base rate as defined in the agreement 
the interest rate margin applicable to libor advances varies based on our total leverage ratio 
the hypothetical impact on an average outstanding balance of our variable rate indebtedness of million from a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would be an increase in interest expense of approximately million per quarter 
we have cash in bank and restricted cash which  at times  may exceed federally insured limits 
restricted cash includes cash held to collateralize standby letters of credit and performance guarantees 
historically  we have not experienced any losses in such accounts 
recent volatility in financial markets may impact our credit risk on cash and short term investments 
at december   unrestricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we operate in a number of international areas and are involved in transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which expose us to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we utilize the payment structure of customer contracts to selectively reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations in connection with monetary assets  liabilities and cash flows denominated in certain foreign currencies 
we do not hold or issue foreign currency forward contracts  option contracts or other derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
we have designated the us dollar as the functional currency for most of our operations in international locations because we contract with customers  purchase equipment and finance capital using the us dollar 
in those countries where we have designated the us dollar as the functional currency  certain assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated at historical exchange rates  revenues and expenses in these countries are translated at the average rate of exchange for the period  and all translation gains or losses are reflected in the period results of operations 
our net foreign exchange gain attributable to our international operations was million for the year ended december  there are many factors affecting foreign exchange rates and resulting exchange gains and losses  most of which are beyond our control 
during the twelve months ended  december   we derived million or of our revenues from international operations 
it is not possible for us to predict the extent to which we may be affected by future changes in exchange rates and exchange controls 
equity risk under the terms of our series b preferred stock and existing warrants and options to purchase our common stock  the holders of these instruments are given an opportunity to profit from a rise in the market price of our common stock that  upon the conversion of our series b preferred stock and the exercise of the warrants and or options  could result in dilution in the interests of our other stockholders 
as fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements  series b stockholders have various additional rights  including dividends  consent of holders to  among other things  enter into a business combination or declare dividends 
the holders of our preferred stock have the preemptive right to acquire shares of our common stock that we may offer for cash in the future  other than shares sold in a public offering and the conversion price of the series b shares is subject to a down round provision which may increase their holdings in the event of any offering 
the terms on which we may obtain additional financing may be adversely affected by the existence and potentially dilutive impact of our series b preferred stock  and common stock options and warrants 

table of contents we are required to account for the conversion feature preferred stock related embedded derivative and investor warrants as derivative liabilities 
geokinetics is required to mark to market in each reporting quarter the value of the embedded derivative and investor warrants 
we revalue these derivative liabilities at the end of each reporting period 
derivative liabilities are presented as a long term liability on the balance sheet and totaled million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
the periodic change in value of the derivative liabilities is recorded as either non cash derivative income if the value of the embedded derivative and investor warrants decrease or as non cash derivative expense if the value of the embedded derivative and investor warrants increase 
although the values of the embedded derivative and warrants are affected by interest rates  the remaining contractual conversion period and our stock volatility  the primary cause of the change in the values will be the value of our common stock 
if the stock price goes up  the value of these derivatives will generally increase and if the stock price goes down the value of these derivatives will generally decrease 
our stock has historically been volatile  as a result  periodic gain or loss from change in fair value of derivative liabilities may be material 
change in fair value of derivatives is detailed in the condensed consolidated statements of operations under the section other income expenses and is discussed in the previous section 
the loss from the change in fair value of derivative liabilities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively
