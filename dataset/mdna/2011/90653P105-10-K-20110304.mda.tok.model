company overview union drilling  inc union drilling  company or we provides contract land drilling services and equipment  primarily to oil and natural gas producers 
in addition to drilling rigs  we provide the drilling crews and most of the ancillary equipment needed to operate our drilling rigs 
we provide drilling services to customers engaged in developing oil and natural gas bearing formations in selected areas of the united states 
our strategy is to focus on areas that have high growth potential  adequate takeaway capacity and low finding and development costs in order to maximize utilization and return on capital throughout the commodity price cycle 
during  oil prices rebounded while natural gas prices did not 
in response to this development  we repositioned the majority of our texas based rigs that were previously drilling for natural gas into west texas to drill for oil 
in addition  several of our rigs drilling for natural gas are now concentrated in areas where the produced gas has a component of natural gas liquids that generate a higher return for our customers in the current price environment 
our principal operations are in the appalachian basin  extending from new york to tennessee including the marcellus  huron  and utica shales  as well as the clinton  medina  and oriksany sands  the arkoma basin in eastern oklahoma and arkansas  including the fayetteville  caney  and woodford shales  and the fort worth basin in north texas  including the barnett shale and in west texas  the permian and delaware basins 
we commenced operations in with drilling rigs and related equipment acquired from an entity providing contract drilling services under the name union drilling 
through a combination of acquisitions  new rig construction and divestitures of older  smaller equipment  we currently operate a fleet of marketed land drilling rigs 
we continue to enhance our fleet of drilling rigs with technological capabilities through upgrades  acquisitions or new rig construction in order to improve drilling productivity and reduce total well costs for our customers 
at various times  we remove rigs from our marketed fleet  and the components are sold or made available for use on our other rigs 
key indicators of financial performance for management key performance measurements in our industry are rig utilization  revenue per revenue day and operating expenses per revenue day 
revenue days for each rig are days when the rig is earning revenues under a contract  which is usually a period from the date the rig begins moving to the drilling location until the rig is released from the contract 
we compute rig utilization rates by dividing revenue days by total available days during a period 
total available days are the number of calendar days during the period that we have owned the marketed rig 

table of contents the following table summarizes management s key indicators of financial performance for each of the three years in the period ended december  years ended december  revenue days average number of marketed rigs marketed rig utilization rates revenue per revenue day operating expenses per revenue day our business is substantially dependent on and affected by the level of us land based oil and natural gas exploration and development activity 
as a result of the decline in natural gas prices commencing in the second half of  overall demand for drilling services correspondingly decreased and we reached a utilization trough in the third quarter of since that time  particularly during  we experienced improvement in our marketed rig utilization rates due to a shift to oil drilling and relatively stable demand for natural gas drilling in shale plays 
however  as term contracts with higher rates expired and re priced in the current market  our revenue per revenue day declined in compared to in conjunction with the improvement of our marketed rig utilization  we incurred additional start up costs to return idled rigs to operations  which also decreased our drilling margin per revenue day 
we devote substantial resources to maintaining and upgrading our rig fleet 
on a regular basis  we remove certain rigs from service to perform upgrades 
in the short term  these actions result in fewer revenue days and slightly lower utilization  however  in the long term  we believe the upgrades will help the marketability of the rigs and improve their operating performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue and cost recognition 
we generate revenue principally by drilling wells for oil and natural gas producers under daywork or footage contracts  which provide for the drilling of single or multiple well projects 
revenues on daywork contracts are recognized based on the days worked at the dayrate each contract specifies 
mobilization fees are recognized as the related drilling services are provided 
we recognize revenues on footage contracts based on the footage drilled for the applicable accounting period 
expenses are recognized based on the costs incurred during that same accounting period 
reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses are recorded as revenues and direct expenses 
accounts receivable 
we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers based on their financial information  if available  information obtained from major industry suppliers  and our past experiences  if any  with the customer 
in some instances  we require new customers to make prepayments 
we typically invoice our customers semi monthly during the performance of the contracts and upon completion of the contract  with payment due within days 
we established an allowance for doubtful accounts of million and million at december  and  respectively 
any allowance established is subject to judgment and estimates made by management 
we determine our allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  our previous loss history  our assessment of our customers current abilities to pay obligations to us and the condition of the general economy and the oil and natural gas industry as a whole 
our bad debt expense was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
we write off specific accounts receivable when we determine they are uncollectible 
during  we wrote off million of accounts receivable for one customer 
during  we wrote off million of accounts receivable for two customers 
at december  and  our unbilled receivables totaled million and million  respectively  all of which relates to the revenue recognized  but not yet billed  on contracts in progress at december  and  respectively 
the million decrease at december  compared to december  is due to the timing of progress billings 

table of contents asset impairments 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger an impairment review would be any significant negative trends in the industry or the general economy  our contract revenue rates  our rig utilization rates  cash flows generated from operating our drilling rigs  existence of term drilling contracts  current and future oil and natural gas prices  industry analysts outlook for the oil and gas industry and their view of our customers access to capital and the trends in the price of used drilling equipment observed by our management 
if a review of our long lived assets indicates that our carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is made to adjust the carrying value to the estimated fair value 
cash flows are estimated by management considering factors such as expectations of future industry trends and the impact on dayrates  utilization and operating expenses  historical performance of the asset  the remaining expected life of the asset  any cash investment required to make the asset more marketable  suitability  specification and size of the rig  terminal value  as well as overall competitive dynamics 
use of different assumptions could result in an impairment charge different from that reported 
in  no impairments were required due to modestly improving conditions in the us land based drilling industry 
depreciation 
we provide for depreciation of our drilling rigs  transportation and other equipment on a straight line method over useful lives that we have estimated and that range from two to years 
unlike depreciation based on units of production  our approach to depreciation does not change when equipment becomes idle or when utilization changes 
we continue to depreciate idled equipment on a straight line basis despite the fact that our revenues and operating costs may vary with changes in utilization levels 
our estimates of the useful lives of our drilling  transportation and other equipment are based on our experience in the drilling industry with similar equipment 
deferred taxes 
we record deferred taxes for the basis difference in our property and equipment between financial reporting and tax reporting purposes and other costs such as compensation  employee benefits and other accrued liabilities which are deductible in different periods for financial reporting and tax reporting purposes 
for property and equipment  basis differences arise from differences in depreciation periods and methods and the value of assets acquired in a business acquisition where we acquire the stock of an entity rather than its assets 
for financial reporting purposes  we depreciate the various components of our drilling rigs and refurbishments over two to years  while federal income tax rules require that we depreciate drilling rigs and refurbishments over five years 
in and  tax depreciation also included bonus depreciation allowed as a result of the american recovery and reinvestment act of and the economic stimulus act of  respectively 
in  bonus depreciation is not expected to create any current tax benefit and is not included in our tax depreciation calculations 
in the earlier years of our ownership of a drilling rig  our tax depreciation may often exceed our financial reporting depreciation  resulting in our recording deferred tax liabilities on this depreciation difference 
in later years  financial reporting depreciation exceeds tax depreciation  and the deferred tax liability begins to reverse 
accrued workers compensation 
the company accrues for costs under our workers compensation insurance program in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
we have a deductible of  per covered accident under our workers compensation insurance 
our insurance policies require us to maintain letters of credit to cover our deductible payments 
as of december  and  we satisfied this requirement with letters of credit totaling million and million  respectively 
we accrue for these costs as claims are incurred based on cost estimates established for each claim by the insurance companies providing the administrative services for processing the claims  including estimates for incurred but not reported claims  claims paid directly by us  administrative costs associated with these claims  and our historical experience with these types of claims 
in addition  as needed  we accrue the estimated workers compensation premium payable to ohio  a monopolistic state  when our rigs work in that state 
stock based compensation 
compensation cost resulting from share based payment awards are measured at fair value and recognized in general and administrative expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the amount of compensation cost recognized at any date is at least equal to the portion of the grant date fair value of the award that is vested at that date 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded stock based compensation expense of million million net of tax  million million net of tax  and million million net of tax  respectively 
total unamortized stock based compensation was approximately million at december   and will be recognized over a weighted average service period of years 
any tax benefit realized from stock options exercised is included as a cash inflow from financing activities on the statement of cash flows 

table of contents estimating the fair value of options granted requires us to utilize valuation models and to establish several underlying assumptions 
the fair value of option grants was estimated using the black scholes option valuation model based on the following weighted average assumptions risk free interest rate expected life years years years dividend yield expected volatility the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available for zero coupon us government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life of the options 
the expected lives of the options are determined based on the company s expectations of individual option holders anticipated behavior and the term of the option 
the company has not paid out dividends historically  thus  the dividend yield is estimated at zero percent 
volatility is based upon price performance of the company and prior to november included a peer company  as the company did not have a sufficient historical price base to determine potential volatility over the term of the issued options 
results of operations our operations primarily consist of drilling oil or natural gas wells for our customers under either daywork contracts and  to a lesser extent  footage contracts 
contract terms we offer generally depend on the complexity and risk of operations  the on site drilling conditions  the type of equipment used  the anticipated duration of the work to be performed and the overall demand for rigs in our markets 
our contracts generally provide for the drilling of a specified number of wells or a specific period of time for which the rig will be under contract 
statements of operations analysis the following table provides selected information about our operations for the years ended december   and in thousands 
years ended december  revenues operating expenses depreciation and amortization impairment charge general and administrative expense interest expense other income and gain on disposal of assets effective income tax rate revenues 
the million or increase in revenues in compared to was primarily due to the increase in our marketed rig utilization from in to in  as a result of the improvement in the level of us land based drilling that began in the second half of particularly directed for oil drilling  and partially offset by lower dayrates 
the million  or decrease in revenues in compared to was primarily due to the decrease in our marketed rig utilization  from in to in  as a result of the decline in the level of us land based natural gas exploration and development activity that began in the second half of 
table of contents operating expenses 
our operating expenses in compared to increased million  or  primarily due to the increase in marketed rig utilization  additional costs incurred to prepare certain idled rigs to return to operation during and increased safety training and supplies costs 
in addition  employment costs increased beginning in the first half of as the company restored wage reductions that were implemented in in response to the deteriorating market conditions 
the million  or decrease in operating expenses in compared to was due to the decrease in our marketed rig utilization 
employment costs  fuel  supplies and repairs and maintenance costs decreased as a result of having a greater number of idled rigs compared to the prior year 
depreciation and amortization 
the million  or  increase in depreciation and amortization expense in compared to was due to the increase in depreciable assets  resulting from three rig purchases and various other capital equipment upgrades in that enhanced our fleet capabilities 
capital expenditures were million in the million  or increase in depreciation and amortization expense in compared to was primarily due to the increase in depreciable assets 
during the first half of  rig purchases and capital equipment upgrades were added to our fleet as part of our capital spending program 
capital expenditures were million in impairment charge 
during  there were no impairment charges recognized while in  million of impairment charges were recognized related to certain long lived assets to write down the carrying value of these assets to fair value 
the million impairment charge in was related to goodwill impairment recognized in the fourth quarter of general and administrative expenses 
our general and administrative expenses decreased slightly  or million  in compared to this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts  as well as lower corporate insurance rates and property taxes in compared to these decreases were partially offset by higher employment costs due to increased headcount as well as consulting fees related to a new information system conversion and implementation 
the million  or decrease in compared to was primarily due to a million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts  as well as decreased employment costs and other cost reductions in response to the decrease in operations 
interest expense 
the  increase in interest expense in compared to was primarily attributable to the increase in the average balance of our revolving credit  proceeds of which were used to partially fund our capital spending program 
there was no significant change in interest expense in compared to other income and gain on disposal of assets 
other income and gain loss on disposal of assets increased million in compared to due to a gain on the settlement of a rig physical insurance claim as well as gains from the disposal of non core assets 
the  decrease in other income and gain loss on disposal of assets in over is primarily due to fewer gains on disposal of drillpipe 
in addition  includes a  gain on involuntary conversions related to rig damages 
taxes 
our effective income tax rates of   and for  and  respectively  differ from the federal statutory rate of  primarily due to the non deductible goodwill impairment charge in  and the domestic manufacturing deduction in  state income taxes and permanent book tax differences such as those associated with the deduction limitation on per diem meals expense  the domestic manufacturing deduction and stock based compensation 
see note to our financial statements for further information on our income taxes 
the increase in income tax benefit in compared to was primarily due to the increase in pre tax loss in  as well as an increase in the effective income tax rates in at december  and  we had federal net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes of approximately million and  respectively 
these losses may be carried forward for years and will begin to expire in state net operating loss carryforwards at december  and were million and million  respectively 
state net operating loss carryforwards vary as to carryforward period and will begin 
table of contents to expire in  depending upon the jurisdiction where applied 
at december  and  a valuation allowance of  and  respectively  was established for state net operating loss carryforwards in states where utilization is uncertain due to lack of forecasted future operations 
based upon results and forecasted future operations  we believe it is more likely than not that the remaining amounts will be realized 
the company s through us federal income and and employment tax returns are currently under examination by the irs 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits could be materially different than that which is reflected in our tax provisions and accruals 
liquidity and capital resources our operations have historically generated sufficient cash flow to meet our requirements for debt service and equipment expenditures excluding major business and asset acquisitions 
cash flow provided by operating activities was million  million and million during  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in compared to was primarily due to the improvement in timing of accounts receivable collections in this resulted in lower accounts receivable balances which has been continued throughout the decrease in compared to was primarily due to the decrease in rig utilization in our cash flow from operations primarily was used to invest in new machinery and equipment as well as for capitalized upgrades to our fleet 
during  and  cash used in investing activities totaled million  million and million  respectively 
for the year ended december   our cash flow from financing activities was million  consisting primarily of the million increase in our net borrowings on our revolving credit and security agreement and other debt 
cash flow used in financing activities was million for in june  the company completed a public offering consisting of million shares of newly issued common stock at a price of per share 
proceeds to the company  net of underwriting discounts and other fees and expenses  were million and were used to repay indebtedness outstanding under the company s revolving credit facility 
in june  we used million in borrowings on our credit facility to pay off certain notes payable for equipment with interest rates higher than the revolving credit facility 
in addition  in january  we purchased  shares of common stock for million under a repurchase program 
for the year ended december   our cash flow from financing activities was million  consisting primarily of the million increase in our net borrowings on our revolving credit facility and other debt  and partially offset by million used for treasury stock purchases during the fourth quarter of we believe cash generated by our operations and our ability to borrow the currently unused portion of our revolving credit facility of approximately million  after reductions for approximately million outstanding letters of credit as of december   should allow us to meet our routine financial obligations for the foreseeable future 
sources of capital resources our rig fleet has grown from rigs in to marketed rigs at december  we have financed this growth with a combination of debt and equity financing  as well as operating cash flows 
at december   our total debt to total capital was approximately see note of the financial statements  included in
