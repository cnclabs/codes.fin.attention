item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in our annual report on form k for the year ended january  annual report 
all amounts are expressed in canadian dollars unless otherwise noted 
the following discussion includes forward looking statements that are not historical facts but reflect our current expectation regarding future results 
actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements because of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the matters discussed below 
please refer to risk factors included elsewhere in our annual report for a further description of risks and uncertainties affecting our business and financial results 
historical trends should not be taken as indicative of future operations and financial results 
our financial results are driven largely by changes in systemwide sales  which include restaurant level sales at both franchise and company operated restaurants 
as of january    or of our restaurants were franchised  representing in canada and in the united states 
the amount of systemwide sales affects our franchisee royalties and rental income  as well as our distribution income 
changes in systemwide sales are driven by changes in same store sales and changes in the number of restaurants and are ultimately driven by consumer demand 
average same store sales growth  one of the key metrics we use to assess our performance  provides information on growth in total systemwide sales at all restaurants  which have been operating for thirteen or more months  and provides a useful comparison between periods 
we believe systemwide sales and average same store sales growth provide meaningful information to investors concerning the size of our system  the overall health and financial performance of the system  and the strength of our brand and franchisee base  which ultimately impacts our consolidated and segmented financial performance 
franchise restaurant sales generally are not included in our consolidated financial statements except for certain non owned restaurants consolidated in accordance with applicable accounting rules  however  franchise restaurant sales result in royalties and rental income  which are included in our franchise revenues  and also generate distribution income 
we adopted this standard effective january  and retrospectively applied the standard to all fiscal years presented herein 
we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
however this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may also contain certain non gaap financial measures to assist readers in understanding the company s performance 
non gaap financial measures are measures that either exclude or include amounts that are not excluded or included in the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
where non gaap financial measures are used  we have provided the most directly comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with gaap and a reconciliation to gaap measures

executive overview we primarily franchise tim hortons restaurants in canada and the us as the franchisor  we collect royalty income from franchised restaurant sales 
our business model also includes controlling the real estate for the majority of our franchised restaurants 
as of january   we leased or owned the real estate for approximately of our system restaurants  which generates a recurring stream of rental income 
real estate that is not controlled by us is generally for non standard restaurants  including  for example  kiosks in offices  hospitals  colleges  and airports  as well as self serve kiosks located in gas and convenience locations and grocery stores 
we distribute coffee and other beverages  non perishable food  supplies  packaging and equipment to system restaurants in canada through our five distribution centres  and  in some cases  through third party 
table of contents distributors 
we supply frozen and some refrigerated products as well as paper and dry goods from our guelph facility to approximately of our ontario restaurants 
we are currently constructing a replacement distribution centre in kingston  ontario which is expected to serve more than restaurants in eastern ontario and quebec with dry goods  frozen and refrigerated products 
we anticipate the facility to be fully operational in the second half of in the us  we supply similar products to system restaurants through third party distributors 
in addition to our canadian and us franchising business  we have licensed locations in the republic of ireland and the united kingdom  which are mainly self serve kiosks operating primarily under the name tim hortons 
in keeping with our vertical integration initiatives  we also operate two coffee roasting facilities located in hamilton  ontario and rochester  new york and a fondant and fills manufacturing facility in oakville  ontario 
performance against targets the following table sets forth our actual performance as compared to our financial targets  as well as management s views on our performance relative to such targets measure target actual commentary average same store sales growth canada us average same store sales growth was driven by menu innovation  promotional programs  and operational strategies  such as our hospitality program  and pricing 
in addition  the core markets in our us business had strong same store sales growth in the latter half of cold stone creamery continues to be a contributor to same store sales growth  but to a lesser extent than in adjusted operating income growth on a week basis see selected operating and financial highlights below for a breakdown of year over year operating income adjustments  which we believe provide a more meaningful comparison to our target as these items were not contemplated at the time the target was set 
strong same store sales growth in both canada and us was one of the primary drivers of our higher operational performance  primarily in our rent and royalties and our distribution operations  and contributed to the company exceeding its key growth targets for effective tax rate approximately our original target did not include the lower effective tax rate that resulted from the sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries  which positively impacted our effective tax rate by approximately 
partially offsetting the decrease in our effective tax rate was the negative impact of approximately resulting from the asset impairment and related restaurant closure costs in the new england region 

table of contents measure target actual commentary restaurant development canada us restaurants restaurants restaurants restaurants canada and us new restaurant development  including self serve kiosk locations  was within the targeted range 
included in our new restaurant development were and new self serve kiosks in canada and us  respectively 
also included were new cold stone creamery co branded restaurants in canada  in us in addition  we converted and existing tim hortons locations in canada and the us  respectively  to include cold stone creamery 
capital expenditures million million capital expenditures were lower than the targeted range primarily due to changes in restaurant development formats and higher amount of capital leases versus purchases within our restaurant development 
we entered into million of capital lease obligations in earnings per share fully diluted per share the factors noted above that impacted our operating income also impacted our diluted earnings per share eps target  including the unanticipated gain on sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries  partially offset by our million allocation to restaurant owners  which  net of tax  impacted eps growth by approximately per share 
as planned  eps growth also benefited from fewer shares outstanding in versus due to our share repurchase programs 
partially offsetting these increases were asset impairment and related closure costs recognized in the latter half of the year  and other net costs which reduced eps growth by approximately per share 
the gain on the sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries  our million allocation to restaurant owners  which was recorded as a reduction of sales on the consolidated statement of operations  as well as the asset impairment charge and costs associated with the decision to close restaurants in the new england region  were not contemplated as part of management s guidance for operating income growth  effective tax rate  or eps  as noted above and within selected operating and financial highlights 
the macro economic climate in north america improved throughout as compared to  which was characterized by persistently high unemployment levels and other pressures in the us and in certain canadian regions that have a larger manufacturing base  including ontario 
the improvement in economic conditions translated into increased systemwide sales for our business in fiscal while we are not immune from recessionary and inflationary impacts  historically  we have proven to be fairly resilient in canada during challenging economic times  and we continue to be well positioned  due in part  to our quality product offerings at reasonable prices 

table of contents we opened a total of restaurants which included self serve kiosks in fiscal compared to restaurants which included self serve kiosks in fiscal our restaurant development program is typically highest in the fourth quarter each year 
we execute our development activities prudently and only with what we believe to be the right opportunities 
in  we continued with the shift we began in  focusing our restaurant development towards smaller restaurants  with a higher mix of non standard units in canadian growth markets and core growth markets in the us  which are most developed  as well as strategic alliances and co branding opportunities 
we are also targeting urban and rural communities in canada as part of our broader development strategy  including evaluating new flexible restaurant designs tailored to urban and rural markets 
two major events that impacted our fiscal financial results were the sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries and our decision to close restaurants and self serve kiosks in our hartford and providence markets  as well as two restaurants in our portland market 
in april  we received notice from iaws group ltd  a subsidiary of aryzta ag  our partner under the maidstone bakeries joint venture maidstone bakeries  invoking the buy sell provisions of the joint venture agreement 
we decided to sell our interest in maidstone bakeries for gross cash proceeds of million 
due to aryzta s ability to potentially leverage available surplus capacity for other channels and the international nature of their tax structure  this facility represented greater economic value to aryzta than to tim hortons 
the all cash transaction closed on october  our supply obligations for products extend for donuts and timbits tm until early  and we have supply rights until late  at our option  allowing us sufficient flexibility to secure alternative means of supply  if necessary 
the results of maidstone bakeries were consolidated in our financial results in accordance with applicable accounting rules until october   at which point we were no longer required to consolidate their results 
due to the continuing business relationship that exists  maidstone bakeries did not qualify to be presented as discontinued operations 
in fiscal  maidstone bakeries contributed approximately million to our adjusted operating income attributable to tim hortons inc  million to our net income attributable to tim hortons inc  and per share attributable to tim hortons inc  representing our share of earnings for the ten month period prior to the sale fiscal maidstone bakeries contributed approximately million  million and per share to our adjusted operating income  net income  and diluted earnings per share attributable to tim hortons inc  respectively 
see selected operating and financial highlights for a gaap reconciliation of adjusted operating income attributable to tim hortons inc to operating income 
we have recorded a pre tax gain on sale of maidstone bakeries in the fourth quarter of of million  less approximately million which  for accounting purposes  has been deferred and will be amortized over the remaining term of the supply agreement 
during the third quarter of  an impairment review was initiated on our portland  providence and hartford markets in the new england region based on their same store sales growth and financial performance  which were continuing to fall below our expectations 
upon completion of this review  we determined that the future expected cash flows of these markets were insufficient to recover the carrying value of the long lived assets in these markets 
commensurate with this review  we decided to close restaurants and self serve kiosks in our hartford and providence markets in the fourth quarter of and two restaurants in our portland market 
the providence and hartford markets are among the most densely penetrated market areas in us by quick service restaurants  and we were not successful in expanding our customer base to the levels required for future profitability 
as a result  total asset impairment and related closure costs of million were recorded in our us operating segment in the latter half of these markets represent a relatively small portion of our overall system in the us  but historically had a disproportionately negative impact on earnings  average unit volumes and same store sales growth in the us segment 
average unit volumes for standard restaurants in the providence and hartford markets were approximately half of our other core markets in the us these restaurant closures will allow us to focus on and reinvest a portion of our savings from these closed restaurants into our core growth markets in the northeast and midwest us by increasing our advertising and marketing scale where the brand continues to demonstrate strengthening average unit volumes  cash flows and brand progression 
we expect this decision to contribute directly to operating income improvement in our us segment in operating income increased million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the gain on sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries of million  partially offset by our 
table of contents million allocation to restaurant owners 
the large gain was also offset  in part  by asset impairment and related closures costs of million 
exclusive of these factors  other significant contributors to operating income growth were higher revenues driven by continued same store sales growth in both canada and the us and an increase in the number of systemwide restaurants  resulting in higher royalty  rental and distribution income 
fiscal had weeks as compared to our fiscal year which had a rd week of operations 
this rd week impacted operating income growth by approximately 
partially offsetting these operating gains were higher general and administrative expenses and lower franchise fee income and  in we had a million gain from a land sale which did not recur in net income attributable to tim hortons inc increased million  or  compared to fiscal the increase in net income was primarily a result of the higher operating income  offset to a much lesser extent by higher net interest expense and higher income tax expense due to the sale of maidstone bakeries  albeit at a lower effective tax rate in the higher net interest expense was primarily driven by higher interest rates on long term debt  the early settlement of our interest rate swaps associated with the prepayment of our term debt that would otherwise have expired in february  and the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the portion of the term debt that was prepaid 
these impacts were partially offset by approximately million of tax related expenses incurred in in connection with our canadian public company reorganization  which did not recur in and contributed to the overall growth rate  as well as interest income earned on higher cash balances on hand during the fourth quarter of mainly due to the proceeds from the sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries 
fully diluted eps increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal in addition to the operating income gains and significant items noted above  the lower basic and diluted weighted average number of shares outstanding in fiscal  as a result of our share repurchase program  was another driver of higher eps in we generate substantial cash flows from operations and have historically self funded our growth requirements from internally generated cash flows 
we  therefore  decided to distribute approximately million of the approximately million in after tax proceeds from the sale of maidstone bakeries through the repurchase of common shares 
it is our intention  subject to regulatory approval and in parallel with our annual capital allocation process  to distribute the remaining net cash proceeds from the sale of maidstone bakeries of up to approximately million through an additional normal course issuer bid 
we expect the net proceeds to be distributed in their entirety through share repurchases by the end of the third quarter of  although we may terminate the program at any time  subject to compliance with regulatory requirements 
in addition  we have also allocated million related to the maidstone bakeries sale to support our key relationship with restaurant owners with the intent of helping to partially mitigate anticipated rising operating costs 

table of contents performance targets the following table sets forth our performance targets  as well as management s views on achieving such objectives see accompanying notes below measure target commentary same store sales growth canada us same store sales growth to be driven by daypart  marketing and menu opportunities  as well as our continued focus on our hospitality initiatives 
we plan to create menu and product innovation to expand our market share across various dayparts and product categories  responding to customer needs and trends 
we plan to place particular focus on morning and afternoon evening snacking dayparts  as well as extending lunch opportunities in the canadian segment 
in the us  we plan to test and roll out menu items that help differentiate our cafe and bake shop brand identity 
we also plan on leveraging our marketing strengths and advantages in canada  and significantly increase our marketing and advertising spend in us markets compared to historical contribution levels  and in particular in our core  more developed markets 
our full year targets incorporate the impact of adverse weather conditions in several of our major canadian and us markets  as well as minimal residual pricing in most canadian markets 
earnings per share fully diluted we are targeting eps growth  on a fully diluted basis  for to be within our long range aspirational target of excluding the impact of the disposition of our joint venture interest in maidstone bakeries and the us asset impairment and related closure costs 
our eps target includes us segment operating income of us million to us million 
effective tax rate approximately we expect to continue to realize benefits associated from the public company reorganization completed in restaurant development canada us restaurants restaurants our specific plans include continued active development of both standard and non standard restaurants in canadian growth markets  working to accelerate the time it takes to create critical mass for convenience and advertising scale in our most developed us markets  and complementing our standard restaurant development activity in both canada and the us with non standard formats and locations 
capital expenditures million to million includes increased new restaurant development in canada compared to historical levels  the commencement of increased development in us core markets  and the completion of our replacement distribution facility in kingston  ontario 
notes the operational objectives  financial outlook  and aspirational goals collectively  targets established for and longer term are based on the accounting  tax  and other legislative rules in place at the time the targets were issued and on the continuation of share repurchase programs relatively consistent with historical levels 
the 
table of contents impact of future changes in accounting  tax and or other legislative rules that may or may not become effective in fiscal  and or future years  changes to our share repurchase activities  and other matters not contemplated at the time the targets were established that could affect our business such as  for example  the impact of disposition of our joint venture interest in maidstone bakeries and other significant matters  were not included in the determination of these targets 
in addition  the targets are forward looking and are based on our expectations and outlook on  and shall be effective only as of  the date the targets were originally issued 
except as required by applicable securities laws  we do not intend to update these targets 
you should refer to the company s public filings for any reported updates 
these targets and our performance generally are subject to various risks and uncertainties and are based on certain underlying assumptions  set forth in item a 
risk factors of this annual report  which may impact future performance and our achievement of these targets 
for  our targets are based on expectations of a gradual  continued economic recovery in both canada and the us additional information on our financial outlook is included under item business in this annual report 
we recently announced that we have entered into a master license agreement mla  based primarily on a royalty model  with the apparel group fzco the apparel group based in dubai to develop up to multi format restaurants over five years  including approximately five in the mla includes markets in the gulf cooperation council gcc markets of united arab emirates  qatar  bahrain  kuwait and oman 
the business structure for the mla also includes an upfront license fee and a small percentage of sales to cover procurement and product supply services to the gcc 
we believe there is opportunity over the long term to explore international opportunities and seed the tim hortons brand in various markets outside of north america

adjusted operating income attributable to tim hortons inc and operating income attributable to tim hortons inc are non gaap measures see table below 
operating income attributable to tim hortons inc excludes operating income attributable to noncontrolling interests 
prior to the adoption of a new accounting 
table of contents standard at the beginning of the first quarter of  operating income was  for the most part  unaffected by noncontrolling interests  which is not the case post adoption 
this new accounting standard requires the consolidation of variable interest entities of which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary  including maidstone bakeries up to the date of sale on october   as well as  on average  approximately to non owned restaurants from fiscal to previously  we did not consolidate maidstone bakeries and we consolidated approximately non owned restaurants  on average  in accordance with the prior accounting standard 
management believes that operating income attributable to tim hortons inc provides important information for comparison purposes to prior periods and for purposes of evaluating the company s operating income performance without the effects of the new accounting standard 
adjusted operating income attributable to tim hortons inc excludes operating income attributable to noncontrolling interests  as described above  the gain on sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries  the million allocation to restaurant owners and other maidstone bakeries related operating income adjustments  and excludes asset impairment and related closure cost charges 
the closure of these new england restaurants impacted three us operating markets  which represents approximately of our overall systemwide restaurants 
in addition  we have adjusted operating income for for the rd week of operations and for months of maidstone bakeries operating income so that year over year results are on a comparable basis 
we have excluded these items as we consider them to have a disproportionate impact on the overall performance of our consolidated business 
they also distort the comparison of financial results year over year and therefore  the assessment of ongoing operational performance 
the presentation of these non gaap measures is made with operating income  the most directly comparable us gaap measure 
we present information excluding amounts related to the impacts described above  and set forth on the table below  as it is more reflective of the way we manage and measure our performance internally

table of contents our financial results are driven largely by changes in systemwide sales  which include restaurant level sales at both franchised and company operated restaurants  although approximately of our system is franchised 
franchise restaurant sales are reported to us by our franchisees 
franchise restaurant sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than approximately non owned restaurants  on average whose results of operations are consolidated with ours pursuant to variable interest entity accounting rules 
the amount of systemwide sales impacts our royalties and rental income  as well as our distribution income 
changes in systemwide sales are driven by changes in average same store sales and changes in the number of restaurants ie  historically the addition of new restaurants and are ultimately driven by consumer demand 
systemwide sales growth is determined using a constant exchange rate to exclude the effects of foreign currency translation 
us dollar sales are converted into canadian dollar amounts using the average exchange rate of the base year for the period covered 
systemwide sales growth excludes sales from our republic of ireland and united kingdom licensed locations as these locations operate on a significantly different business model compared to our north american operations 
average same store sales growth average same store sales  one of the key metrics we use to assess our performance  provides information on total retail sales at restaurants operating systemwide that have been operating for thirteen or more months ie  includes both franchised and company operated restaurants  and provides a useful comparison between periods 
our average same store sales growth is generally attributable to several key factors  including new product introductions  improvements in restaurant speed of service and other operational efficiencies  hospitality initiatives  more frequent customer visits  expansion into broader menu offerings  promotional activities  and pricing 
restaurant level price increases are primarily used to offset higher restaurant level costs on key items such as coffee  wheat  cooking oils and other commodities  labour  supplies  utilities and business expenses 
our primary commodity  coffee  has seen high double digit percentage increases in the past year  and while increases in our coffee supply costs have not been up as high as the overall markets  they are up significantly year over year  and there has been no relief in green coffee pricing in the first part of costs of producing baked goods have also been under pressure 
the most important input costs in our baked goods commodities basket  wheat and cooking oils  have also seen significant year over year increases 
we secured pricing on our sugar supply last year at much lower prices  however  which will help offset some of the pressure on baked goods ingredient costs 
as a result of these rising prices  we expect that certain regions and markets in canada will need to increase prices to consumers in to help offset some of these significant cost pressures  as we did in february on certain products in our us market 
across the us  prices on certain products  including coffee  increased approximately 
in  the us increased prices to consumers in may 
the majority of the canadian regions have minimum residual pricing remaining in the system in  prior to any new increases 
there can be no assurance that these price increases will result in an equivalent level of sales growth  which depends upon customers maintaining the frequency of their visits even with the new pricing 
in fiscal  canadian average same store sales increased over fiscal  which was our th consecutive annual increase in canada 
in the us  average same store sales measured in us currency increased in fiscal over fiscal  which represented our th consecutive annual increase 
product innovation is one of our focused strategies to drive same store sales growth  including innovation at breakfast as well as other dayparts 
marketing and promotional activities which were designed to drive same store sales growth contributed to our same store sales results in both canada and the us in fiscal  we had an active menu and product focused promotional program designed to reinforce value to our customers 
in addition  we rolled out our canadian hospitality program and continued our cold stone creamery co branding initiative  with same store sales benefiting from both of these initiatives 
our product offerings  promotional activity  and operational efficiencies led to transaction growth in price increases in the front half of the year in canada and in the latter half of the year in the us also helped contribute to a higher average cheque

historical average same store sales increase st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter year canada us canada us year average indicates fiscal years that had weeks  for calculation of same store sales increase  the comparative base also includes weeks 
new restaurant development opening restaurants in new and existing markets in canada and the us has been a significant contributor to our growth 
below is a summary of restaurant openings and closures for our   and fiscal years fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year full serve standard and non standard self serve kiosks total full serve standard and non standard self serve kiosks total full serve standard and non standard self serve kiosks total canada restaurants opened restaurants closed net change us restaurants opened restaurants closed net change total company restaurants opened restaurants closed net change 
table of contents from the beginning of to the end of fiscal  we opened system restaurants including both franchised and company operated restaurants  net of restaurant closures 
typically  to system restaurants are closed annually  the majority of which are in canada 
restaurant closures generally result from an opportunity to acquire a better location  which will permit us to upgrade size and layout or add a drive thru 
restaurant closures made in the normal course typically occur at the end of a lease term or the end of the useful life of the principal asset 
we have also closed  and may continue to close  restaurants for which the restaurant location has performed below our expectations for an extended period of time  and or we believe that sales from the restaurant can be absorbed by surrounding restaurants 
in fiscal  we closed a total of system restaurants  including the closure of standard and self serve kiosks in our new england region 
in  we closed a total of restaurants  the substantial majority being in canada 
in  we closed a total of restaurants  which included the closure of restaurants in the fourth quarter of in new england one additional restaurant was closed by february   for a total of closures in southern new england 
new england closures were outside of the normal course of operations  arising from strategic profitability reviews of our us operations 
these closures  therefore  triggered impairment reviews  ultimately resulting in impairment charges and related closure costs in fiscal and included in our fiscal us restaurant openings were self serve kiosks nil in and in primarily located within tops friendly market stores as part of our continued strategic alliance 
self serve kiosk locations have significantly different economics than our standard and non standard restaurants  including substantially less capital investment  as well as significantly lower sales and  therefore  lower associated royalties and distribution income  however  such kiosks serve to increase our brand awareness and create another outlet to drive convenience  which is important in our developing markets 
one of our strategic planning initiatives is to grow differently in ways we have not grown before 
initiatives in support of this strategy include the expansion of our cold stone creamery co branding concept 
in  we began to co brand certain us restaurants with cold stone creamery and  in the second half of  we expanded this initiative to canada 
in the fourth quarter of  we entered into two separate licensing arrangements with kahala franchise corp  the franchisor of the cold stone creamery brand 
the nature and purpose of the arrangements were to expand the parties co branding initiatives 
we have exclusive development rights in canada  and certain rights to use licenses within the us  in both cases to operate ice cream and frozen confections retail outlets 
as of january   we had co branded locations  including co branded locations in the us in tim hortons restaurants and in cold stone creamery locations and co branded locations in tim hortons restaurants in canada 
in addition  we have a few cold stone creamery locations that are operating on a limited term agreement  and we are testing some take home only formats inside our restaurants 
in addition to the cold stone creamery co branding initiative  we began testing new concept restaurants in certain us markets to differentiate our customer offering as a cafe and bake shop destination 
at the end of fiscal  we had four new concept restaurants opened in the us these restaurants will be utilized to test various new products  equipment and restaurant design features in support of our us strategic plan 
during  we plan to incorporate various restaurant design features  product offerings  and or equipment from these new concept restaurants into our new restaurant development and renovation programs 
the following table shows our restaurant count as of the end of fiscal  and and provides a breakdown of our company operated and franchised restaurants

the effect of these conversions to date has been slightly accretive to operating income 
we believe that  in the long term  this franchising strategy generally provides better overall profitability to the business 
initially  after conversion  we generally provided additional relief to the operator  and we have been required to consolidate some of these restaurants in accordance with variable interest entity accounting rules for consolidations  which changed effective for our first quarter of we consolidated approximately non owned restaurants  on average  under the previous accounting standard and  with the adoption of the new variable interest entities accounting standard  we are now consolidating  on average  approximately non owned restaurants in fiscal we adopted this standard with retroactive application to prior periods for comparability 
segment operating income loss systemwide sales and average same store sales growth is affected by the business and economic environments in canada and the us we manage and review financial results from canadian and us operations separately 
we  therefore  have determined the reportable segments for our business to be the geographic locations of canada and the us each segment includes all manufacturing and distribution operations that are located in their respective geographic locations 
we continue to manage the development of our international operations in the republic of ireland and the united kingdom  which consist primarily of branded  licensed self serve kiosk locations  corporately

we also co branded locations in with cold stone creamery  which contributed slightly to the segment s same store sales growth and contributed positively to our canadian franchise fee income 
in  we will continue our focus on driving same store sales  through menu and product innovation to expand our market share across various dayparts and product categories  with a particular focus on morning and afternoon evening snacking dayparts  as well as lunch 
we also plan on leveraging our marketing strengths and advantages and will continue to promote improvement in restaurant service levels through our hospitality program see item business business overview and objectives 
there is minimal residual pricing remaining in the system in  prior to any new increases

the distribution business also benefited from incremental income related to new products in our supply chain 
distribution is a critical element of our business model as it allows us to control costs to our franchisees and service our restaurants efficiently and effectively while contributing to our profitability 
also contributing to our canadian segment operating income growth was our new coffee roasting facility in hamilton  ontario  which began operations in the fourth quarter of partially offsetting this growth in segment operating income were higher general and administrative expenses  due largely to additional headcount required to support the growth of our business as well as investments in our hospitality and co branding strategies and lower franchise fee income primarily due to a shift in mix of restaurant type openings to a greater number of non standard restaurants with lower franchise fees 
our canadian segment operating income includes of operating income from our previously held bakery joint venture 
due to the sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries on october   the income in fiscal only included ten months of operations  as compared to twelve months in us in  our us segment had an operating loss of million  compared to operating income of million in the operating loss is entirely due to the asset impairment and closure costs recorded in the back half of relating to our underperforming restaurants in the new england region described below 
excluding the asset impairment and related closure costs  we would have more than doubled our operating income from fiscal in our us segment to million in fiscal this is a considerable improvement over the prior year  due  in large part  to same store sales growth of amid a continued challenging macro economic climate in many of our core markets in the us the closure of the underperforming restaurants also contributed to the improvement in the us segment operating income as they resulted in higher rents and royalties due to lower relief 
we plan on reinvesting a portion of our savings from these closed restaurants into our core us growth markets in northeast and midwest us in to increase our advertising and marketing scale and increase awareness of our brand 
in addition  as a result of rising commodity costs  including coffee  the us increased prices to consumers in february by approximately 
the us had previously increased pricing in may 
table of contents during the third quarter of  an impairment review was initiated related to our portland  providence and hartford markets in the new england region based on their same store sales growth and financial performance  which were continuing to underperform against expectations 
upon completion of this review  we determined that the future expected cash flows of these markets were insufficient to recover the carrying value of the long lived assets in these markets 
commensurate with this review  we decided to close restaurants and self serve kiosks in our hartford and providence markets and two restaurants in our portland market 
the providence and hartford markets are among the most densely penetrated market areas in us by quick service restaurants  and we were not successful in expanding our customer base to the levels required for future profitability 
as a result  total asset impairment and related closure costs of million were recorded in our us operating segment in the latter half of  comprised of million in an asset impairment charge and million in restaurant closure costs representing primarily lease commitment obligations 
we intend to settle the majority of these obligations  to the extent possible in  with the obligation being paid out in cash  as required 
these markets represent a relatively small portion of our overall system in the us  but have had a disproportionately negative impact on earnings  average unit volumes  and same store sales growth in the us segment 
average unit volumes for standard restaurants in the providence and hartford markets were approximately half of other core markets in the us while we expect the decision to close the underperforming restaurants will contribute directly to earnings improvement  primarily through reduced depreciation and lower franchise relief provided to support these underperforming restaurants  in the us segment throughout  we will be redeploying a portion of these savings into advertising programs in our other core markets as described above  which we expect will help drive sales improvements 
our us segment operating income may continue to show volatility  quarter to quarter and year to year  as we expand our new unit growth 
when we enter new markets  average unit sales volumes for our franchisees may be lower than sales levels in our more established markets 
in addition  based on past experience  as we add new restaurants in developing markets  average unit sales growth for existing restaurants may be affected for a period of time until awareness of the brand improves and the market adjusts to the added convenience that new locations provide 
in certain situations  we provide relief of rents and royalties  and in some cases  relief for other operating costs  for a period of time to support these franchisees 
such relief offsets our rent and royalty revenues 
in developing markets  when we transition a restaurant from a company operated restaurant to either a full franchised restaurant or a restaurant governed by an operator agreement  we also generally provide relief to the franchisee for an initial period 
we are typically able to identify franchisees for new restaurants  but in certain developing markets  it may be more challenging  however  it has not historically been a major impediment to our growth 
despite the current economic climate and credit conditions  our franchisees continue to have access to lending programs with third party lenders  although processing may take longer and costs may be higher  consistent with prevailing market conditions 
we continue to experience a higher number of past due notes under our franchise incentive program with approximately of the notes past due as of january  in many cases  we have also chosen to hold the note for longer periods of time than we have historically done to ensure the restaurant has achieved certain profitability targets 
in the event a franchisee cannot repay the note  we will take back ownership of the restaurant and equipment  which effectively collateralizes the note and  therefore  minimizes our risk 
in addition  we are also entering into operator agreements more frequently than full franchise agreements when opening new restaurants  and once the restaurant is established and reaches certain profitability measures  we may sell the restaurant to the operator under a full franchise agreement 
we have also adapted our marketing and promotional activities to the challenging economic environment and related circumstances 
commencing in  a number of our competitors also commenced and or intensified discounting heightened by the continuing economic challenges in north america and combo or value pricing practices  as well as free product promotions 
this cross over of brands and menu offerings  and increased competition on price and other factors  continued through in  we continued to offer targeted value priced food and beverage programs  in addition to the launch of new products at a variety of everyday value price points  with the intent to strengthen and build on our price to value position and to enhance this 
table of contents message with our consumers in a tangible way 
in the us  we also introduced the use of coupons as a vehicle to attract new customers and introduce them to our brand and new product offerings 
while we do not intend to stray from our core everyday positioning of quality food at reasonable prices  we are working with our franchisees to communicate and interact with customers in a manner that responds to their current situation and the economic environment 
we believe that continued business refinements will help  over time  position our us business to defend aggressive competitive discounting activity  while also creating sales momentum 
during fiscal  we opened new restaurants  including self serve kiosks  and closed restaurants and self serve kiosks in the us  as compared to opening new restaurants and closing two restaurants  in fiscal the majority of the self serve openings in fiscal were part of an expansion of our strategic alliance with tops friendly markets and are located in tops stores in western and central new york  and northern pennsylvania 
although self serve kiosks contribute minimally to sales and operating earnings  they are one of the ways we seed our brand and offer convenience to our customers 
in  we plan to further prioritize us restaurant development capital spending among our core growth markets which are most developed 
our strategy is designed to increase our density in these core markets  and to accelerate the process to reach critical mass for both customer convenience and advertising scale 
while targeting a considerable increase in us segment operating income contribution in  we are also investing corporately in expanded brand development and marketing activities across our markets and  in particular  in these core growth markets during the upcoming year 
we also plan to test and roll out menu items that help differentiate our brand and offerings as a cafe and bake shop destination 
variable interest entities our variable interest entities income before income tax pertains to the entities that we are required to consolidate in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
these entities include maidstone bakeries  until the date of disposition of our ownership interest  and certain non owned restaurants 
in fiscal  our variable interest entities income before income tax was million as compared to million in fiscal  of which million and million relates to maidstone bakeries  respectively 
the year over year decrease in income from maidstone bakeries is due to only ten months of income consolidated in our fiscal results prior to selling our interest on october  we consolidated approximately restaurants on average in fiscal and  with a greater proportion representing us non owned consolidated restaurants as a result of the progression of us restaurants to our operator model versus company operated restaurants and increased participation in our franchise incentive program 
corporate charges corporate charges include certain overhead costs that are not allocated to individual business units and the impact of certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
corporate charges were million in fiscal and million in fiscal the million decrease primarily reflects the professional advisory and shareholder costs associated with our public company reorganization in that did not recur in  which amounted to million 
partially offsetting these lower costs were higher salary and benefit costs and higher professional fees related to other corporate initiatives including developing our international strategy 
the company  through a wholly owned irish subsidiary  has self serve kiosks and on a limited basis  some full serve kiosks in certain licensed locations within convenience stores in the republic of ireland and the united kingdom 
the self serve kiosks feature our premium coffee  tea  specialty hot beverages and a selection of donuts and muffins 
as of january   there were licensed locations in the republic of ireland and in the united kingdom 
these kiosks are operated by independent licensed retailers 
at present  the distribution of coffee and donuts through licensed locations with respect to these self serve kiosks is not a material contributor to our operating income  and therefore  is netted in corporate charges 
these arrangements have resulted in incremental distribution sales and royalties 
our financial arrangements for these self serve 
table of contents kiosks are different than our traditional franchise models  and we may not  therefore  collect similar data or include these locations in certain of our metrics  including systemwide and same store sales growth 
we recently announced that we have entered into a master license agreement with apparel group to develop up to multi format restaurants in markets in the gcc 
our top priority continues to be growing our canadian and us businesses 
we will manage this expansion corporately 
operating income from our international operations  which currently are insignificant  will continue to be included in corporate charges in our segmented operating results 
in  we expect to invest million to million  net of royalties  license fees and other costs  to support apparel group s investments to launch the business in our gcc market entry 
fiscal compared to fiscal segment operating income increased million  or  in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal  and  as a percentage of total revenues  was and  respectively 
included in our segment operating income were asset impairment and related closure cost charges of million that were recorded in our us segment 
excluding the asset impairment and related closure costs  segment operating income would have increased million  or 
fiscal includes a rd week of operations whereas fiscal only had weeks of operations 
the rd week increased segment revenues and reportable segment operating income growth rates by approximately and  respectively 
canada our canadian segment operating income increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to systemwide sales increases and increased contribution from our distribution business 
canadian same store sales growth was in fiscal  including some pricing contributions 
in fiscal  we opened restaurants in canada and closed  compared to opening restaurants and closing in fiscal canadian systemwide sales growth drove higher rents and royalties income  as well as higher income from our distribution business 
the distribution business also benefited from incremental income related to new products in our supply chain 
distribution is a critical element of our business model as it allows us to control costs to our franchisees and service our restaurants efficiently and effectively while contributing to our profitability 
during  we supported our franchisees through the difficult economic conditions by not passing through certain cost increases to franchisees incurred in our distribution business 
partially offsetting this growth in segment operating income were lower franchise fee income  higher general and administrative expenses  due largely to additional headcount required to support the growth of our business 
us in fiscal  our us segment had operating income of million  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal  which exceeded our break even operating income target 
the significant improvement in our us segment operating loss was  in part  due to the million asset impairment and related closure costs recorded during the fourth quarter of see below 
excluding the asset impairment and related closure costs  our operating loss in the us segment would have been million 
therefore  the results compared to  excluding the impairment and related closure cost impacts  reflect a million improvement from the closure of the underperforming company operated restaurants  and the related asset impairment charge contributed to the improvement in the us segment operating income as they resulted in lower company operated restaurant losses and lower depreciation and rent expense  benefiting operating income by million 
in addition  lower general and administrative expense and contributions from vertical integration also positively impacted operating income 
the us operating segment income improvement also resulted from higher systemwide sales  which benefited distribution and rents and royalties income 
our co branding initiative with cold stone creamery contributed a significant portion of our sales growth  leading to rents and royalties revenues and  in some cases  lower relief provided to franchisees 
our core brand 
table of contents same store sales continued to be positive  excluding the impacts of co branding 
partially offsetting these improvements were additional relief provided to certain franchisees  particularly as we transitioned more company operated restaurants to franchisees or operator agreements  and lower franchise fee income 
in  we explored other complementary strategic development opportunities to grow the business  including our co branding initiative  our expansion into new york city utilizing unique restaurant formats  and the opening of restaurants on two us military bases 
we saw the benefits of these initiatives in our us systemwide sales results in these initiatives complement our core strategy of selectively developing full serve  standalone tim hortons locations in our core markets 
we also adapted our marketing and promotional activities to the challenging economic environment and related circumstances 
in  we continued to see a large amount of competitive discounting and  as a result  we targeted combo food programs at a variety of value price points  with the intent to strengthen and build on our price value position and enhance this message with us consumers 
we introduced the use of coupons as a vehicle to attract new customers and introduce them to our brand and new product offerings 
during fiscal  we opened new restaurants  and closed two restaurants in the us  as compared to opening new restaurants  including self serve kiosks  and closing restaurants  in fiscal the self serve openings included that were part of a strategic alliance with tops friendly markets and are located in tops stores in western and central new york  and northern pennsylvania 
we typically expect price increases in one or more regions during the course of the year  but there can be no assurance that price increases will result in an equivalent level of sales growth  which depends upon customer response to the new pricing  and levels of discretionary spending  and our promotional activities 
in  we did not implement any price increases given the challenging us economic environment 
additionally  in  we completed our initiative to transition most of our company operated restaurants to franchise or operator agreements 
this shift was part of our longer term strategy of having a primarily franchised system model  similar to our canadian operations 
at the end of  approximately of our us restaurants were franchised  compared to at the end of our historical experience indicates that franchised restaurants are more successful for the franchisee  and therefore us  over the long term 
while transitioning company restaurants to franchise or operator agreements usually results in an initial increase in franchisee relief  particularly in our newer markets  and may increase the number of restaurants that we are required to consolidate in accordance with applicable accounting rules  this increase in relief is typically less than the operating loss we would otherwise incur from operating the restaurants corporately 
as a result  for  there was a net slightly positive benefit to our us segment as a result of the completion of this initiative 
variable interest entities our variable interest entities income before income tax pertains to our previously held ownership in maidstone bakeries and certain non owned restaurants that we consolidate in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
our variable interest entities income before income tax was million in fiscal and million in fiscal included in this income was million and earned by maidstone bakeries with the difference representing income earned on an average of to non owned consolidated restaurants from fiscal to fiscal  respectively 
during  we had a gradual shift towards a greater proportion of us non owned consolidated restaurants as a result of the progression of us restaurants to an owner operator model  versus company operated restaurants 
corporate charges corporate charges include certain overhead costs that are not allocated to individual business units and the impact of certain foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
corporate charges were million in fiscal 
table of contents and million in fiscal the million increase primarily reflects the professional advisory and shareholder costs associated with our public company reorganization in  which amounted to million 
included in corporate charges was a management restructuring charge  net of savings  of million 
the company  through a wholly owned irish subsidiary  has self serve kiosks and on a limited basis  some full serve kiosks in certain licensed locations within convenience stores in the republic of ireland and the united kingdom

results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal below is a summary of comparative results of operations and a more detailed discussion of results for fiscal and financial definitions can be found immediately following liquidity and capital resources 
fiscal compared to fiscal change from prior year of revenues of revenues in thousands  except where noted revenues sales franchise revenues rents and royalties franchise fees total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales operating expenses franchise fee costs general and administrative expenses equity income asset impairment and related closure costs   n m other income  net total costs and expenses  net gain on sale of interest in maidstone bakeries n m operating income interest expense interest income income before income taxes income taxes net income net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to tim hortons inc 
table of contents n m the comparison is not meaningful 
rents and royalties revenues consist of i royalties  which typically range from to of gross franchise restaurant sales and ii rents  which consist of base and percentage rent in canada and percentage rent only in the us  and typically range from to of gross franchise restaurant sales 
franchise restaurant sales are reported to us by our franchisees 
franchise restaurant sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than approximately non owned restaurants  on average whose results of operations are consolidated with ours pursuant to applicable accounting rules 
franchise restaurant sales do  however  result in royalties and rental income  which are included in our franchise revenues  as well as distribution income 
the reported franchise restaurant sales including those consolidated pursuant to applicable accounting rules were fiscal years franchised restaurant sales canada in thousands of canadian dollars us in thousands of us dollars revenues sales our sales include distribution sales  sales from company operated restaurants  and sales from variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated pursuant to applicable accounting rules 
sales for fiscal increased million  or  over fiscal  to  million 
the increase in sales was primarily driven from our distribution business  however  partially offsetting the increase were lower sales from variable interest entities consolidated in accordance with applicable accounting rules and company operated restaurants 
also negatively impacting year over year sales growth is the million commitment made to restaurant owners which has been recorded as a reduction of sales 
fiscal also had the benefit of an additional week of sales from the inclusion of a rd week of operations  which impacted sales growth in by approximately 
distribution sales 
distribution sales increased million  or  from  million to  million 
new products managed through our supply chain  continued systemwide sales growth  product mix and higher commodity prices contributed to distribution sales growth 
new products managed through the supply chain  including some products from maidstone bakeries  represented approximately million in incremental sales and incremental corresponding costs see below 
systemwide sales growth  which reflects higher same store sales and sales from a higher number of restaurants  represented approximately million of total distribution sales growth 
product mix and pricing related primarily to higher prices for coffee and other commodities due to higher underlying costs also contributed to the sales increase 
distribution sales growth was negatively impacted by the million commitment to restaurant owners made in relation to the sale of maidstone bakeries in the fourth quarter of distribution sales growth was also negatively impacted by approximately due to the inclusion of a rd week of operations in fiscal  as well as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
distribution sales represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal compared to of our revenues in fiscal our revenue mix has shifted towards a higher proportion of distribution sales  due primarily to new products being managed through the supply chain  partially offset by lower sales from our variable interest entities 
sales as a percentage of total revenues were relatively consistent year over year at in fiscal as compared to in fiscal 
table of contents our distribution revenues are subject to changes related to the underlying costs of key commodities  such as coffee  sugar  etc 
underlying product costs can also be impacted by currency changes 
increases and decreases in product costs may be passed through to franchisees  resulting in higher or lower sales and higher or lower costs of sales from our distribution business 
in  we did not pass on all cost increases to our franchisees due to the weaker economic climate 
recently  the restaurant industry has experienced sharp increases across the board in the commodities basket 
our primary commodity  coffee  has seen significant increases in the past year 
other key commodities have also seen increases 
as a result of these increasing commodity costs  and with our goal to provide the restaurant owner with consistent  predictable pricing over longer periods of time and to secure a stable supply chain  we have extended our forward purchasing beyond our historical pattern of six months  and we now have coverage for our key commodities for the remainder of commodity cost increases will be passed on to our restaurant owners in these commodity cost changes may also impact margins as many of our products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up and this can  therefore  create volatility year over year 
company operated restaurants sales 
company operated restaurants sales decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal we operated on average restaurants in compared to company operated restaurants in  resulting in lower sales 
we ended with company operated restaurants in canada  and four in the us  representing in total approximately of total systemwide restaurants 
on occasion  we may open company operated restaurants when we enter new markets in the us  and we may also repurchase restaurants from existing franchisees  operate them corporately for a short period of time  and then refranchise these restaurants 
as such  company operated revenue is impacted by the timing of these events throughout the year and also the type of restaurant standard or non standard that we own 
variable interest entities sales 
variable interest entities sales include sales from the consolidation of our previously held interest in maidstone bakeries and from the consolidation of certain non owned restaurants in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
variable interest entities sales were million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline is mainly due a more significant proportion of output from maidstone bakeries being managed and billed through our supply chain 
in addition  the sale and de consolidation of maidstone bakeries in october resulting in only months of sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which had a full year of operations 
the majority of non owned restaurants that are consolidated operate either solely under an operator agreement or are franchised locations participating in our us franchise incentive program 
on average  we consolidated approximately non owned restaurants during fiscal and while the overall number of non owned consolidated restaurants has remained consistent  a greater proportion of us non owned restaurants are being consolidated as a result of the progression of us restaurants to the owner operator model from company operated restaurants noted previously 
these us locations have historically had lower sales and income than canadian non owned restaurants that were previously consolidated 
also contributing to the year over year sales decline is the impact of approximately from the inclusion of a rd week of operations in fiscal foreign exchange 
sales from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar decreased the value of reported sales by approximately in fiscal compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during fiscal franchise revenues rents and royalties 
revenues from rents and royalties were million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  over fiscal  ahead of fiscal systemwide sales growth of  unadjusted for currency 
systemwide sales growth was driven by higher same store sales and sales from new restaurants opened during the year  both of which result in higher royalty and rental revenues because both are typically based  in whole or part  on a percentage of restaurant sales 

table of contents rents and royalty growth was driven by overall systemwide sales growth and lower relief  partially offset by unfavourable foreign exchange 
both canada and the us excluding the effect of foreign exchange translation contributed to our growth in rents and royalties revenues largely in proportion to their overall share of systemwide sales 
continued same store sales growth provided million to our rents and royalties growth  while the addition of new full serve restaurants in the system and restaurants which have not yet been open for more than months year over year contributed approximately million 
relief  which was primarily all within our us operations  was lower in fiscal on a year to date basis as compared to fiscal  partially due to foreign exchange and lower relief provided  due mainly from one less week of operations in and  to a lesser extent  from the closure of restaurants in the new england region 
we believe this trend of less relief will continue in as we focus on our core growth markets in the northeast and midwest us and have the benefit of a full year of closures in new england 
as previously mentioned  we will be redeploying a portion of savings from new england closure into advertising spend in our other core markets as described above  which we expect will help drive sales improvements 
rents and royalties growth was negatively impacted by approximately due to an additional week of sales from the inclusion of a rd week in fiscal which we did not benefit from in fiscal franchise fees 
franchise fees include the sales revenue from initial equipment packages  as well as fees to cover costs and expenses related to establishing a franchisee s business 
in the us  we have a franchise incentive program fip whereby revenue and related costs from the sale of initial equipment packages are deferred until the franchise restaurant has exceeded and maintained certain sales volume levels and other recognition criteria 
this incentive program impacts the timing of revenue recognized on these franchise sales see the application of critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
franchise fees were million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in franchise fees year over year is primarily the result of adding co branded cold stone creamery locations either within existing or new tim hortons locations  mainly in canada 
partially offsetting this increase have been lower franchise fee revenues recognized under our u 
s franchise incentive program  and a change in restaurant mix to a higher number of non standard locations 
our non standard restaurants utilize a number of unique restaurant formats and attract lower franchise fees per unit than our typical standard format 
in fiscal  we opened a total of standard and non standard restaurants  excluding self serve kiosks  consistent with standard and non standard restaurants openings in non standard restaurants include full serve kiosks and locations in gas and convenience locations  hospitals  grocery stores  universities and office buildings 
in addition  we opened self serve kiosks in compared to three self serve kiosks in while self serve kiosks represented a disproportionate amount of overall unit growth in fiscal  they did not represent a significant portion of franchise fees as the franchise fees related to these units are significantly lower than franchise fees for full serve standard and non standard restaurants  due primarily to the size of the equipment package required 
additionally  we had fewer resales and replacements in  resulting in lower revenues 
a replacement restaurant refers to a site change that results in a rebuild generally within a one kilometer radius and typically generates a new franchise fee 
in addition  we may enter into operator agreements for new restaurant sales  as opposed to full franchise agreements 
the amount of franchise fee revenues and associated costs are significantly different for operator agreement arrangements as compared to full franchise sales as we retain ownership of the equipment package under operator agreement arrangements 
foreign exchange 
franchise revenues from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for purposes of reporting of our consolidated results 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar decreased the value of reported rents and royalties by approximately in compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during franchise fee revenues are not earned evenly throughout the year  and for the us business  depend largely on the revenue recognition criteria under the fip program  mentioned previously 
as a result  franchise fee revenues for fiscal were lower than the value that would have been reported had there not been a change in the foreign exchange rates in effect at the time these revenues were recognized 

table of contents total costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales was  million in fiscal  compared to  million in fiscal  representing an increase of million or 
cost of sales growth was driven by higher distribution cost of sales  but was partially offset by lower cost of sales from certain consolidated variable interest entities and lower company operated restaurant cost of sales 
the increase in cost of sales in fiscal was also reduced in comparative growth terms by approximately due to the extra week in operations in fiscal distribution cost of sales 
cost of sales from our distribution business was million  or higher year over year 
higher costs were primarily associated with new products being managed through our supply chain  including some products supplied by maidstone bakery  and continued systemwide sales growth along with changes in product mix and higher underlying product costs 
costs associated with sales of new products represented approximately million  while systemwide sales growth increased costs by approximately million due to continued same store sales growth and the higher number of system restaurants year over year 
in addition  changes in product mix and higher product costs represented million of the increase 
the increase in distribution cost of sales in fiscal was reduced by approximately due to the inclusion of a rd week in operations in  as well as fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
distribution cost of sales represented of our total costs and expenses excluding our gain on sale of maidstone bakeries and asset impairment and related closure costs in fiscal as compared to of our total costs and expenses in fiscal our cost of sales mix has shifted towards a higher proportion of distribution cost of sales due primarily to new products being managed through the supply chain and the cost increases noted above  but is partially offset by lower cost of sales from variable interest entities  and company operated restaurants 
our distribution costs are subject to changes related to the underlying costs of key commodities  such as coffee  sugar  etc 
underlying product costs can also be impacted by currency changes  as was the case this year 
increases and decreases in product costs are largely passed through to franchisees  resulting in higher or lower revenues and higher or lower costs of sales from our distribution business 
these changes may also impact margins as many of these products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up and can create volatility year over year 
see a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk commodity risks below 
in connection with the sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries we deferred million of the gain on the sale associated with the ongoing supply agreement 
the supply agreement covers our obligation to purchase donuts and timbits and extends to early and  at our option  rights can be extended to late the fair value liability of the supply agreement that was deferred is being amortized over the remaining term of the obligation to purchase until early 
approximately million was amortized and recognized as a reduction in distribution cost of sales in fiscal approximately million will be amortized in and  million in  million in  million in and million in company operated restaurants cost of sales 
cost of sales associated with company operated restaurants includes food  paper  labour and occupancy costs  and varies with the average number and mix eg  size  location  and standard or non standard of company operated restaurants 
these costs decreased by million in fiscal from million in fiscal to million as a result of six fewer company operated restaurants  on average  during the year 
variable interest entities cost of sales 
cost of sales during compared to declined million year over year primarily due to a more significant proportion of our output from maidstone bakeries being managed and billed through our supply chain 
the offset to this decline is reflected in our distribution cost of sales  as described above 
in addition  the sale and de consolidation of maidstone bakeries in the latter half of 
table of contents further reduced cost of sales year over year 
we also experienced a change in mix of non owned restaurants  which for continued to include a greater proportion of us restaurants  which contribute less to variable interest entities cost of sales and income than previously consolidated canadian non owned restaurants 
on average  we consolidated approximately non owned restaurants under applicable accounting standards during fiscal and also contributing to the decline is approximately of higher costs of sales due to the inclusion of a rd week in foreign exchange 
cost of sales from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar decreased the value of reported costs of sales by approximately in fiscal compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during fiscal operating expenses total operating expenses  representing primarily rent expense  depreciation and property costs  increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal operating expenses growth was driven by higher rent expense  primarily as a result of additional properties that were leased and then subleased to franchisees and higher percentage rent on certain properties resulting from increased restaurant sales 
depreciation expense was also higher as the total number of properties we either own or lease and then subleased to franchisees increased to  in from  in the rd week of operations in lowered operating expense growth by approximately 
operating expenses from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar decreased the value of reported operating expenses by approximately in fiscal compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during fiscal franchise fee costs franchise fee costs include costs of equipment sold to franchisees as part of the commencement of their restaurant business  including the introduction of our co branding initiatives into existing locations  as well as training and other costs necessary to ensure a successful restaurant opening 
franchise fee costs increased million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal these higher costs were due to the addition of cold stone creamery co branded locations in canada and in us  higher support costs and expenses associated with establishing a franchisee s business  and amortization expense related to the intangible asset associated with our exclusive development rights for cold stone creamery in canada 
partially offsetting these higher costs were a lower number of us franchise sales recognized under the fip and  therefore  lower franchise fee costs and expenses recognized 
franchise fee costs from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting our consolidated results 
franchise fee costs are not incurred evenly throughout the year and  for the us  depend largely on the revenue recognition criteria mentioned previously 
franchise fee costs for fiscal were lower than the value that would have been reported had there not been a change in the foreign exchange rates in effect at the time these costs were recognized 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support current operations and provide the infrastructure to support future growth 
in general  our objective is for general and administrative expense growth not to exceed systemwide sales growth 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses for fiscal included million related to various professional advisory and project related fees incurred to support our long term international and other strategic initiatives planning  hospitality and co branding initiatives  as well as fees associated with our sale of maidstone bakeries 
in addition  we incurred higher salary and benefits to support the growth of our business  increased spending related to promotional activities  higher shareholder communication costs and higher depreciation 
stock based compensation increased salary and benefits by million  which was directly attributable to the increase in our share price 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal more than offset the million related to professional advisory fees  shareholder related transaction costs  and filing fees associated with our reorganization as a canadian public company in  which did not recur in the additional week of operations in fiscal impacted  and partially offset  the year over year increase in general and administrative expenses by approximately 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses remained flat at in both fiscal and fiscal there can be quarterly fluctuations in general and administrative expenses due to timing of recurring events or the impact of significant  corporate wide initiatives intended to deliver long term shareholder value

the strengthening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar decreased the value of reported general and administrative expenses by approximately in fiscal compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during fiscal equity income equity income relates to income from equity investments in joint ventures and other investments over which we exercise significant influence but which do not meet the consolidation requirements under applicable accounting rules 
our most significant equity investment is our interest in timwen partnership  which leases canadian tim hortons wendy s combination restaurants to owners or operators 
equity income in fiscal was million compared to million in fiscal  representing an increase of million 
equity income from our timwen partnership is not expected to grow significantly as we are unlikely to add any new properties to this venture in the future 
asset impairment and related closure costs in  asset impairment and related closure cost charges of million were recorded in our us operating segment in the latter half of based on our decision to close restaurants and self serve kiosks in the new england region and two restaurants in our portland market 
other income  net other income  net  includes amounts that are not directly derived from our primary businesses 
this includes gains and losses on asset sales  other asset write offs  and foreign exchange gains and losses 
in fiscal  other income  net  was million versus million in fiscal the million decrease was primarily the result of a million gain on the sale of a property in which did not recur in interest expense total interest expense  including interest on our senior notes see liquidity and capital resources overview and our credit facilities and capital leases  was million in fiscal and million in 
table of contents fiscal  representing an increase of million 
higher interest expense is primarily related to a higher weighted average interest rate on our long term debt  and includes million in settlement losses arising from the early termination and settlement of million of interest rate swaps in fiscal these settlements resulted from our prepayment of our million term loan which would have matured on february in addition  interest from additional capital leases contributed million to higher interest expense 
our senior notes  which were issued in the second quarter of  and a subsequent reissue in the same series in the fourth quarter of  have a fixed interest rate over seven years  whereas our long term debt that was retired had a higher variable component  which resulted in lower rates historically 
interest income interest income is comprised of interest earned from our cash and cash equivalents as well as imputed interest on our fip and other notes receivable 
interest income was million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase of million was a result of higher interest rates in canada and higher cash balances due to proceeds received from the sale of maidstone bakeries  partially offset by a reduction in interest earned from our fip and other programs 
income taxes total tax expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal our effective income tax rate in fiscal was compared to in fiscal our fiscal expected tax rate of was impacted positively by approximately resulting from the favourable tax treatment of the divestiture of our interest in maidstone bakeries  offset by the negative impact of approximately resulting from the us impairment charge and related restaurant closure costs 
the tax consequences of the maidstone bakeries divestiture resulted in the utilization of approximately million of foreign tax credits which were entirely offset by a valuation allowance 
given the nature of the maidstone bakeries divestiture  we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on remaining deferred tax assets in the us the fiscal effective tax rates were negatively impacted primarily by a tax charge resulting from our reorganization of the company as a canadian public company 
we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately in fiscal  although some volatility may be experienced between quarters 
the expected effective tax rate does not include the impact of any new tax matters such as unanticipated audit issues by taxation authorities or changes in tax law  rates or regulations in jurisdictions in which we operate 
there were revisions proposed to the us internal revenue code of  which would affect the federal income taxation of foreign earnings 
on august   president obama signed the education jobs and medicaid assistance act of that included certain revisions to these original proposals 
we had previously disclosed in connection with our public company reorganization  that the original proposals  which we referred to at the time as the obama proposals  if enacted  in whole or in part  may increase our effective tax rate by up to commencing in the year the proposals became effective 
management has determined that the proposals  as enacted  will not result in an increase in our effective tax rates 
the determination of income tax expense takes into consideration amounts that may be needed to cover exposure for open tax years 
for federal tax purposes  canadian and us tax jurisdictions remain open to examination for taxation years commencing in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the audit was completed for canada during fiscal and resulted in no material change in taxes 
the canada revenue agency is currently conducting an examination of various canadian subsidiaries of the company for fiscal and subsequent taxation years 
in fiscal  the internal revenue service completed its examination of the wendy s consolidated tax group which included tim hortons inc up to september  income tax returns filed with various provincial and state jurisdictions are generally open to examination for periods of three to five years subsequent to the filing of the respective return 
we do not currently expect any material impact on earnings to result from the resolution of matters related to open tax years  however  actual settlements may differ from amounts accrued 

table of contents the provisions of the tax sharing agreement with wendy s  as subsequently amended on november  the agreement  set forth the principles and responsibilities of wendy s and the company regarding the allocation of taxes  audits and other tax matters relating to periods when we were part of the same us federal consolidated or state and local combined tax filing group 
the agreement is applicable for all taxation periods up to september  either we or wendy s may be required to reimburse the other party for the use of tax attributes while we filed us consolidated or state and local combined returns  as a result of audits or similar proceedings giving rise to adjustments to previously filed returns  in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
for competent authority purposes only  two taxation years remain open to adjustment which could also result in payments to be made by one party to the other for the use of the other party s tax attributes 
also  disagreements concerning interpretation of the agreement or use of tax attributes in open and or closed years may occur  which  in accordance with the terms of the agreement  could result in arbitration and the payment by one party to the other for the use of the other party s tax attributes 
no payments have been made by either party to the other under the agreement during fiscal we have not recorded deferred taxes on undistributed earnings and other temporary differences of certain subsidiaries which are considered to be indefinitely reinvested 
if management s intentions with respect to these undistributed earnings and other temporary differences were to change in the future  deferred taxes may need to be provided that could materially impact our financial results 
net income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests relates to the minority interests arising from certain non owned restaurants we consolidate in accordance with applicable accounting rules and to the consolidation of our previously held interest in maidstone bakeries 
as a result of the sale of our interest in the bakery facility  we will no longer be consolidating the operations and net income of maidstone bakeries 
we consolidated on average restaurants in accordance with applicable accounting rules during fiscal and fiscal and consolidated maidstone bakeries until october  comprehensive income in fiscal  comprehensive income attributable to tim hortons inc was million compared to million in fiscal net income increased million in fiscal from fiscal  as discussed above 
other comprehensive income loss included a translation adjustment loss of million in fiscal  as compared to a translation adjustment loss of million in fiscal translation adjustment losses and gains arise primarily from the translation of our us net assets into our reporting currency  canadian dollars  at the period end rates 
the remainder of the year over year change in other comprehensive income loss is attributable to losses of million and related to cash flow hedges  net of taxes in fiscal and  respectively 
the exchange rates were cdn  cdn  and cdn for us on january   january   and december   respectively 
fiscal compared to fiscal we adopted a new accounting rule effective january   which resulted in the full consolidation of our previously held interest in maidstone bakeries and the consolidation of approximately additional non owned restaurants 
this accounting rule was applied retroactively and  as such  the results of operations for both fiscal and have been adjusted to reflect these changes

rents and royalties revenues consist of i royalties  which typically range from to of gross franchise restaurant sales and ii rents  which consist of base and percentage rent in canada and percentage rent only in the us  and typically range from to of gross franchise restaurant sales 
franchise restaurant sales are reported to us by our franchisees 
franchise restaurant sales are not included in our consolidated financial statements  other than approximately and non owned restaurants on average in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  whose results of operations are consolidated with ours pursuant to asc franchise restaurant sales do  however  result in royalties and rental income  which are included in our franchise revenues  as well as distribution income 
the reported franchise restaurant sales including those consolidated pursuant to asc were fiscal years franchised restaurant sales canada in thousands of canadian dollars us in thousands of us dollars 
table of contents revenues sales our sales include distribution sales  sales from company operated restaurants  and sales from variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated pursuant to asc sales during fiscal were  million compared to  million in fiscal  representing an increase of million  or  year over year 
sales growth was driven primarily by higher distribution sales and higher sales from variable interest entities  but was partially offset by lower company operated restaurant sales 
sales growth for fiscal as compared to fiscal was positively impacted by approximately due to an additional week of sales from the inclusion of a rd week of operations 
distribution sales 
distribution sales increased million  or  from  million to  million 
new products managed through our supply chain  continued systemwide sales growth  product mix  higher commodity prices  the inclusion of a rd week  and foreign exchange contributed to distribution sales growth 
new products managed through the supply chain represented approximately million in incremental sales and incremental corresponding costs see below 
systemwide sales growth  which reflects higher same store sales and sales from a higher number of restaurants  represented approximately million of total distribution sales growth 
product mix and pricing related primarily to higher prices for coffee and other commodities due to higher underlying costs also contributed to the sales increase 
we did not pass on all of these cost increases during fiscal  in order to help support our franchisees businesses and our customers during the challenging economic times of distribution sales growth over fiscal was also favourably impacted by approximately due to the inclusion of a rd week of operations  and foreign exchange also contributed positively to the growth 
distribution sales represented approximately of our total revenues in fiscal compared to of our revenues in fiscal our revenue mix has shifted towards a higher proportion of distribution sales  due primarily to new products being managed through the supply chain  with some offset by lower sales from company operated restaurants and variable interest entities 
as a result  sales as a percentage of total revenues was relatively consistent year over year at in and in company operated restaurants sales 
lower sales were mainly due to a decrease in the number of company operated restaurants in while there was an additional week of sales from the inclusion of a rd week in  the impact on company operated restaurant sales was not significant 
in  we operated  on average  company operated restaurants compared to company operated restaurants in  resulting in a million reduction in company operated restaurant sales year over year 
our company operated restaurant count decreased year over year as we focused on transitioning many of our company operated restaurants  particularly in the us  to either franchise or operator agreements 
in addition  we closed company operated restaurants in our southern new england markets  ten in the fourth quarter of and one early in the first quarter of we ended with company operated restaurants in canada  and in the us variable interest entities sales 
sales from the consolidation of variable interest entities increased  or million  from million in to million in the increase was primarily attributable to increased sales at our maidstone bakeries facility  however  the increase in sales is disproportionate to the increase in cost of sales experienced by the bakery see below 
the majority of non owned restaurants that are consolidated operate either under an operator agreement or are franchised locations  many of which are participating in our us franchise incentive program 
on average  we consolidated approximately to non owned restaurants during and while the overall number of non owned consolidated restaurants increased  we had a gradual shift towards a greater proportion of us non owned restaurants being consolidated as a result of the progression of us restaurants to the owner operator model from company operated restaurants noted above 
these us locations have historically had lower sales and income than canadian non owned restaurants that were previously consolidated 
sales from variable interest entities were favourably impacted by approximately due to the inclusion of a rd week of operations 

table of contents foreign exchange 
sales from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results 
the weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar increased the value of reported sales by approximately in fiscal compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during fiscal franchise revenues rents and royalties 
revenues from rents and royalties increased million  or  in fiscal over  which was consistent with the fiscal systemwide sales growth of  unadjusted for currency 
systemwide sales growth was driven by higher same store sales and sales from new restaurants opened during the year  both of which result in higher royalty and rental revenues because both are typically based  in whole or part  on a percentage of restaurant sales 
rents and royalty growth was driven by overall systemwide sales growth  partially offset by additional relief provided to certain franchisees in us markets 
in addition  the transition of company operated restaurants to either franchises or operator agreements contributed to the growth in rents and royalties revenues 
higher relief in  which was all in our us operations  was primarily related to either restaurants that were open for less than twenty four months or restaurants that were previously operated as company restaurants and transitioned to the owner operator model 
during  both canada and the us excluding the effect of foreign exchange translation contributed to our growth in rents and royalties revenues  largely in proportion to their overall share of systemwide sales 
continued same store sales growth provided million to our rents and royalties growth  while the addition of new full serve restaurants in the system year over year contributed approximately million 
rents and royalties growth was positively impacted by approximately due to an additional week of sales from the inclusion of a rd week  and foreign exchange contributed to the growth rates in franchise fees 
franchise fees include the sales revenue from initial equipment packages  as well as fees to cover costs and expenses related to establishing a franchisee s business 
in the us  we have a franchise incentive program fip whereby revenue and related costs from the sale of initial equipment packages are deferred until the franchise restaurant has exceeded and maintained certain sales volume levels and other recognition criteria 
this incentive program impacts the timing of revenue recognized on these franchise sales see the application of critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
franchise fees were million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decline in franchise fees year over year is primarily the result of fewer units sold and a change in restaurant mix to greater non standard locations 
our non standard restaurants utilize a number of unique restaurant formats and resulted in lower franchise fees per unit than our typical non standard format 
partially offsetting this decline in revenue were higher revenues recognized under our fip in the us in  we opened a total of standard and non standard restaurants  excluding self serve kiosks  compared to standard and non standard restaurants openings in non standard restaurants include kiosks and locations in gas and convenience locations  hospitals  grocery stores  universities and office buildings 
in addition  we opened self serve kiosks in compared to self serve kiosks in while self serve kiosks represented a disproportionate amount of overall unit growth in fiscal  they did not represent a significant portion of franchise fees as the franchise fees related to these units are significantly lower than franchise fees for full serve standard and non standard restaurants  due primarily to the size of the equipment package required 
additionally  lower revenues from resales and replacements were due primarily to a lower number of resales and replacements in a replacement restaurant refers to a site change that results in a rebuild generally within a one kilometer radius and typically generates a new franchise fee 
in addition  we may enter into operator agreements for new restaurant sales  as opposed to full franchise agreements 
the amount of

franchise revenues from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for purposes of reporting of our consolidated results 
the weakening of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar increased the value of reported rents and royalties by approximately in compared to the value that would have been reported had there been no exchange rate movement during franchise fee revenues are not earned evenly throughout the year  and for the us business  depend largely on the revenue recognition criteria under the fip program  mentioned previously 
as a result  franchise fee revenues for fiscal were higher than the value that would have been reported had there not been a change in the foreign exchange rates in effect at the time these revenues were recognized 
total costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales was  million in fiscal  compared to  million in fiscal  representing an increase of million or 
cost of sales growth was driven by higher distribution cost of sales and higher cost of sales from our consolidated variable interest entities  but was partially offset by lower company operated restaurant cost of sales 
the extra week of operations  due to the inclusion of a rd week in fiscal  increased cost of sales by approximately distribution cost of sales 
cost of sales from our distribution business was million  or higher year over year 
higher costs were primarily associated with new products being managed through our supply chain  and continued systemwide sales growth along with changes in product mix and higher underlying product costs 
costs associated with sales of new products represented approximately million  while systemwide sales growth increased costs by approximately million due to continued same store sales growth and the higher number of system restaurants year over year 
in addition  changes in product mix and higher product costs represented million of the increase 
distribution cost of sales was higher by approximately compared to fiscal due to the inclusion of a rd week  and foreign exchange accounted for the remainder of cost of sales growth increase 
the rate of growth in distribution cost of sales in fiscal was higher than the corresponding rate of growth in distribution sales in fiscal due primarily to higher product costs  including increases in underlying commodity costs such as coffee and sugar and the impact of foreign currency fluctuations  most of which but not all were passed on to franchisees 
distribution cost of sales represented of our total costs and expenses in fiscal as compared to of our total costs and expenses in fiscal excluding the asset impairment and related closure costs 
our cost of sales mix has shifted towards a higher proportion of distribution cost of sales due primarily to new products being managed through the supply chain and the cost increases noted above some of which were not fully passed on to franchisees  but is somewhat offset by lower cost of sales from fewer company operated restaurants 
company operated restaurants cost of sales 
cost of sales associated with company operated restaurants includes food  paper  labour and occupancy costs  and varies with the average number and mix eg  size  location  and standard or non standard of company operated restaurants 
these costs decreased by million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a result of fewer company operated restaurants  on average  during the year 
variable interest entities cost of sales 
cost of sales increased million year over year due in large part to higher commodity cost pressures experienced by our previously consolidated bakery facility 
maidstone 
table of contents bakeries produces bakery products  which do not necessarily have the same growth rates as total systemwide sales 
in fiscal  commodity cost increases at the bakery were not passed on to our franchisees 
this was one way we helped to support our franchisees businesses and customers during these challenging economic times 
the inclusion of a rd week also resulted in approximately of higher costs of sales 
in addition  we consolidated  on average  approximately to non owned restaurants under asc during fiscal and however  we had a gradual shift towards a greater proportion of certain us non owned restaurants requiring consolidation  which historically have lower costs per restaurant than certain canadian non owned restaurants 
foreign exchange 
cost of sales from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting of our consolidated results

operating expenses growth was driven by higher rent expense  primarily as a result of additional properties that were leased and then subleased to franchisees and higher percentage rent on certain properties resulting from increased restaurant sales 
depreciation expense was also higher as the total number of properties we either own or lease and then subleased to franchisees increased to in from  in in addition  operating expenses were higher by approximately due to the inclusion of a rd week

franchise fee costs declined million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal costs declined primarily due to a fewer number of standard restaurant openings  fewer resales and replacements and a higher number of restaurants opened as operator agreements versus full franchise agreements  which results in lower costs and associated revenues 
partially offsetting these lower costs were a higher number of us franchise sales recognized under the fip resulting in recognition of the associated costs  and  higher support costs  generally associated with establishing and or developing our franchised restaurants 
franchise fee costs from our us segment are denominated in us dollars and translated into canadian dollars for reporting our consolidated results

liquidity and capital resources overview our primary source of liquidity has historically been  and continues to be  cash generated from canadian operations which has  for the most part  self funded our operations  growth in new restaurants  capital expenditures  dividends  normal course share repurchases  acquisitions and investments 
our us operations have historically been a net user of cash given investment plans and stage of growth  and we expect this trend to continue through our senior bank facility senior bank facility was refinanced during the year and replaced with our revolving bank facility revolving bank facility  which provides an additional source of liquidity  if needed 
in fiscal  we generated million of cash from operations  as compared to cash generated from operations of million in fiscal  for a net increase of million see comparative cash flows below 
we believe that we will continue to generate adequate operating cash flows to fund both our capital expenditures and expected debt service requirements over the next twelve months 
if additional funds are needed 
table of contents for strategic initiatives or other corporate purposes beyond current availability under our revolving bank facility  we believe  with the strength of our balance sheet and our strong capital structure  we could borrow additional funds 
our ability to incur additional indebtedness will be limited by our financial and other covenants under our revolving bank facility 
our senior unsecured notes senior notes are not subject to any financial covenants  however  the senior notes contain certain other covenants  which are described below 
any such borrowings may result in an increase in our borrowing costs 
if such additional borrowings are significant  our credit rating may be downgraded  and it is possible that we would not be able to borrow on terms which are favourable to us 
we had an unsecured five year senior bank facility with a syndicate of canadian and us financial institutions that included a revolving facility of million and us million revolvers along with a million at inception term loan term debt  all of which were due to mature on february  in the second quarter of  we repaid million of the term debt  prior to maturity and without penalty 
in the fourth quarter of  we repaid the remaining million of the term debt prior to maturity and without penalty 
these prepayments were made primarily with net proceeds from the issuance of million of senior notes  coupon  series  due june  in addition  in the fourth quarter  we terminated our senior bank facility  and entered into a new million unsecured revolving credit facility that matures on december  see credit facilities below 
the senior notes were offered on a private placement basis in canada with a term of seven years  maturing june  in the second quarter of  we issued million of senior notes for net proceeds of the same 
in the fourth quarter of  we reopened the senior notes and issued an additional million for net proceeds of million  which included a premium of million 
the premium  along with the loss on the interest rate forwards of million see below and financing fees of approximately million  were deferred and are being amortized to interest expense over the term of the senior notes

the senior notes bear a fixed interest coupon rate of with interest payable in semi annual installments  in arrears  which commenced december  the senior notes rank equally and pari passu with each other and with the notes of every other series regardless of their actual time of issue issued under the trust indenture  and  with all other senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of tim hortons inc the borrower  including amounts owing under the revolving bank facility dated december  see below  except as to any sinking fund which pertains exclusively to any particular indebtedness of the borrower and statutory preferred exceptions 
the senior notes are initially guaranteed by the tdl group corp 
tdl  the borrower s largest canadian subsidiary 
for as long as the borrower s and tdl s third party revenues represent at least of the consolidated revenues of the company as tested quarterly  on a rolling twelve month basis  tdl will remain the sole guarantor 
to the extent combined third party revenues of these two entities is less than of consolidated revenues  additional guarantors must be added until of consolidated revenues are reached or exceeded 
in each case  the borrowers subsidiary with the highest gross revenue must be one of the guarantors 
alternatively  if the borrower s third party revenues reach or exceed of consolidated revenues  the guarantors will be released 
there are also certain covenants limiting liens to secure borrowed money subject to permitted exceptions and limiting our ability to undertake certain acquisitions and dispositions subject to compliance with certain requirements 
the senior notes are redeemable  at the borrower s option  at any time  upon not less than days notice  but no more than days notice  at a redemption price equal to the greater of i a price calculated to provide a yield to maturity from the redemption date equal to the yield on a non callable government of canada bond with a maturity equal to  or as close as possible to  the remaining term to maturity of the senior notes  plus and ii par  together  in each case  with accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date fixed for redemption 
in the event of a change of control and a resulting rating downgrade to below investment grade  the borrower will be required to make an offer to repurchase the senior notes at a redemption price of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to the date of redemption 

table of contents in march  we entered into interest rate forwards with a notional amount of million as a cash flow hedge to limit the interest rate volatility in the period prior to the issuance of the senior notes 
these interest rate forwards were settled in june  resulting in a loss of million of which million remains in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance sheet 
this loss is being recognized in interest expense over the seven year term of the senior notes as noted above 
in and  in connection with the term debt  we entered into interest rate swaps with a notional amount of million  which were used to fix a portion of the variable rate term debt at 
upon prepayment of the term debt  we also settled these interest rate swaps  resulting in a reclassification of million from other comprehensive loss to interest expense in when evaluating our leverage position  we look at metrics that consider the impact of long term operating and capital leases as well as other long term debt obligations 
we believe this provides a more meaningful measure of our leverage position given our significant investments in real estate 
at january   we had approximately million in long term debt and capital leases on our balance sheet 
we continue to believe that the strength of our balance sheet  including our cash position  provides us with opportunity and flexibility for future growth while still enabling us to return excess cash to our shareholders through a combination of our share repurchase program and dividends 
given the ongoing credit concerns in financial markets  we continue to be more focused on capital preservation than yield when investing cash 
we invest primarily in short term money market instruments of several large canadian financial institutions  thereby minimizing both our liquidity risk and counterparty risk associated with our cash and cash equivalents 
our primary liquidity and capital requirements are for new restaurant construction  renovations of existing restaurants  expansion of our business through vertical integration and general corporate needs 
in addition  we utilize cash to fund our dividends and share repurchase programs 
historically  our annual working capital needs have not been significant because of our focus on managing our working capital investment 
in each of the last five fiscal years  operating cash flows have funded our capital expenditure requirements for new restaurant development  remodeling  technology initiatives and other capital needs 
our strategic plan outlined key aspects of our business that we intend to focus on during the next four years 
leveraging significant levels of vertical integration and continuing to explore additional systemwide benefits through vertical integration was one of the key initiatives outlined in the more than a great brand strategic plan 
consistent with that plan  we are in the process of constructing a replacement distribution centre in kingston  ontario which will provide warehouse and distribution capability and capacity for frozen and refrigerated products in addition to dry goods  one stop shop  to our restaurant owners 
total planned capital expenditures on this facility are currently estimated to be approximately million  with approximately million incurred in fiscal capital expenditures on the kingston distribution centre are less than expected for  due to timing 
the facility is expected to be fully operational in the second half of and serve more than restaurants in eastern ontario and quebec  responding to continued projected growth in that market 
as with other vertical integration initiatives  we expect this new facility will deliver important system benefits  including improved efficiency and cost effective service for our restaurant owners  as well as providing a reasonable financial return for the company 
in  we expect to incur certain ramp up costs  primarily in the second and third quarters  that will have an impact on our distribution margins  however  the impact of these costs is included in our eps target 
distribution is a critical element of our business model as it allows us to control costs to our franchisees and service our restaurants efficiently and effectively while contributing to our profitability 
in fiscal  we continued to repurchase shares under our previously announced share repurchase program  which authorized the company to repurchase up to million of common shares  not to exceed the regulatory maximum of  shares  which was equivalent to of the company s outstanding common shares at the time of regulatory approval on february  the program  which received toronto stock exchange tsx approval on march  under tsx normal course issuer bid rules  commenced on march  and is due to end on march  in the third quarter  the sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries generated gross cash proceeds of million see executive overview 
we announced our plans to distribute approximately million of 
table of contents the approximately million in after tax proceeds from that sale to shareholders through increased share repurchases  and we obtained regulatory approval from the tsx to amend our share repurchase program to increase the maximum number of shares that may be purchased  effective november  under the amended program  we planned to spend the million originally contemplated  plus up to an additional million  with the final amount dependent upon average daily trading limits and share price  subject to the limitation that we cannot repurchase more than the regulatory maximum of  of our shares representing of our public float as of february   as defined under tsx rules 
the program will terminate on march   without the million maximum being reached as the share maximum under the agreement will have been achieved 
the maximum number of shares that could be purchased during any trading day under the amended program was the lesser of  common shares  representing of the average daily trading volume adtv on the tsx  based on the six completed calendar months ended january   and of the trading volume ie  the aggregate trading volume for the common shares on the tsx  nyse or other corporation approved published market as defined under the ontario securities act 
the of adtv limit  for which there are permitted exceptions  was determined in accordance with regulatory requirements in connection with the original implementation of the program  and the of trading volume was a limit we implemented voluntarily after consideration of trading volumes leading up to the date of the amendment 
under the amended program  shares were repurchased through a combination of a b  or automatic trading program  and through management s discretion  subject to regulatory requirements  market  cost  and other considerations 
in fiscal  we spent approximately million to purchase and cancel approximately million shares under our share repurchase programs at an average cost of per share 
as part of our annual capital allocation process  we considered our remaining net proceeds from the maidstone bakeries sale in conjunction with our plan to return capital to shareholders in as a result  our board of directors has approved a new share repurchase program program for up to million in common shares  not to exceed the regulatory maximum of  shares  representing of our public float as of february   as defined under tsx rules 
the program represents million in cash flow generation and cash on hand and  in addition  up to million from the remaining undistributed net proceeds from the maidstone bakeries sale in october the net proceeds of million from that sale  after taxes and the million allocated to restaurant owners  is expected to be distributed in its entirety by the end of the third quarter of we received regulatory approval for the program from the toronto stock exchange tsx on february  the program is planned to commence on march  and is due to terminate on march  under the terms  the program may terminate earlier than march  if the million maximum or regulatory maximum of  shares is reached or  at our discretion  subject to regulatory compliance 
there can be no assurance as to the precise number of shares or equivalent dollar value of shares that will be purchased under the program 
common shares will be purchased under the program through a combination of a b automatic trading plan as well as at management s discretion in compliance with regulatory requirements  and given market  cost and other considerations 
repurchases will be made on the tsx  the new york stock exchange  and or other canadian marketplaces  subject to compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
the maximum number of shares that may be purchased during any trading day may not exceed of the average daily trading volume on the tsx  excluding purchases made by us under our current normal course issuer bid  based on the previous six completed calendar months  for a daily total of  common shares 
this limit  for which there are permitted exceptions  is determined in accordance with regulatory requirements 
since initiation of these share repurchase programs  we have repurchased an aggregate of approximately million shares  or  of our outstanding common shares as of the date of inception of the first program  for a total cost of million 
separately  we spent million to acquire shares for the tdl rsu plan trust in discussed below 
we have primarily funded all of these repurchases to date from our cash on hand  including net proceeds from the sale of maidstone bakeries  and from our cash from operations 
our outstanding share capital is comprised of common shares 
an unlimited number of common shares  without par value  is authorized  and we had  common shares outstanding at january  as at 
table of contents this same date  we had issued options to acquire  of our common shares to officers of the corporation pursuant to our stock incentive plan  of which  were exercisable 
our board of directors approved a increase in the quarterly dividend to per common share in february in fiscal  we paid four quarterly dividends of per common share  totaling approximately million at this new rate 
in fiscal  we paid four quarterly dividends of per share  totaling approximately million 
we have historically paid for all dividends primarily from cash generated from our operations  and we expect to continue to do so in in  our board increased our long term  targeted dividend payout range to from of prior year  normalized annual net income attributable to tim hortons inc  which is net income attributable to tim hortons inc adjusted for certain discrete items  such as gains on divestitures  tax impacts and asset impairments  that affect our annual net income attributable to tim hortons inc in february  our board of directors approved an increase in the dividend from to per share paid quarterly  representing an increase of  reflecting our strong cash flow position  which allows us to continue our first priority of funding our business growth investment needs while still returning value to our shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases 
the board has declared the first quarterly dividend at the increased rate of per share  payable on march  to shareholders of record as of march  dividends are declared and paid in canadian dollars to all shareholders with canadian resident addresses 
for us resident shareholders  dividends paid will be converted to us dollars based on prevailing exchange rates at time of conversion by the clearing and depository services inc for beneficial shareholders and by us for registered shareholders 
notwithstanding our targeted payout range and the recent increase in our dividend  the declaration and payment of all future dividends remains subject to the discretion of our board of directors and the company s continued financial performance  debt covenant compliance  and other risk factors 
in  we established the tdl rsu plan trust 
the trust holds our common shares for future use to satisfy our obligation to settle restricted stock units rsus granted to certain canadian employees under our stock incentive plan by delivering common shares 
this trust enables us to fix the amount of cash required to satisfy rsu obligations that vest in a future period at approximately the same dollar value at which the rsus were originally granted 
in fiscal and  the trust purchased approximately  shares and  shares  respectively  of our common shares on the open market for a total cost of million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  the trust settled rsu obligations with the substantial majority of the company s canadian employees by disbursing  shares from the trust  with a total value of million  after provision for all applicable statutory withholding requirements on account of the employees 
in fiscal  prior to the corporate reorganization  rsu obligations to us employees and directors were settled with treasury shares 
as a canadian public company after the reorganization  we no longer have treasury shares and as a result  rsu obligations to us employees and certain other participants were settled by open market purchase  all of the foregoing after provision for all applicable statutory withholding requirements on the account of the respective employees 
credit facilities the senior bank facility was terminated in the fourth quarter of we now have an unsecured four year revolving bank facility  which is supported by a syndicate lending group of nine financial institutions  of which canadian financial institutions hold approximately of the total funding commitment 
the revolving bank facility matures on december  we will use the borrowings under the new revolving bank facility for general corporate purposes  including potential acquisitions and other business initiatives 
the revolving bank facility has the same guarantee structure as the senior notes and may be drawn by the borrower or tdl and as such  has a tim hortons inc guarantee that can not be released 
the revolving bank 
table of contents facility is for million which includes million overdraft availability and million letter of credit facility 
the revolving bank facility is undrawn  except for approximately million million under the revolvers to support standby letters of credit 
we also incur commitment fees  whether the facility is used or unused 
under the revolvers  the commitment fees varied according to the our leverage ratio  whereas under the revolving bank facility the commitment fees vary according to our credit rating on our senior notes and  as at january  and january   equaled and of the facility amount  respectively 
the revolving bank facility provides variable rate funding options including bankers acceptances or libor plus a margin 
if certain market conditions caused libor to be unascertainable or not reflective of the cost of funding  the administration agent under the facility can cause the borrowing to be at the base rate which has a floor of one month libor plus 
this facility does not carry a market disruption clause 
the revolving bank facility contains various covenants which  among other things  requires the maintenance of two financial ratios a consolidated maximum total debt coverage ratio  and  a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio 
we were in compliance with these covenants as at january  the consolidated maximum debt coverage ratio is computed as consolidated total debt divided by net income excluding net income of variable interest entities and before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and net of discrete non cash losses and gains or extraordinary losses and gains incurred outside the ordinary course of business the denominator 
consolidated total debt the numerator primarily includes without duplication all liabilities for borrowed money  capital lease obligations  letters of credit whether or not related to borrowed money  the net marked to market under swap agreements and guarantee liabilities excluding those scheduled in the agreement 
the minimum fixed charge coverage is computed as net income excluding net income of variable interest entities and before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  rent expense  and net of discrete non cash losses and gains or extraordinary losses and gains incurred outside the ordinary course of business  collectively as the numerator  divided by consolidated fixed charges 
consolidated fixed charges includes interest and rent expense 
the following table outlines the level of our covenant compliance for fiscal under the revolving bank facility actual required consolidated total debt to ebitda minimum fixed charge consolidated total debt to ebitda cannot exceed 
minimum fixed charge cannot be less than 
the revolving bank facility contains certain covenants that will limit our ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  create liens  merge with other entities  sell assets  make restricted payments  make certain investments  loans  advances  guarantees or acquisitions  change the nature of our business  enter into transactions with affiliates  or enter into certain restrictive agreements  or pay dividends or make share repurchases if we are not in compliance with the financial covenants  or if such transactions would cause us to not be in compliance with the financial covenants 
events of default under the revolving bank facility include a default in the payment of the obligations under the revolving bank facility or a change in control of tim hortons inc additionally  events of default for the borrower  tdl or any future guarantor include a breach of any representation  warranty or covenant under the revolving bank facility  certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or liquidation  and  any payment default or acceleration of indebtedness if the total amount of such indebtedness unpaid or accelerated exceeds million 

table of contents comparative cash flows operating activities 
net cash provided from operating activities increased million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal operating cash flow growth in fiscal had higher net income attributable to tim hortons inc of million which included an accounting gain on sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries of million and a non cash asset impairment of million and the associated tax effects 
changes in operating assets and liabilities were mainly attributable to our million allocation to restaurant owners  restaurant closure costs and other liabilities outstanding at year end and was partially offset by an increase in inventories and other 
higher depreciation expense and higher stock based compensation expense of million and million  respectively  also contributed to higher net cash provided by operating activities 
deferred income taxes decreased by million 
included in deferred tax expense in fiscal was approximately million relating to the uncertainty of realizing deferred tax assets relating to us operations in connection with the public company reorganization 
the higher fiscal depreciation expense primarily reflects depreciation expense from new restaurant development in late and fiscal and a full year s depreciation related to our new coffee roasting facility which became fully operational in the latter half of investing activities 
net cash provided from investing activities in fiscal was million compared to a net cash use of million in fiscal  representing an increase in cash from investing activities of million 
the higher provision of cash was primarily a result of the gross proceeds received from the sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries of million  offset by million of cash and cash equivalents held by maidstone bakeries and deconsolidated at the time of sale 
also contributing to the increase in cash are lower capital expenditures of million year over year as we continue our focus on more capital efficient designs and locations and also leased a higher proportion of new restaurant development year over year 
in addition  we issued fewer notes receivable and received higher principal repayments of million on our notes receivable 
we spent million on capital expenditures in fiscal compared to million in fiscal capital expenditures are typically the largest ongoing component of our investing activities and include expenditures for new restaurants  improvements to existing restaurants  and other corporate capital needs 
a summary of capital expenditures for fiscal   and is as follows fiscal years in millions capital expenditures new restaurants restaurant replacements and renovations new coffee roasting facility new distribution facility other capital needs total capital expenditures 
table of contents capital expenditures were primarily for new restaurant development and remodeling mentioned above  as well as spending on our new distribution facility in kingston  ontario and other capital needs 
in addition  capital expenditures in fiscal included expenditures related to the completion of our new coffee roasting facility in hamilton  ontario 
expenditures for other capital needs typically represent software implementations and other equipment purchases required for ongoing business needs 
capital expenditures for new restaurants by operating segment were as follows fiscal years in millions canada us total we expect fiscal capital expenditures to be between million and million for new restaurant development  remodeling  technology initiatives and other capital needs  including the completion of our replacement distribution facility in kingston  ontario 
we anticipate these and future capital needs related to our normal business activities will be funded through ongoing operations 
financing activities 
financing activities used cash of million in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal our increased spending is primarily related to our share repurchase program see overview section 
we spent million more year over year on share repurchases in comparison to late in we began to deploy the proceeds from the sale of our interest in maidstone bakeries through our share repurchase program 
we intend to continue the deployment of these proceeds through our program with the intent to have proceeds fully deployed by the third quarter of we deferred repurchases during april through october until we completed a review of our capital allocation activities after our public company reorganization 
higher dividend payments of million in and principal payments on our long term debt obligations largely offset by the issuance of our senior notes also contributed to the higher spending

we purchase certain products in the normal course of business  the prices of which are affected by commodity prices 
included in the purchase obligations outlined above are commitments relating to the following commodities green coffee  sugar  palm soybean oil and wheat 
some of these purchase commitments are made on behalf of third party suppliers  including maidstone bakeries 
we generally purchase six to twelve months forward in these commodities  but in periods of rising prices  we may extend these purchase commitments for longer periods 
we employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility  including setting fixed prices with suppliers  setting in advance the price for products to be delivered in the future and unit pricing based on an average of commodity prices over the corresponding period of time 
in general  we do not have contracts with our suppliers of commodities that extend greater than twelve months 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   we have guaranteed certain leases and debt payments of franchisees amounting to approximately million 
in the event of default by a franchisee  we generally retain the right to acquire possession of the related restaurants 
we are also the guarantor on million in letters of credit and surety bonds with various parties  however  we do not expect any significant loss to result from these instruments because we do not believe performance will be required

the application of critical accounting policies we describe our significant accounting policies in note of our audited historical consolidated financial statements 
included in our significant accounting policies are certain policies that we believe are both significant and may require us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because we need to estimate the effect of inherently uncertain matters 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to make assumptions and estimates that can have a material impact on the results of our operations 
these assumptions and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
estimates and judgments are inherent in  but not limited to  the following the estimation of the collectibility of royalty and other franchise related revenue  legal obligations  income taxes  insurance liabilities  various other commitments and contingencies  valuations used when assessing potential impairment of assets and other intangibles  inventory valuations  gift certificate and cash card breakage  property and equipment  including the estimation of the useful lives of property and equipment and other long lived assets  estimates associated with restaurant closure costs  and  valuations associated with estimating stock based compensation expense 
while management applies its judgment based on assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time  actual results could vary from these assumptions or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate and update our assumptions and estimates based on new events occurring  additional information being obtained or more experience being acquired 
in the normal course of business  we must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which also requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
we may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process 
however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates  and adjustments to income could be required

intercompany accounts and transactions among consolidated entities have been eliminated upon consolidation 
investments in non consolidated affiliates over which we exercise significant influence  but for which we are not the primary beneficiary and do not have control  are accounted for using the equity method

other than the adoption of new accounting standards  there have been no significant changes in critical accounting policies or management estimates since the year ended january  effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 now codified within asc this statement amended interpretation r to require an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics i the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entity s economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
additionally  an enterprise is required to assess whether it has an implicit financial responsibility to ensure that a variable interest entity operates as designed when determining whether it has the power to direct the activities of the variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance 
this statement also amended interpretation r to focus on a more qualitative approach  rather than a quantitative approach previously required for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity  amended certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity  added an additional requirement to assess whether an entity is a variable interest entity  on an ongoing basis  and requires enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
see our condensed consolidated financial statements note variable interest entities for additional information regarding the impact of the adoption of this standard 
effective january   we adopted certain provisions within accounting standard update asu no 
fair value measurements improving disclosures about fair value measurements  as codified in asc fair value measurements 
this asu provides amendments to fair value measurements that requires more enhanced disclosures about i the different classes of assets and liabilities measured at fair value  ii the valuation techniques and inputs used  iii the activity in level fair value measurements  and iv the transfers between levels  and fair value measurements 
this asu is effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for certain disclosures applicable to level fair value measurements which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those years 
we adopted all elements of this update  and it did not have a significant impact on our financial statements or related disclosures 
effective june   we adopted asu no 
scope exception related to embedded credit derivatives  as codified in asc derivatives and hedging 
this asu clarifies the type of embedded credit derivative that is exempt from embedded derivative bifurcation requirements 
only one form of embedded credit derivative qualifies for the exemption one that is related only to the subordination of one financial instrument to another 
as a result  entities that have contracts containing an embedded credit derivative feature in a form other than such subordination may need to separately account for the embedded credit derivative feature 
this asu was effective for interim periods beginning after june  the adoption of this update did not have a significant impact on our financial statements or related disclosures 
effective december   the company adopted asu no 
disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses as codified in asc receivables 

table of contents this update improves the disclosures that an entity provides about the credit quality of its financing receivables  excluding short term trade receivables  and the related allowance for credit losses 
as a result of these amendments  an entity is required to disaggregate by portfolio segment or class certain existing disclosures and provide certain new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses 
this asu is effective for public companies  for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  regarding disclosures as of the end of the reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  regarding disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period 
since this update only relates to disclosures  the adoption of asu no 
did not have a significant impact on our results from operations or financial position 
described below are critical accounting policies  which should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto for a full understanding of our financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition the timing of revenue recognition for sales distribution and company operating restaurants  and franchise revenues rents and royalties and franchise fees does not involve significant estimates and assumptions 
sales we operate warehouses in canada to distribute coffee and other dry goods and refrigerated and frozen products to an extensive franchise system 
revenues from these sales are recorded when the product is delivered to the franchisee  or in certain cases  where the product is delivered to a third party distributor 
revenue at company operated restaurants is recognized upon tender of payment at the time of sale 
sales related to variable interest entities are recognized when product is delivered to a third part  in the case of our previously held maidstone bakeries joint venture  or upon the tender of payment at the time of sale in the case of non owned restaurants that are consolidated in accordance with asc franchise revenues our restaurants are predominantly franchised 
we grant franchise licenses or operator agreements to independent operators who in turn pay franchise fees and other payments  which may include payments for equipment  royalties and  in most cases  rents for each restaurant opened 
franchise fees are collected at the time of sale or resale or renovation of the franchised restaurant 
franchise fees and equipment sales are generally recognized as income when each restaurant commences operations and payment is received from the franchisee  unless the franchisee is participating in our franchise incentive program fip see below 
rental revenue  excluding contingent rent  is recognized on a straight line basis 
contingent rent is recognized in the month earned 
royalties  based on a percentage of monthly sales  are recognized as income in the month earned on the accrual basis and are normally collected within the month or shortly thereafter 
we have developed a fip available to certain of our us restaurant owners  which provides financing for both the initial franchise fee and the purchase of certain restaurant equipment  furniture  trade fixtures  and interior signs 
the payment for those assets is deferred for a period of weeks from the date of opening 
the initial franchise fee is recognized at the time of opening the restaurant and the equipment revenue is recognized after a sustained period of sales levels are achieved  or at the end of week term  whichever is earlier 
the restaurant owner has the option to pay for the initial franchise fee  including interest thereon  on a weekly basis over a period of up to weeks from the opening of the restaurant 
the initial franchise fee revenues are recognized at the time of restaurant opening  with consideration for potential uncollectibility 
should we determine that a franchise sold under this program is a vie and we are the primary beneficiary  we do not recognize any revenue until we are no longer the primary beneficiary and we meet the criteria noted above 

table of contents we generally control  either through ownership or by leasing  a significant majority of the real estate on which our restaurants are located  and we lease the real estate to our restaurant owners 
rental income is recorded on an accrual basis 
most leases provide for fixed payments with contingent or percentage rent after sales exceed certain levels  while others provide for monthly rentals based solely on a percentage of sales 
fixed  or base  rental revenue is recorded on a straight line basis and contingent or percentage rental revenue is recognized when sales exceed certain levels 
the financing is initially recorded at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortized cost 
we have established reserves based on net realizable value  related to the collection of franchise royalties and other franchise related receivables and commitments when it is not probable that amounts will be collected 
although we generally enjoy a positive relationship with our restaurant owners  and collection rates have historically been high  if average sales or the financial health of our restaurant owners were to deteriorate  we might have to increase reserves against collection of franchise revenues 
effective december   we adopted asu no 
disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses as codified in asc receivables 
this update improves the disclosures that an entity provides about the credit quality of its financing receivables  excluding short term trade receivables  and the related allowance for credit losses 
as a result of these amendments  an entity is required to disaggregate by portfolio segment or class certain existing disclosures and provide certain new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses 
this asu is effective for public companies  for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  regarding disclosures as of the end of the reporting period  and for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  regarding disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period 
since this update only relates to disclosures  the adoption of asu no 
did not have a significant impact on our results from operations or financial position 
the real estate site selection for restaurants is generally controlled by us 
restaurant owners receive assistance in such areas as purchasing and marketing from company personnel 
these franchise expenses are included in franchise fee costs 
franchise fee revenues are comprised of revenues primarily from the sale of equipment related to establishing a restaurant owner s business and the initial franchise fee 
restaurant owners may receive other financial assistance  or relief  relating to lower rents and royalties and reductions or assistance with certain other operating costs for restaurants in new and developing markets  and the amount of this relief is recorded as a reduction to our rents and royalties revenues 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with asc income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method whereby income taxes reflect the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets or liabilities for accounting purposes as compared to tax purposes 
a deferred income tax asset or liability is determined for each temporary difference based on the currently enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect when the underlying items of income and expense are expected to be realized  except for the amount of earnings related to our foreign operations where repatriation is not contemplated in the foreseeable future 
income taxes reported in the consolidated statement of operations include the current and deferred portions of the expense 
income taxes applicable to items charged or credited to equity are netted with such items 
changes in deferred income taxes related to a change in tax rates are recognized in the period when the tax rate change is enacted 
in addition  the consolidated statement of operations contain items that are non taxable or non deductible for income tax purposes and  accordingly  cause the income tax provision to be different from what it would be if based on statutory rates 
when considered necessary  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
management must make estimates and judgments on future taxable income  considering feasible tax planning strategies and taking into account existing facts and circumstances  to determine the proper valuation allowance 
when we determine that deferred tax assets could be realized in greater or lesser amounts than recorded  the asset balance and income statement reflect the change in the period 
table of contents such determination is made 
due to changes in facts and circumstances and the estimates and judgments that are involved in determining the proper valuation allowance  differences between actual future events and prior estimates and judgments could result in adjustments to this valuation allowance 
under the accounting standards for uncertain tax positions contained in asc  a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized in the financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the standards require that changes in judgment that result in subsequent recognition  derecognition or a change in measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period including any related interest and penalties be recognized as a discrete item in the interim period in which the change occurs 
we record interest and potential penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
the standards require that a liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit be classified as long term liability except for the liabilities that are expected to be settled within the next twelve months 
property and equipment we carry our property and equipment at cost 
depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives depreciation periods buildings and leasehold improvements to years or lease term restaurant other equipment to years capital leases to years or lease term computer hardware and software to years advertising fund property and equipment to years manufacturing and other equipment to years construction in progress reclassified to above categories when put in use we estimate useful lives on buildings and equipment based on historical data and industry trends 
we monitor our capitalization and amortization policies to ensure they remain appropriate 
lives may be related to legal or contractual lives or must be estimated by management based on specific circumstances 
lease term as defined in asc leases 
interest and other costs associated with the construction of new restaurants and facilities are capitalized 
major improvements are capitalized  while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
gains and losses on the disposition of property and equipment are included in other income  net in the consolidated statement of operations 
advertising fund property and equipment includes certain assets purchased or leased by the advertising fund 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets are grouped at the lowest level of independent cash flows and tested for impairment whenever an event or circumstance occurs that indicate impairment may exist triggering event  which may include a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of prior to its estimated useful life 
restaurant related long lived assets are grouped into operating markets as this is the lowest identifiable level of independent cash flows 
events such as prolonged negative same store sales growth in the market  which is a key operating metric  or prolonged negative cash flows in the operating market  are indicators that we use in 
table of contents evaluating whether an impairment may exist 
we also test for impairment if we have a higher than normal amount of restaurant closures in any one market 
we also consider the length of time we have been in the market as it takes time to fully establish a market 
generally  if same store sales decline over time on a consecutive basis  further evaluation may be required  including a review of operating market cash flows 
the impairment analysis of the triggering events described above differs depending upon whether the affected market is considered a developed market or a developing market 
in developed markets  one of the key indicators for the overall health of an operating market is same store sales growth 
in developing markets  we assess a number of factors  including systemwide sales growth  which encompasses new restaurants and same store sales growth  the stage of growth of the operating market and the average unit sales volume trends  as well as a higher than normal amount of restaurant closures in a market 
given the external market conditions present for the majority of the period under review  we also make assessments as to whether declines are an indication of expected long term performance for the developing market or whether the declines may be more temporary due to the impact of external market conditions 
non restaurant related assets are grouped based on their ability to generate independent cash flows 
in the case of our manufacturing facilities  they are grouped on a facility by facility basis 
corporate assets  which relate primarily to land  buildings  and computer hardware and software systems  are grouped on a consolidated level with all long lived assets as they support the entire business and independent cash flows are not generated from these specific assets 
if it is determined that a triggering event has occurred  an undiscounted cash flow analysis is completed on the affected market to determine if the future expected cash flows of a market are sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets 
if it is determined that the undiscounted cash flows are insufficient  then the market is deemed to be impaired 
the fair value of the property and equipment is estimated using primarily third party appraisals or the discounted cash flows  as appropriate 
the estimated fair value is allocated to individual assets within the group 
gift certificates and cash cards we have a tim card a quick pay cash card program 
generally  customers can prepay using cash  debit card or credit card for future purchases at participating tim hortons restaurants or over the internet by reloading a dollar value onto their tim card when and as needed 
a tim card entitles the holder to use the value for purchasing product only and the amounts generally are nonrefundable and not redeemable for cash 
tim card holders are not entitled to any interest  dividends or returns on prepaid amounts 
there are no expiration dates on the cash cards  and we do not charge any service fees that cause a decrease to customer balances 
cash collected from the loading of the tim card is recorded as restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investments on the consolidated balance sheet since these funds have been designated for use only by the cash card program to honour outstanding obligations 
changes in the restricted cash and cash equivalents balances have been classified as an operating activity on the consolidated statement of cash flows while changes in the restricted investments are classified as an investing activity 
the restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investment balances at january  and january   represent the prepaid amounts not yet redeemed by customers 
the outstanding customer obligations for both tim cards and gift certificates are recorded in accrued liabilities  other on the consolidated balance sheet 
since the inception of the program  interest on the restricted cash and cash equivalents and restricted investments has been contributed to our advertising and promotion funds to help offset costs associated with this program 
while we will honour all cash cards presented for payment  we may  based on historical review after the program has been in place for some time  determine the likelihood of redemption to be remote for certain card balances due to  among other factors  long periods of inactivity 
in these circumstances  to the extent management determines there is no requirement for remitting card balances to government agencies under unclaimed property laws and legal requirements governing gift card programs  the obligation for any such card balances may be transferred to our advertising and promotion funds 
no such amounts were recognized in  or 
table of contents in addition to the tim card program  we have gift certificates available in a limited number of non traditional locations 
the company will continue to honour outstanding gift certificates 
when a customer uses a gift certificate or a tim card to purchase product at a company operated restaurant  we recognize the revenue from the sale of the product 
when a customer uses a gift certificate or tim card at a franchised restaurant  we recognize revenues  in the form of rents and royalties  arising from the sale of the product 
we recognize income on unredeemed gift certificates gift certificate breakage when it can determine that the likelihood of the gift certificate being redeemed is remote and that there is no legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift certificate value to relevant jurisdictions 
we determine gift certificate breakage based on historical redemption patterns 
once the breakage rate is determined  it is recognized over a seven year time period which is the estimated life of a gift certificate 
reserve contingencies for litigation and other matters in the normal course of business  we must make continuing estimates of potential future legal obligations and liabilities  which requires the use of management s judgment on the outcome of various issues 
management may also use outside legal advice to assist in the estimating process  however  the ultimate outcome of various legal issues could be different than management estimates  and adjustments to income could be required 
variable interest entities in accordance with asc  we analyze our variable interests  including our equity investments and certain license or operator arrangements with various entities 
we determine our interests in variable interest entities vies  and then assess whether we are considered to be the primary beneficiary of these vies 
if it is determined that we are the primary beneficiary  we then consolidate the vie s assets  liabilities  results of operations and cash flows 
if we are not the primary beneficiary  we account for such interests using other applicable us gaap 
we enter into flexible lease arrangements with certain operators who are not required to invest a significant amount of capital 
in addition  us franchisees participating in the fip fip franchisee do not have a significant amount of initial capital invested that is not financed directly by us 
because the legal entity within which such an operator or fip franchisee operates is considered not to be adequately capitalized  that entity is considered a vie as defined in the master glossary of the fasb codification and according to the provisions in asc based on management s review of the financial statements it receives from these operators and fip franchisees  the projections performed by the company indicate that we are  in some instances  the primary beneficiary of expected returns or losses as that term is defined by asc  of these vies 
accordingly  we have consolidated on average  to restaurants during fiscal to fiscal vies for which we are determined to be the primary beneficiary have an inconsequential impact on our reported consolidated net income and cash flows 
the impact of consolidating these vies to our consolidated balance sheets is also not significant 
there are a small percentage of restaurants considered to be vies in which we hold a significant variable interest  but for which we are not the primary beneficiary 
our maximum exposure to loss as a result of our involvement with this small percentage of franchise restaurants is also inconsequential 
we have no equity interest in any of our restaurant owners 
none of our assets serve as collateral for the consolidated restaurants  and creditors of these operators have no recourse to us 
the only significant exposure to us related to these vies relates to the collection of amounts due to us  which are collected weekly 
generally  the agreements governing the license arrangements can be cancelled by either the restaurant owner or us with days notice  further reducing our potential exposure 
in connection with rsu awards granted to employees  we established the tdl rsu plan trust that purchases and retains common shares to satisfy our contractual obligation to deliver shares to settle the awards for most canadian employees 
for accounting purposes  the cost of the shares held by the trust has been accounted for as a reduction in outstanding common shares  and the trust has been consolidated in accordance with asc as a vie since the company is the primary beneficiary 

table of contents fair value measurements asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under asc as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under asc must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs 
the first two levels are considered observable and the last unobservable 
these are used to measure fair value as follows level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs  other than level inputs  that are observable for the assets or liabilities  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted market prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or  other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
in accordance with asc and asc  the tables below outline the company s outstanding derivatives and fair value measurements as at and for the years ended january  and january  the following table summarizes the classification and fair value of non financial assets on the consolidated balance sheet as at january  in thousands fair value hierarchy fair value asset liability classification on consolidated balance sheet long lived assets level  inventories and other long lived assets level  property and equipment  net total the company recorded an asset impairment charge of million in relating to the long lived assets of the company s portland  providence and hartford markets in the new england region see note 
the most significant long lived assets are property and buildings for which the fair value of the underlying real estate was estimated to be approximately million 
management estimated the fair value of the real estate assets by using independent property valuations 
these valuations are considered to be a level valuation on the fair value hierarchy 
a change in management s fair value estimate of the assets would either increase or decrease the value of the assets by less than million 
in addition  the company values its assets held for sale at the lower of historical cost or fair value less cost to sell 
when applicable  fair value is generally based on third party appraisals 
stock based compensation our stock incentive plan  as amended the plan is an omnibus plan  designed to allow for a broad range of equity based compensation awards in the form of restricted stock units rsus  stock options  stock appreciation rights sars  dividend equivalent rights ders  performance awards and share awards 
we currently provide compensation to certain employees under the plan in the form of restricted stock units and stock options with tandem sars 
in addition  we issue deferred stock units dsus to our directors under our non employee director deferred stock unit plan 
we previously issued restricted stock units to directors  
table of contents but these were fully vested and settled in november we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of asc compensation stock compensation 
restricted stock units rsus are measured at the fair market value based on the closing price of our common shares traded on the toronto stock exchange on the first business day preceding the grant date 
rsus are generally expensed on a straight line basis over the vesting period except for grants to retirement eligible employees  which unless the grant of the rsu is subject to a performance condition  are expensed immediately 
these expenses are recorded in general and administrative expenses  consistent with the classification of the related employee compensation expense 
rsus have accompanying ders 
in addition  we may grant performance conditioned rsus to certain of our employees 
the performance component is based on prior year performance and is only used to determine the amount of units granted 
all other characteristics of the performance based rsus are the same as restricted stock 
deferred stock units dsus are granted to non employee members of our board of directors and are expensed on the date of grant since they vest immediately  although they are not payable until a director s separation from service 
dsus are notional units which track the value of our common shares 
these units are settled in cash based on the value of our common shares on the toronto stock exchange on the date of the director s separation of service from the company 
since the awards are settled in cash  the award is accounted for using the liability method  which results in a revaluation of the liability to fair value each period and expensed 
dsus have accompanying ders  which are expensed as earned 
stock options the company uses the black scholes merton option pricing model to value outstanding options which requires the use of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include the estimated length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them the expected term  the expected volatility of our common share price over the expected term  and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
the awards are accounted for using the liability method  which results in a revaluation of the liability to fair value each period  and are expensed over the vesting period 
stock options with tandem sars see below granted to retirement eligible employees are expensed immediately 
changes in subjective assumptions as well as changes in the share price from period to period  can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amount of compensation expense recognized on the consolidated statements of operations 
we issued stock option awards with tandem sars for the first time to our named executive officers in fiscal and to all of our officers in fiscal stock appreciation rights sars may be granted alone or in conjunction with a stock option 
a sar related to an option terminates upon the expiration  forfeiture  or exercise of the related option  and is exercisable only to the extent that the related option is exercisable 
stock options with tandem sars enable the employee to exercise the stock option to receive common shares or to exercise the sar and receive a cash payment in each case of a value equal to the difference between the market price of the share on the exercise date and the exercise price of the stock option 
segmented reporting we operate exclusively in the food service industry and have determined that our reportable segments are those that are based on methods of internal reporting and management structure and represent the manner in which our chief decision maker views and evaluates the various aspects of our business 
our reportable segments are the geographic locations of canada and the us recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  as codified in asc revenue recognition 
the objective of this asu is 
table of contents to address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
the asu also establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable and has expanded disclosures related to vendor s multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and we are currently assessing the potential impact  if any  the adoption of this asu may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued asu no 
effect of denominating the exercise price of a share based payment award in the currency of the market in which the underlying equity security trades as codified in asc compensation stock compensation 
this update addresses the classification of a share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which the underlying equity security trades 
asc is amended to clarify that a share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trades shall not be considered to contain a market  performance  or service condition 
therefore  such an award is not to be classified as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity classification 
this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and we are currently assessing the potential impact  if any  the adoption of this update may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fas issued asu no 
revenue recognition milestone method of revenue recognition as codified in asc revenue recognition 
this update provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
consideration that is contingent on achievement of a milestone in its entirety may be recognized as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone is judged to meet certain criteria to be considered substantive 
milestones should be considered substantive in their entirety and may not be bifurcated 
an arrangement may contain both substantive and nonsubstantive milestones that should be evaluated individually 
this asu is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   and we are currently assessing the potential impact  if any  the adoption of this update may have on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of accounting pronouncements not yet implemented in february  the sec released commission statement in support of convergence and global accounting standards 
the statement includes a detailed work plan to be executed by the sec staff in its analysis in determining both whether and how to incorporate international financial reporting standards ifrs into the us financial reporting system 
ifrs is a comprehensive series of accounting standards published by the international accounting standards board 
under the proposed roadmap  if the sec incorporates ifrs into the us domestic reporting system  companies could be required to prepare financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with ifrs as early as fiscal as a foreign private issuer  the company is able to apply ifrs earlier if certain approvals are obtained 
further  although canadian securities laws generally require canadian reporting issuers to apply ifrs beginning in  national instrument acceptable accounting principles  auditing standards and reporting currency permits issuers that have a class of securities registered under section of the us securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act or are required to file reports under section d of the exchange act and which are not registered or required to be registered as an investment company under the us investment company act of  to elect to prepare financial statements that are filed with or delivered to a securities regulatory authority or regulator other than acquisition statements in accordance with us gaap 
pending the developments of the sec s work plan  the company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption of ifrs would have on the condensed consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes and disclosures  and will continue to monitor the development of the potential implementation of ifrs 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks associated with foreign exchange rates  commodity prices  interest rates and inflation 
in accordance with our policies  we manage our exposure to these various market based risks 
foreign exchange risk our exposure to foreign exchange risk is primarily related to fluctuations between the canadian dollar and the us dollar 
our primary foreign exchange exposure to our cash flows results from purchases by canadian operations in us dollars and payments from canadian operations to us operations 
net cash flows between the canadian and us dollar currencies were approximately million for fiscal in addition  we are exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations when we translate our us operating results into canadian dollars for reporting purposes 
while these fluctuations are not significant to the consolidated operating results  the fluctuations in exchange rates do impact our us segment operating results  and can affect the comparability between quarters and year to year 
also  from time to time  we hold us dollars and other us dollar net positions in canadian dollar functional currency entities to support our business needs 
the holding of us dollar net positions in these entities can cause foreign exchange gains and losses which are included in other expense income  net  and can  therefore  affect our earnings 
we seek to manage significant cash flows and net income exposures related to exchange rate changes between these two currencies 
we may use derivative products to reduce the risk of a significant impact on our cash flows or net income 
forward currency contracts are entered into to reduce some of the risk related to purchases paid for by the canadian operations in us dollars  such as coffee  including certain intercompany purchases 
we do not hedge foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on net income and cash flows 
we have a policy forbidding speculating in foreign currency 
by their nature  derivative financial instruments involve risk including the credit risk of non performance by counterparties  and our maximum potential loss may exceed the amount recognized in our balance sheet 
to minimize this risk  except in certain circumstances  we limit the notional amount per counterparty to a maximum of million 
we have reviewed counterparty risk related to these derivative positions and do not believe there is significant risk with respect to these instruments 
forward currency contracts to sell canadian dollars and buy us million and us million were outstanding as of january  and january   respectively  primarily to hedge coffee purchases from third parties  including intercompany purchases 
the fair value unrealized loss on these forward contracts was million as of january   compared to an unrealized loss of million as of january  at the current level of annual operating income generated from our us operations and current us dollar cash flow exposures  if the us currency rate changes by the entire year  the annual impact on our net income and annual cash flows would not be material 
commodity risk we purchase certain products such as coffee  wheat  edible oil and sugar and other prepared products  the prices of which are affected by commodity prices  in the normal course of business 
therefore  we are exposed to some price volatility related to weather and  more importantly  various other market conditions outside of our control 
however  we do employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility 
generally  these techniques include setting fixed prices for periods of up to one year with suppliers  setting in advance the price for products to be delivered in the future  and unit pricing based on an average of commodity prices over the corresponding period of time 
we purchase a significant amount of green coffee and typically have purchase commitments fixing the price for a minimum of six to twelve months depending upon prevailing market conditions 
given the current volatility in the commodity markets  we covered our key commodities through all of in an effort to have price certainty and security of supply 
we also typically hedge against the risk of foreign exchange on green coffee prices at the same time 
we do not generally make use 
table of contents of financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  partly because of our other contract pricing techniques outlined above 
as we make purchases beyond our current commitments  we may be subject to higher commodity prices depending upon prevailing market conditions 
increases and decreases in commodity costs are largely passed through to franchisees  resulting in higher or lower revenues and higher or lower costs of sales from our business 
these changes may impact margins as many of these products are typically priced based on a fixed dollar mark up 
we and our restaurant owners have some ability to increase product pricing to offset a rise in commodity prices  subject to acceptance by restaurant owners and customers 
these cost and pricing changes can impact revenues  costs and margins  and can create volatility quarter over quarter and year over year 
see item a 
risk factors increases in the cost of commodities could have an adverse impact on our business and financial results 
interest rate risk in the second and fourth quarters of  we issued million and million of senior notes  which were offered on a private placement basis in canada with a term of seven years 
net proceeds from the senior notes were primarily used to prepay million of our existing term debt  prior to maturity 
the senior notes bear a fixed coupon interest rate of  and an effective rate of resulting from the settlement of interest rate forwards used to hedge the interest rate prior to the issuance of the first portion of the senior notes  premium recorded on the subsequent issue of senior notes and the deferred financing fees associated with the issuances 
as our cash is invested in short term variable rate instruments  we are now exposed on a net basis to interest rate movements on a net asset position when historically we have been exposed on a net liability position 
if interest rates change by basis points  the impact on our annual net income would not be material 
inflation consolidated financial statements determined on an historical cost basis may not accurately reflect all the effects of changing prices on an enterprise 
several factors tend to reduce the impact of inflation for our business inventories approximate current market prices  property holdings at fixed costs are substantial  and there is some ability to adjust prices 
however  if several of the various costs in our business experience inflation at the same time  such as commodity price increases beyond our ability to control and increased labour costs  we and our restaurant owners may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of the various cost increases without negatively impacting consumer demand
