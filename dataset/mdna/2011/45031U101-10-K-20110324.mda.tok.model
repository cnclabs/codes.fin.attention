this discussion summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity during the three year period ended december  this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes for the three year period ended december  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
these historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future performance 
we reclassified certain items in our consolidated financial statements of prior years to conform to our current year presentation 
overview istar financial inc is a fully integrated finance and investment company focused on the commercial real estate industry 
we provide custom tailored investment capital to high end private and corporate owners of real estate and invest directly across a range of real estate sectors 
we are taxed as a real estate investment trust  or reit  and have invested more than billion over the past two decades 
our three primary business segments are lending  net leasing and real estate investment 
our primary sources of revenues are interest income  which is the interest that borrowers pay on loans  and operating lease income  which is the rent that corporate customers pay to lease our properties 
we primarily generate income through the spread or margin  which is the difference between the revenues generated from loans and leases and interest expense and the cost of net lease operations 
going forward  we also expect to earn income from our other real estate investments 
income from real estate investments may include operating revenues as well as income from sales of properties either in bulk or through unit sales 
this income will be reduced by holding costs while the real estate investments are redeveloped  repositioned and eventually sold 
the economic recession and tightening of capital markets adversely affected our business 
we experienced significant provisions for loan losses and impairments resulting from high levels of non performing loans and increasing amounts of real estate owned as we took title to assets of defaulting borrowers 
the economic conditions and their effect on our operations resulted in increases in our financing costs and an inability to access the unsecured debt markets 
since the beginning of the crisis  we 
table of contents have focused primarily on resolving problem assets  generating liquidity  retiring debt  decreasing leverage and preserving shareholder value 
we saw early signs of an economic recovery during  including some improvements in the commercial real estate market and greater stability in the capital markets 
this was evidenced in our own portfolio by increased liquidity from loan repayments and asset sales  better pricing for commercial real estate assets  improved risk ratings and reductions in non performing and watch list assets as compared to and in addition  the trends of increases in loan loss provisions and performing loans becoming non performing reversed course in many of the improving trends in our financial condition and operating results are dependent on a sustained recovery  however  there can be no assurance that the recent improvement in conditions will continue in the future 
for the year ended december   we recorded net income of million 
this was an improvement from net losses of million and million in and  respectively  and was primarily due to reduced provisions for loan losses and impairments of million in  compared to approximately billion in each of the prior two years 
results for the year also benefited from million in gains  primarily resulting from the disposition of a billion portfolio of net lease assets  as well as million of gains from early extinguishment of debt 
in addition to gains recorded in the current year  we recorded gains on early extinguishment of debt of million and million during and  respectively  resulting from retirements that contributed to a billion reduction of debt during the past three years 
the market values of our debt have recovered significantly from their depressed values in previous years 
aside from the redemption of our senior secured notes discussed below  we do not expect to record significant gains from early extinguishments of debt for the foreseeable future while prices for our debt remain at or above their current levels 
during  we reduced our net exposure to non performing loans to billion as of december   compared to billion at december  in some cases these loans were sold or modified and in many cases we took possession of properties serving as collateral for these loans through foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure 
these foreclosed assets were classified as real estate held for investment rehi or other real estate owned oreo based on our strategy to either hold the properties over a longer period or to market them for sale in the near term 
together  these properties constitute our real estate investment portfolio  which has increased to billion as of december   from billion at the end of the overall increase in this portfolio was driven by new rehi assets that we took title to during the year  offset by net reductions in oreo as we made progress in monetizing assets through disposition 
we generally seek to reposition the distressed assets within this portfolio through the infusion of capital and or intensive asset management  with the objective of maximizing our recovery with respect to the investments 
further  we believe that impairments recognized on many of these assets prior to being transferred into this portfolio create an attractive below cost investment basis  which  combined with our repositioning and development efforts  should enable us to create value from this portfolio 
while we work on repositioning these assets  we expect to continue to incur elevated carrying costs 
these costs totaled million in and million in during the year ended december   we generated a total of billion in proceeds from our portfolio  comprised of billion in gross loan principal repayments  million in loan sales  million from sales of oreo assets and billion from sales of net lease assets 
these proceeds were used in part to reduce the company debt obligations by billion and fully retire the remaining million a participation associated with the acquisition of the fremont portfolio 
additionally  we funded a total of million in new and pre existing investments 
the new investments we made in were primarily sourced from our existing portfolio 
we believe that making additional investments in assets within our portfolio may present more attractive risk adjusted return opportunities than are otherwise available in the market  because of our existing relationships with the customers and knowledge of the assets 

table of contents in march  we entered into a billion senior secured credit facility and used the proceeds to repay approximately billion of outstanding borrowings under our existing secured credit facilities  which were due to mature in june and june proceeds were also used to repay million of our unsecured credit facilities due in june we expect to use the remaining proceeds to repay unsecured debt maturing in the first half of as well as other corporate purposes 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we repaid the remaining million principal amount of unsecured senior notes due march and completed the redemption of our remaining million principal amount of senior secured notes due june in connection with the redemption  we expect to record a gain of approximately million on early extinguishment of debt during the first quarter of see subsequent events below 
after giving effect to the new secured credit facility and repayments noted above  we will have approximately million of debt maturing and minimum required amortization payments due on or before december  we expect that liquidity in the coming year will primarily be provided by loan repayments as well as strategic asset sales and proceeds from planned oreo sales 
we believe that proceeds from these activities will be sufficient to meet our obligations during the remainder of the year  however  the timing and amounts of proceeds from expected asset repayments and sales are subject to factors outside of our control and cannot be predicted with certainty 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  change change in thousands interest income operating lease income other income total revenue interest expense operating costs net lease assets operating costs rehi and oreo depreciation and amortization general and administrative provision for loan losses impairment of assets other expense total costs and expenses gain on early extinguishment of debt  net earnings from equity method investments income from discontinued operations gain from discontinued operations net income loss revenue the decrease in interest income is primarily a result of a decline in the balance of performing loans to billion at december  from billion at december  the decline in performing loans was primarily driven by loan repayments and note sales as well as loans moving to non performing status 
see risk management below 
operating lease income from net lease assets decreased primarily due to a slight decrease in tenant occupancy rates and lower rent received as a result of lease restructurings 

table of contents offsetting these declines in revenue was an increase in other income primarily driven by an increase in operating revenue from rehi assets and loan prepayment penalties received 
revenue from rehi assets increased to million in from million in due to the increase in real estate assets held for investment 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses decreased primarily due to lower provisions for loan losses  fewer impairments of assets and reduced interest expense 
the decline in our provision for loan losses was primarily due to fewer loans moving to non performing status during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the decrease in loans moving to non performing status during the year can be attributed to a smaller overall loan portfolio and improving economic conditions and credit environment 
additionally  loan repayments and sales have led to a smaller performing loan asset base  which has resulted in a reduction in the required general loan loss reserve 
see risk management below 
impairment of assets for the year ended december  primarily consisted of million of impairments on oreo assets 
asset impairments in were significantly higher due to declining real estate values and distressed economic conditions 
these impairments included million of impairments on rehi and oreo assets  on net lease assets  million on investment securities  million on equity investments and million on goodwill 
interest expense decreased primarily due to the repayment and retirement of debt during the last months as well as the exchange of senior unsecured notes for new second lien senior secured notes completed in may the carrying value of our debt declined to billion at december  from billion at december  in addition  the weighted average interest rate on outstanding debt decreased to for the year ended december  from during the same period in primarily due to the repayment of higher rate debt obligations 
other expense was lower primarily due to a million charge incurred in pursuant to a settlement agreement under which we terminated a long term lease for new headquarters space and settled all disputes with the landlord 
the decrease in general and administrative expense was primarily due to million of rent expense incurred during the year ended december  relating to a lease for new headquarters space which was terminated in may stock based compensation expense also declined by million primarily due to amortization of newer stock awards with lower values than those granted in prior years 
the increase in operating costs for rehi and oreo was primarily due to the increase in the number of assets held during as compared to in gain on early extinguishment of debt  net during  we retired million par value of our senior secured and unsecured notes through open market repurchases and we redeemed million of senior secured notes 
together  these transactions resulted in an aggregate gain on early extinguishment of debt of million 
notes repurchased in yielded lower gains than in the prior year primarily because they were trading closer to par 
these gains were offset by million associated with expensing the unamortized deferred financing costs and other costs incurred in connection with the prepayments of our billion first priority credit agreement  which was due to mature in june  and our million non recourse secured term loan and another secured term loan that were each collateralized by net lease assets we sold during the period 
during  we retired billion par value of our senior unsecured notes though open market repurchases at discounts to par and recognized million in gain on early extinguishment of debt 
additionally  we completed our secured note exchange transactions and purchased million of our outstanding senior floating rates notes in a cash tender offer  which resulted in an aggregate net gain on early extinguishment of debt of million 

table of contents earnings from equity method investments the increase in earnings from equity method investments was primarily attributable to better overall market performance that affected our strategic investments in as compared to in addition  during we recorded a million non cash out of period charge to recognize losses from an equity method investment as a result of additional depreciation expense that should have been recorded at the equity method entity in prior periods 
discontinued operations during the year ended december   we sold a portfolio of net lease assets and other net lease assets and recognized aggregate gains of million 
income from discontinued operations in included the net income from those net lease assets sold during the period 
during the year ended december   we sold four net lease assets and recognized aggregate gains of million 
income from discontinued operations in included the net income from net lease assets sold in the past months offset by million of impairments on those sold assets 
results of operations for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  change change in thousands interest income operating lease income other income total revenue interest expense operating costs net lease assets operating costs rehi and oreo depreciation and amortization general and administrative provision for loan losses impairment of assets other expense total costs and expenses gain on early extinguishment of debt gain on sale of joint venture interest earnings from equity method investments income from discontinued operations gain from discontinued operations net income loss revenue the decline in interest income year over year primarily resulted from a decrease in the carrying value of performing loans to billion at the end of from billion at the end of this decrease in performing loans was primarily due to assets moving from performing to non performing status  as well as loan repayments and note sales that contributed to the decline in income generating loans 
lower interest rates also contributed to the decline in interest income with one month libor averaging in versus in however  the impact to overall rates from the decline in libor rates was tempered by interest rate floors  resulting in a weighted average interest rate of in effect on approximately billion of loans at december  the year over year change in other income was primarily driven by certain one time transactions in including million of income recognized from the redemption of a participation interest in a 
table of contents lending investment and million of income recognized when we exchanged a cost method equity investment for a loan receivable 
additionally  other loan related income  such as prepayment penalties  declined by million from to slightly offsetting this increase were million of realized and unrealized gains on trading securities held in our other investment portfolio 
operating lease income from net lease assets decreased primarily due to a slight decrease in tenant occupancy rates 
costs and expenses total costs and expenses decreased primarily due to decreases in impairment of assets and interest expense partially offset by an increase in provision for loan losses 
impairment of assets in included million of impairments on oreo and rehi assets  million of impairments on securities and equity investments  million of impairments on net lease assets and million of impairments on goodwill 
impairments in were significantly higher and included million of impairments on securities and equity investments  million of impairments on goodwill and intangible assets  million of impairments on oreo assets  and million of impairments on net lease assets 
the decline in interest expense year over year is primarily a result of reducing outstanding debt balances from repurchases and repayments 
in an effort to generate gains on certain of our debt securities which have traded at discounts to par  as discussed further below  we repurchased billion par value of our senior unsecured notes during and we also repaid an additional million at maturity 
in addition  we completed an exchange of senior unsecured notes for new second lien senior secured notes in may this exchange resulted in a million deferred gain reflected as a premium to the new notes which is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over the terms of the new notes 
in  we recognized million in amortization of this premium as a reduction to interest expense 
lower libor rates also contributed to our decrease in interest expense  with our average borrowing rates decreasing to in from in general and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll and employee related costs from reductions in headcount 
the increase in our provision for loan losses in was caused by the continued deterioration in the commercial real estate market and weakened economic conditions that negatively impacted our borrowers ability to service their debt and refinance their loans at maturity 
this resulted in additional asset specific reserves due to the increasing level of non performing loans within the portfolio along with declining values of real estate collateral that secure such loans 
other expense was higher primarily due to a million charge incurred during pursuant to a settlement agreement under which we terminated a long term lease for new headquarters space and settled all disputes with a landlord 
the increase in operating costs for oreo and rehi was primarily due to the increase in the number of assets held during as compared to during gain on early extinguishment of debt in  we retired billion par value of our senior unsecured notes through open market repurchases at discounts to par and recognized million in gain on early extinguishment of debt 
additionally  we completed our secured note exchange transactions and purchased million of our outstanding senior floating rate notes in a cash tender offer which resulted in an aggregate gain on early extinguishment of debt of million 
during  we retired million par value of our senior unsecured notes through open market repurchases at discounts to par which resulted in an aggregate gain on early extinguishment of debt of million 

table of contents gain on sale of joint venture interest in april  we closed on the sale of our timberstar southwest joint venture for a gross sales price of billion  including the assumption of debt 
we received net proceeds of million for our interest in the venture and recorded a gain of million 
discontinued operations during  we sold four net lease assets and recognized gains of million while income from discontinued operations in included impairment charges of million on net lease assets sold during the year or held for sale at the end of the year 
during  we sold several net lease assets and our maine timber property for gains of million  while income from discontinued operations included higher operating results for those properties sold or classified as held for sale in and adjusted earnings we measure our performance using adjusted earnings in addition to net income 
adjusted earnings represents net income attributable to us and allocable to our common shareholders  hpu holders and participating security holders computed in accordance with gaap  before depreciation  depletion  amortization  gain from discontinued operations  impairments of goodwill and intangible assets and extraordinary items 
adjustments for joint ventures reflect our share of adjusted earnings calculated on the same basis 
we believe that adjusted earnings has historically been a helpful measure to consider  in addition to net income loss  because this measure has helped us to evaluate how our commercial real estate finance business is performing compared to other commercial finance companies  without the effects of certain gaap adjustments that are not necessarily indicative of current operating performance 
the most significant gaap adjustments that we exclude in determining adjusted earnings are depreciation and amortization which are typically non cash charges as well as gain from discontinued operations 
as a commercial finance company that focuses on real estate lending and net leasing  we record significant depreciation on our real estate assets  and deferred financing amortization associated with our borrowings 
depreciation and amortization do not affect our daily operations  but they do impact financial results under gaap 
adjusted earnings is not an alternative or substitute for net income loss in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance 
rather  we believe that adjusted earnings is an additional measure that helps us analyze how our business is performing 
adjusted earnings should not be viewed as an alternative measure of either our operating liquidity or funds available for our cash needs or 
table of contents for distribution to our shareholders 
in addition  we may not calculate adjusted earnings in the same manner as other companies that use a similarly titled measure

table of contents risk management loan credit statistics the table below summarizes our non performing loans  watch list loans and the reserves for loan losses associated with our loans in thousands as of december  non performing loans carrying value as a percentage of total carrying value of loans watch list loans carrying value as a percentage of total carrying value of loans reserve for loan losses total reserve for loan losses as a percentage of total loans before loan loss reserves non performing loan asset specific reserves for loan losses as a percentage of gross carrying value of non performing loans explanatory notes as of december   carrying values of loans included the remaining outstanding participation interest on loans in the fremont cre portfolio  which was million for non performing loans  million for watch list loans and million for total loans 
the participation was fully repaid in october and therefore is not reflected in the values as of december  as of december  and  carrying values of non performing loans are net of asset specific reserves for loan losses of million and billion  respectively 
non performing loans we designate loans as non performing at such time as the loan becomes days delinquent  the loan has a maturity default  or management determines it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
all non performing loans are placed on non accrual status and income is only recognized in certain cases upon actual cash receipt 
as of december   we had non performing loans with an aggregate carrying value of billion  or of the total carrying value of loans 
our non performing loans decreased during the year ended december   primarily due to transfers of non performing loans to rehi and oreo as well as sales and repayments 
watch list loans during our quarterly loan portfolio assessments  loans are put on the watch list if deteriorating performance indicates they warrant a higher degree of monitoring and senior management attention 
as of december   we had loans on the watch list excluding non performing loans with an aggregate carrying value of million  or of the total carrying value of loans 
reserve for loan losses the reserve for loan losses was million as of december   or of the gross carrying value of total loans  down from billion or at december  the change in the balance of the reserve was the result of million of provisioning for loan losses  reduced by million of charge offs during the year ended december  the reserve is increased through the provision for loan losses  which reduces income in the period recorded and the reserve is reduced through charge offs 
due to the continued volatility of the commercial real estate market  the process of estimating collateral values and reserves continues to require us to use significant judgment 
we currently believe there is adequate collateral and reserves to support the carrying values of the loans 

table of contents the reserve for loan losses includes an asset specific component and a formula based component 
an asset specific reserve is established for an impaired loan when the estimated fair value of the loan collateral less costs to sell is lower than the carrying value of the loan 
as of december   we had asset specific reserves of million compared to billion at december  the decrease in the amount of asset specific reserves during the year ended december  was primarily due to the lower balance of non performing loans as discussed above 
the formula based general reserve is derived from estimated principal default probabilities and loss severities applied to groups of performing loans based upon risk ratings assigned to loans with similar risk characteristics during our quarterly loan portfolio assessment 
during this assessment we perform a comprehensive analysis of our loan portfolio and assign risk ratings to loans that incorporate management current judgments about their credit quality based on all known and relevant internal and external factors that may affect collectability 
we consider  among other things  payment status  lien position  borrower financial resources and investment in collateral  collateral type  project economics and geographical location as well as national and regional economic factors 
this methodology results in loans being segmented by risk classification into risk rating categories that are associated with estimated probabilities of default and principal loss 
we estimate loss rates based on historical realized losses experienced within our portfolio and take into account current economic conditions affecting the commercial real estate market when establishing appropriate time frames to evaluate loss experience 
the general reserve was million or of the gross carrying value of performing loans as of december   compared to million or of the gross carrying value of performing loans at december  the decrease in the balance of the general reserve resulted from the decrease in performing loans outstanding from billion as of december  to billion as of december   as well as a slight improvement of the weighted average risk ratings of performing loans outstanding during that same period 
real estate held for investment  net and other real estate owned rehi and oreo consist of properties acquired through foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure in full or partial satisfaction of non performing loans 
properties are designated as rehi or oreo depending on our strategic plan to realize the maximum value from the collateral received 
when we intend to hold  operate or develop the property for a period of at least months  assets are classified as rehi  and when we intend to market these properties for sale in the near term  assets are classified as oreo 
as of december  we had million of assets classified as rehi and million as oreo 
during the year ended december   we recorded impairment charges of million on oreo assets due to changing market conditions 
the continued volatility of the commercial real estate market requires us to use significant judgment in estimating fair values of rehi and oreo properties at the time of transfer and thereafter when events or circumstances indicate there may be a potential impairment 
additionally  we will continue to incur holding and operating costs related to rehi and oreo assets while they are being marketed for sale or redeveloped and repositioned 
the aggregate net operating and holding costs for rehi and oreo assets was million for the year ended december

table of contents concentrations of credit risks arise when a number of borrowers or customers related to our investments are engaged in similar business activities  or activities in the same geographic region  or have similar economic features that would cause their ability to meet contractual obligations  including those to us  to be similarly affected by changes in economic conditions 
we monitor various segments of our portfolio to assess potential concentrations of credit risks 
we believe the current portfolio is reasonably well diversified and does not contain any significant concentration of credit risks 
substantially all of our net lease  rehi and oreo assets  as well as assets collateralizing our loans and other lending investments are located in the united states  with california  new york  and florida representing the only significant concentrations greater than as of december  our portfolio contains significant concentrations in the following asset types as of december  apartment residential  land  retail and office 
we underwrite the credit of prospective borrowers and customers and often require them to provide some form of credit support such as corporate guarantees  letters of credit and or cash security deposits 
although our loans and other lending investments  net lease  rehi and oreo assets are geographically diverse and the borrowers and customers operate in a variety of industries  to the extent we have a significant concentration of interest or operating lease revenues from any single borrower or customer  the inability of that borrower or customer to make its payment could have an adverse effect on us 
as of december   our five largest borrowers or tenants of net lease assets collectively accounted for approximately of our aggregate annualized interest and operating lease revenue  of which no single customer accounts for more than 
liquidity and capital resources in march  we entered into a billion senior secured credit facility and used the proceeds to repay billion of outstanding borrowings under our existing secured credit facilities  which were due to mature in june and june proceeds were also used to repay million of our unsecured credit facilities due in june we expect to use the remaining proceeds to repay unsecured debt maturing in the first half of as well as for other corporate purposes 
in addition  during the first quarter of  we repaid the remaining million principal amount of unsecured senior notes due march and completed the redemption of our remaining million principal amount of senior secured notes due june after giving effect to these transactions  we will have approximately million of debt maturing and minimum required amortization payments due on or before december  see subsequent events below 
as of december   we had million of unrestricted cash 
our capital sources in the coming year will primarily include loan repayments and proceeds from strategic asset sales and planned oreo sales 
during  we expect to use these proceeds to supplement operating revenues in order to repay our debt obligations and to fund loan commitments  investment activities and operating expenses  including costs to reposition our oreo and rehi assets 
we believe that our available cash and expected proceeds from asset repayments and sales will be sufficient to meet our obligations during the remainder of the year 
however  the timing and amounts of proceeds from asset repayments and sales are subject to factors outside our control and cannot be predicted with certainty 
other capital sources which may be available to us in today financing environment include secured and unsecured financings and possibly other capital raising transactions 
we actively manage our liquidity and continually work on initiatives to address both our liquidity needs and compliance with the covenants in our debt instruments 
our plans are dynamic and we may adjust our plans in response to changes in our expectations and changes in market conditions 
we would be materially adversely affected if we were unable to repay or refinance our debt as it comes due 
since the beginning of  we have simplified our capital structure through reductions in debt of billion and through the retirement of the billion a participation associated with the acquisition 
table of contents of the fremont portfolio 
during the past three years we funded billion in loan commitments related to our portfolio 
we experienced reductions in available liquidity throughout and while economic conditions impacted our borrowers ability to repay their loans to us and our access to the unsecured debt markets was limited 
as a result  our sources of capital were derived primarily from asset sales and financings that were collateralized by the diverse assets in our portfolio 
as real estate market conditions improved during  loan repayments and asset monetizations increased  providing us with the additional liquidity to prepay outstanding indebtedness and reduce leverage 
during  we generated a total of billion in proceeds from our portfolio 
this included billion in gross loan principal repayments  million in loan sales and million from sales of oreo 
we also generated proceeds from sales of net lease assets of billion  including from the sale of a portfolio of net lease assets during the second quarter of  which resulted in a gain of million 
these proceeds were used in part to reduce our debt obligations by billion and also to fully retire the remaining million a participation associated with the acquisition of the fremont portfolio 
additionally  we funded a total of million in new and pre existing investments  including million in loan fundings and our million investment in lnr 
we also paid preferred dividends totaling million during the year

credit facilities in march  we entered into a new billion senior secured credit agreement and used a portion of the proceeds to fully repay billion outstanding under our existing secured credit facilities  described below  which were due to mature in june and june see subsequent events below 
prior to the repayment of the secured credit facilities  as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million and million of revolving loans maturing in june and june  respectively  as well as billion and million of term loans maturing in june and june  respectively 
borrowings under the secured credit facilities bore interest at the rate of libor per year  subject to adjustment based upon our corporate credit ratings see ratings triggers below 
as of december   the total carrying value of assets pledged as collateral under the secured credit facilities was billion 
these assets also served as collateral for million principal amount of senior secured notes due  which we redeemed in january see subsequent events below 
as of december   we had two unsecured revolving credit facilities  with outstanding balances of million maturing in june and million maturing in june borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facilities bear interest at a rate of libor per year  subject to adjustment based upon our corporate credit ratings see ratings triggers below 
we intend to use the remaining proceeds from the new secured credit facility and other cash on hand to repay the unsecured facility maturing in june in november  we fully repaid a billion first priority credit agreement  which was due to mature in june  and terminated all commitments thereunder 
other secured term loans also during  we repaid other secured term loans  including a million non recourse loan that was collateralized by the portfolio of net lease assets that was sold  as well as million of other term loans with various maturities 

table of contents in connection with these repayments  we expensed unamortized deferred financing costs and incurred other expenses totaling million  which reduced our net gain on early extinguishment of debt during the year ended december  secured notes also during  we redeemed or repurchased million of our second priority senior secured notes due and million of our second priority senior secured notes due  generating million of gains on early extinguishment of debt  primarily related to the recognition of the deferred gain premiums that resulted from our note exchanges completed in may subsequent to year end  we fully redeemed our million remaining principal amount of senior secured notes due june see subsequent events 
unsecured notes during the year ended december   we repurchased million par value of our senior unsecured notes with various maturities ranging from march to march through open market repurchases  generating million in gains on early extinguishment of debt 
we also repaid million of unsecured notes at maturity during the year ended december  debt covenants our outstanding unsecured debt securities contain covenants that include fixed charge coverage and unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness ratios 
the fixed charge coverage ratio in our debt securities is an incurrence test 
while we expect that our ability to incur new indebtedness under the coverage ratio will be limited for the foreseeable future  we will continue to be permitted to incur indebtedness for the purpose of refinancing existing indebtedness and for other permitted purposes under the indentures 
the unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness covenant is a maintenance covenant 
if any of our covenants is breached and not cured within applicable cure periods  the breach could result in acceleration of our debt securities unless a waiver or modification is agreed upon with the requisite percentage of the bondholders 
based on our unsecured credit ratings  the financial covenants in our debt securities  including the fixed charge coverage ratio and maintenance of unencumbered assets to unsecured indebtedness ratio  are currently operative 
our new secured credit facility see subsequent events below contains certain covenants  including covenants relating to the delivery of information to the lenders  collateral coverage  dividend payments  restrictions on fundamental changes  transactions with affiliates and matters relating to the liens granted to the lenders 
in particular  we are required to maintain collateral coverage of x outstanding borrowings 
in addition  for so long as we maintain our qualification as a reit  the new facility permits us to distribute of our reit taxable income on an annual basis 
we may not pay common dividends if we cease to qualify as a reit

critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported as assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures intended to ensure that valuation methods  including any judgments made as part of such methods  are well controlled  reviewed and applied consistently from period to period 
we base our estimates on historical corporate and industry experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be appropriate under the circumstances

during  management reviewed and evaluated these critical accounting estimates and believes they are appropriate
