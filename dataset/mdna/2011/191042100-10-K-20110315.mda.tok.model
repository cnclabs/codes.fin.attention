increase decrease in thousands business segment net sales pre tax income loss net sales pre tax income loss net sales pre tax income loss cobra ppl total company cobra business segment net sales for the cobra segment grew in by million  or percent  to million from million in this growth was attributable primarily to a percent increase in sales of citizens band radios domestically  as well as an percent increase in sales at ceel 
the strong increase in citizens band radio sales reflected strong sales of the new patented lx le  which has a revolutionary new design and new features for the professional driver  as well as the positive effect of an improving economy on truck shipments and discretionary spending by professional drivers at travel centers 
the increase in ceel sales was due to strong sales of radar detectors into russia and the united arab emirates 
partially offsetting these increases was a percent decline in sales of radar detection domestically  due mainly to a combination of two less models at a major retailer and  for several major retailers  a shift in purchases to lower priced models or an overall reduction in spending on the category because of the negative effect of high unemployment on discretionary spending by cost conscious consumers 
cobra s gross profit increased million in to million from million  while gross margin improved to percent from percent  in the improvement in gross margin was due to gross margin increases in the domestic business and at ceel 

table of contents domestically  gross margin increased as a result of both a more favorable product mix  because of the strong growth in citizens band radio sales and higher gross margin for two way radios because of decreases in air freight expense and the cost of pricing programs that were required in to maintain sales volume in the difficult economy 
partially offsetting this improvement in domestic gross margin was a lower radar detection gross margin because of an unfavorable product mix as sales of lower price point  lower margin models increased at several major retailers 
ceel s gross margin rose because of a favorable product mix  as the percentage of sales of radar detectors  a high margin category  increased while the percentage of sales of pmr two way radios  a low margin category  decreased 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in the cobra segment decreased million  or percent  to million in from million in  and  as a percentage of sales  declined to percent from percent 
much of the decrease was in fixed sg a expenses  which declined million  mainly as result of lower discretionary spending for trade shows  media  public relations and professional fees as management focused on containing these expenses 
also contributing to the decrease in sg a expense was lower variable selling expense due to an increase in the reversal of unused accrued marketing program funds from prior years and lower costs for a major customer because it was switched earlier in the current year to a low price  low program arrangement with net contribution essentially flat 
interest expense for was  higher than last year mainly due to the write off of deferred loan fees in other income for was  less than due to the decrease in csv income from last year 
as a result of the above  the cobra segment generated pre tax income of million for compared to a pre tax loss of million for performance products limited business segment ppl s net sales increased million  or percent  to million in from million in on a local currency basis  ppl net sales increased percent in compared to the prior year 
the sales increase was attributable to higher sales of satellite navigation and outdoor leisure products  offset in part by lower sales for tracking devices and download fees 
gross profit increased  to million in from million in gross margin was percent for compared to percent for the gross margin decline was due to a decrease in download revenue to percent of net sales in from percent in  exchange losses and inventory write downs 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased  to million in from million in and  as a percentage of sales  were percent in and percent in the  increase in sg a expenses was due to higher legal fees  marketing and sales expenses as well as payroll because of a headcount addition 
other income decreased  to  in compared to  in and was due to a lower foreign exchange gain recorded in compared to as a result of the above  the ppl segment generated a pre tax loss of  for compared to a pre tax income of  for income taxes for the year ended december   the company reported a  tax benefit compared to the million tax expense for the year ago period 
the  tax benefit was comprised of a  tax benefit due to us tax refunds received in  a  tax expense for the pre tax earnings in ireland and a  deferred tax benefit in the uk 
the uk tax benefit was due to a return to provision true up for the return  the prospective reduction to a percent tax rate for deferred taxes and book to tax timing differences 
the tax expense included million tax valuation allowance charge for a full valuation allowance established for the company s us operation in the second quarter of until the more likely than not realization criteria can be satisfied  the company will not report a us tax benefit for future pre tax losses or a us tax expense for future pre tax income 
the valuation allowance does not affect tax reporting for ceel and ppl as each is a separate non us tax jurisdiction 
beginning in  the company intended to repatriate the future earnings of its irish subsidiary ceel  which would have increased the company s effective tax on these earnings to reflect the higher us tax rate once the prior year s net operating loss is utilized and the valuation allowance is reversed 
ceel generated an operating loss for  and accordingly no funds were repatriated to the united states 
in  ceel generated an operating profit and accordingly deferred taxes were provided in the united states for the un repatriated earnings 

table of contents results of operations compared to the following table contains sales and pre tax income loss after eliminating intercompany accounts by business segment for the years ended december  and vs increase decrease in thousands business segment net sales pre tax income loss net sales pre tax income loss net sales pre tax income loss cobra ppl total company cobra business segment net sales of the cobra segment decreased in by million  or percent  to million from million in sales were adversely affected by the economic conditions that resulted in reduced store traffic  reduced consumer spending for discretionary items and the consumer preference for lower price point items 
lower domestic sales made up much of the decline  with citizens band radio and detection sales declining percent and percent  respectively 
the decline in citizens band radios reflected the recession s negative impact on freight traffic  which fell markedly resulting in a reduction in the disposable income of professional drivers and directly impacting sales of citizens band radios  especially those at higher price points 
detection sales declined not only because of reduced demand by consumers and their switch to purchases of lower price point models but also because of a store count reduction by a major retailer  the decision by a major retailer not to repeat a radar promotion with any vendor in and the bankruptcy and liquidation of circuit city in  which accounted for more than percent of radar detection sales in partially offsetting these declines were strong sales of the new mobile navigation product for the professional driver and an percent increase in sales of two way radios because of an exclusive supply agreement with a major retailer 
international sales  mainly two way radios and detection products to canada and europe  were down percent due to the adverse economic conditions in these markets 
cobra s gross profit decreased to million in from million in while the gross margin was percent and percent in and  respectively 
margin declines were experienced both domestically and in europe due primarily to an unfavorable sales mix as the recession caused consumers to become very price conscious and focus diminished discretionary spending on purchases of lower price point  lower margin products 
especially impacted were sales of domestic detection products as the average selling price in declined percent compared to the prior year 
the gross margin for domestic citizens band radios also experienced compression because of the shift in discretionary spending by price conscious professional drivers as unit sales of higher price point models sold to professional drivers fell over percent in compared to  a rate that was more than twice that of the decline in unit sales of lower price point models 
also contributing to the decrease in cobra s gross margin was a percent increase in certain sales promotion funds that are accounted for as a reduction in sales in order to help maintain sales in the difficult economy and the impact of the fixed components of the cost of sales being expensed across a lower level of sales  which combined reduced gross margin by approximately one point 
lastly  a weaker euro  down percent compared to  reduced gross margin on sales in europe 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the cobra segment decreased million  or percent  to million in from million in and  as a percentage of net sales  were percent and percent in and  respectively 
approximately half of the decrease was due to lower variable selling costs because of the decline in sales while the remainder was due to lower fixed expenses  mainly resulting from cost savings measures implemented by management  including reductions in headcount and professional fees with these savings partially offset by  of severance expense 
included in the cobra segment pre tax loss was interest expense of million  which was an increase of  from  and other income of  compared to other expense of million in interest expense  excluding the amortization of loan fees  decreased as a result of a lower weighted average interest rate for compared to the million favorable swing in other income was due primarily to a  gain on the cash surrender value of life insurance in compared to a million loss on the cash surrender value of life insurance in the life insurance is owned by the company for the purpose of recovering the costs of deferred compensation programs for several current and former officers 
gains or losses arise because the investment vehicles in which the cash was invested moved approximately up or down in value in line with the overall financial markets 
as a result of the above  the cobra segment had a pre tax loss of million in compared to a pre tax loss of  in performance products limited business segment ppl s net sales decreased in by million  or percent  to million from million in substantially all of the decrease was due to a weakening of the british pound sterling relative to the dollar 

table of contents gross profit decreased to million in from million in while the gross margin was percent and percent in and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin was due in part to the impact of the weaker british pound sterling noted above 
also contributing to the decrease in gross margin was a large decrease in high margin aura database sales 
these fees declined as a result of an increase in the portion of sales made outside of the uk  where the consumer s purchase price includes unlimited downloads for competitive reasons  and higher sales of new products that do not use aura database downloads such as gps enabled handheld navigation units designed for the outdoor enthusiast  which are available under the snooper brand as well as various third party brands and provide skiers  runners  hikers and others with maps of trails and a record of their activities 
the shift in sales made outside of the uk reflected both the severity of the recession in the uk compared to other countries in europe and ppl s successful efforts in expanding its distribution channels beyond its uk core market 
additionally  in there was a large aura database sale for smartphones that was not repeated in air freight charges increased as ppl attempted to meet strong demand for its satellite navigation products  principally the truckmate product  a dedicated portable truck satellite navigation system for professional drivers 
selling  general and administrative expenses declined million  or percent  to million in compared to million in  and  as a percentage of net sales  were percent and percent  respectively 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was due mainly to the previously discussed weaker british pound sterling 
the company s low stock price in relation to book value triggered an impairment review as of december  of the million of goodwill associated with the ppl acquisition 
based on the year end reconciliation of the book value to market capitalization  an impairment charge  equal to the goodwill balance at december   was recorded in the fourth quarter of as a result of the above  the ppl segment had pre tax income of  in compared to a pre tax loss of million in income taxes for  there was a tax provision of million compared to a tax provision of  for during the second quarter of  management concluded that a deferred tax valuation allowance was required for its us operation 
this conclusion was based on the fact that the us operation had sustained cumulative losses over the past three years  was forecasted to have a loss in because of the recession and had no tax planning strategies available that  if implemented  would generate taxable income sufficient for the us operation to realize in full its net deferred tax assets within a reasonable time horizon absent a turnaround in the business 
accordingly  the company recorded a charge of million for a valuation allowance in the second quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a tax benefit of million primarily for the valuation allowance release related to a federal tax refund of  resulting from a provision in the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of  enacted november   which allows eligible businesses a one time election to carry back net operating losses from or but not both for three  four or five years rather than the standard two years 
for the company s remaining deferred tax valuation allowance  until the more likely than not realization criteria can be met  the company will not report a us tax benefit for any future pre tax losses or a us tax provision for any future pre tax income 
this does not affect tax reporting for ceel and ppl as each of these is in a separate  non us tax jurisdiction 
beginning in  the company intended to repatriate the future earnings of its irish subsidiary ceel  which would have increased the company s effective tax on these earnings to reflect the higher us tax rate once the prior year s net operating loss is utilized and the valuation allowance is reversed 
however  since ceel generated an operating loss for  no funds were repatriated to the us in liquidity and capital resources the company refinanced its bank debt in july and replaced a million revolving asset based facility and a million term loan with a million revolving asset based facility 
this new credit agreement provides a lower cost credit facility and greater liquidity due to the borrowing base formula 
refer to note financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for additional information 
working capital requirements are seasonal  with demand for working capital being higher later in the year as customers begin purchasing for the holiday selling season 
the company believes that cash generated from operations and from borrowings under its credit agreement will be sufficient in to fund its working capital needs 
at december   the company had interest bearing debt outstanding of million and availability was approximately million under the revolving credit line based on the borrowing base formula 
absent a waiver from lenders  a failure to comply with the covenants in the credit agreement could result in any outstanding indebtedness under the credit agreement becoming immediately due and payable and the inability to borrow additional funds under the credit agreement 
net cash flows provided by operating activities for the year ended december  totaled million  compared to the million of net cash provided by operating activities in significant net cash inflows from operations and non cash add backs included net earnings of million  depreciation and amortization totaling million and income tax refunds of million 
these cash inflows were partially offset by a million increase in inventory  a million decrease in payables  a million increase in other assets and a  increase in non current assets 

table of contents million of the depreciation and amortization related to the cobra segment in included million of intangible asset amortization   of fixed asset depreciation  and  of prepaid amortization  mainly for packaging and outside design 
for the ppl segment  depreciation and amortization amounted to million in and included  of amortization for intangibles and other assets  which resulted from the allocation of the purchase price  and  of fixed asset depreciation 
the increase in inventories was mainly due to unfavorable variation from forecast  mainly in the uk  for fourth quarter sales 
the decrease in payables was due to reduced trade payables in the uk due to the timing of purchases and payments 
the increase in other assets was mainly due to deferred loan fees  prepayments and vendor receivables 
the increase in non current assets was due to product software  trademarks  patents and internet design expenditures 
cash used in investing activities totaled million in capital expenditures  mainly building and leasehold improvements and tooling  totaled million while life insurance premiums totaled  net cash provided by financing activities in totaled  as the result of additional bank borrowings 
contractual commitments the payments for the company s contractual commitments at december  were as follows total less than year to years to years after years in thousands capital lease operating leases purchase obligations a employment agreement obligations obligations under fin deferred compensation revolving loan b total a purchase obligations include commitments to purchase goods or services of either a fixed or minimum quantity including open purchase orders of  b includes interest of  for the revolving loan due under the credit agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the application of certain of these policies requires significant judgments or a historical based estimation process that can affect the results of operations and financial position of the company as well as the related footnote disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes are reasonable 
if actual amounts ultimately differ from previous estimates  the revisions are included in the company s results of operations for the period in which the actual amounts become known 
critical accounting policies generally consist of those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions 
the accounting policies and estimates that may have a significant impact upon the operating results  financial position and footnote disclosures of the company are as follows revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of goods is recognized at the time of shipment  except for revenue from sales of products to certain customers whose contractual terms specify fob destination 
revenue from sales of products to these customers is recognized at the estimated time of receipt by the customer when title and risk of loss would pass to the customer 
obligations for sales returns and allowances and product warranties are recognized at the time of sale on an accrual basis as described in the policies for sales returns reserve and warranty reserve 
the company bundles aura database subscriptions with certain detection and navigation products and sells these products to customers in transactions accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
the revenue associated with the sale of the aura database is deferred and recognized into income over the applicable subscription period  while the revenue associated with the detection and navigation products is recognized at the date of sale 
sales returns reserve 
the company has a policy that allows its customers to return product that was returned to them by their customers 
the reserve reflects the sales  cost of sales and gross profit impact of expected returns and related stock adjustments  as well as reduction in accounts receivable and increases in inventory for the amount of expected returns 
the amount of the reserve is determined by multiplying the sales and cost of sales by product category for the current quarter by historical return rates adjusted for any known changes in key variables affecting these return rates 
thus  judgments must be made regarding whether current return rates will approximate anticipated return rates 
this reserve will vary based on the changes in sales  gross margin and historical  as well as anticipated  return rates from quarter to quarter 

table of contents warranty reserve 
the company provides a warranty for its products and also allows its customers to return product that has been returned by their customers 
consequently  the company maintains a warranty reserve  which reflects historical return rates by product category multiplied by the most recent six months of unit sales and the unit standard cost of each model 
the company uses the most recent six months of unit sales in its estimate  as historical experience indicates that most returns will occur within six months of the company s original sale date 
therefore  judgments must be made based on historical return rates and how the returned product will be disposed of by  either liquidation or return to vendors for credit on new purchases 
this reserve may vary based upon the level of sales and changes in historical return rates from quarter to quarter as well as estimated costs of disposal  either liquidation prices or the credit given by vendors 
liquidation reserve 
the company maintains a liquidation reserve representing the write down of returned product from our customers to its net realizable value 
returned inventory is either sold to various liquidators or returned to vendors for partial credit against similar  new models  this decision depends upon the estimated future demand for the models 
judgments are made as to whether various models are to be liquidated or returned to the vendor  taking into consideration the liquidation prices expected to be received and the amount of vendor credit 
the amount of the reserve is determined by comparing the cost of each unit returned to the estimated amount to be realized upon each unit s disposition  either from returning the unit to the vendor for credit towards the cost of new  similar product or liquidating the unit 
this reserve can fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter depending upon quantities of returned inventory on hand and the estimated liquidation price or vendor credit per unit 
net realizable value reserve 
the company maintains a net realizable value reserve to write down below cost  as necessary  certain inventory not previously sold to customers where it is determined that net realizable value is less than cost 
thus  judgments must be made about which slow moving  excess or non current models are to be included in the reserve and the estimated net realizable value of such model ie  the per unit price that it is estimated can be received in the marketplace if the model was sold 
this reserve will vary depending upon the specific models selected  the estimated net realizable value for each model and quantities of each model that are determined will be sold below cost from quarter to quarter 
advertising and sales promotion accrual 
the advertising and sales promotion accrual reflects amounts provided to retailers and distributors for advertising and sales promotions 
customer programs  generally agreed to at the beginning of each year  are mainly variable programs dependent on sales and may be revised during the course of the year  based upon a customer s projected sales and other factors  such as new promotional opportunities 
accruals are made monthly for each customer by multiplying the customer s estimated program accrual percentage by the customer s actual sales 
therefore  this accrual will vary quarter to quarter depending on a given quarter s sales and the sales mix of customers 
in addition  should a customer significantly exceed or fall short of its planned program sales  negotiate changes to the term of the existing programs or add new ones  adjustments may need to be made to the customer s estimated program accrual percentage due to certain minimum and or maximum sales thresholds in such customer s programs 
periodic adjustments may also be necessary for unused customer funds 
deferred compensation 
obligations under the deferred compensation plans which are non qualified defined benefit plans and annual deferred compensation expense are determined by a number of assumptions 
key assumptions in the determination of obligations under the deferred compensation plans and annual deferred compensation expense include the discount rate and anticipated compensation for each individual covered by the plans  which in part is dependent upon the anticipated future profitability of the company 
the discount rate for and was percent 
the compensation increase assumptions are based on historical experience and anticipated future performance 
the company maintains life insurance policies for certain current and former executives to provide funding for future obligations 
software related to products to be sold 
the company purchases and or incurs costs in connection with the development of software to be used in products that the company intends to sell  mainly mobile navigation products 
coding and related costs incurred after technological feasibility of the software has been established and a working model of the product developed are capitalized and deferred as intangible assets 
capitalized costs are charged to earnings based on the ratio of actual product sales during the reporting period to expected product sales over the estimated product life cycle 
software related intangible assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date for possible impairment 
if such review indicates that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  the carrying amount is reduced to the estimated fair value 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company evaluates goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or if impairment indicators exist 
for goodwill  the evaluation requires a comparison of estimated fair value of ppl reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit 
if the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit  the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is reduced to its implied fair value through an adjustment to the goodwill balance  resulting in an impairment charge 
the fair values used in the impairment evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections and comparisons with comparable companies as well as the company s market capitalization 
due to the company s low market capitalization at december   a goodwill impairment evaluation indicated that the entire goodwill balance was impaired and resulted in a fourth quarter charge of million 
intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an amortizable intangible asset may not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators exist for an amortizable intangible asset  the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the expected service potential of the asset are compared 
table of contents to the carrying value of the asset 
if the projection of undiscounted future cash flows is in excess of the carrying value of the intangible assets  no impairment charge is recorded 
if the projection of undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the intangible asset  an impairment charge is recorded to reduce the intangible asset to its fair value 
income taxes 
deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the enacted tax laws for each applicable tax jurisdiction 
the deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year and the effect of enacted tax rate changes 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which the company operates  estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning and strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria 
due to the operating results for  the expected continuation of a global recession and the absence of tax planning strategies to generate a sufficient level of taxable income  management concluded the full realization of the deferred tax assets within a reasonable time horizon did not satisfy the more likely than not realization criteria 
accordingly  the company established a full deferred tax valuation allowance for its us operation in the company maintained the full valuation allowance for its us operation throughout the valuation allowance is a non cash charge that does not preclude the company from fully realizing the net deferred tax assets in the future 
at december  the deferred tax valuation allowance totaled million 
we recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally subject to us income taxation on repatriation to the united states 
through  the company had not recorded deferred income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its irish subsidiary totaling million because the company intended to indefinitely reinvest such earnings 
beginning in  the company intended to repatriate the future earnings of its irish subsidiary ceel  which will increase the company s effective tax on these earnings to reflect the higher us tax rate once the prior year s net operating loss is utilized and the valuation allowance is reversed 
ceel generated an operating loss for  and accordingly no funds were repatriated to the united states 
ceel generated an operating profit in and accordingly deferred taxes were provided in the united states for the un repatriated earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange risks and interest rates are inherent to the company s operations 
changes to these factors could cause fluctuations in the company s net earnings  cash flows and the fair values of financial instruments subject to market risks 
the company identifies these risks and when appropriate mitigates the financial impact with hedging and interest rate swaps 
debt incurred under a revolving loan agreement with a balance of million as of december  is priced at an interest rate that floats with the market 
therefore  the fair value of this debt is not significantly affected by changes in the interest rate market 
a basis point movement in the floating debt rate would result in approximately a  increase or decrease in interest expense and cash flows 
the company s suppliers are located in china  hong kong and south korea 
the company historically has negotiated substantially all of its purchases in us dollars and  in the case of ppl  occasionally uses forward contracts to purchase dollars at a fixed exchange rate to the british pound sterling 
the company considers opportunities to make purchases in other currencies  such as euros  to the extent that doing so would be advantageous in light of currency fluctuations involving the us dollar and other currencies 
in  approximately percent of the company s sales were outside the united states  principally in europe and canada  compared to percent in future fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could materially affect operating results 
the company minimizes the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with relationships outside of the united states by conducting nearly all of its transactions in us dollars  except for some billings of its european business  which are conducted in euros and the billings of ppl which are primarily in british pound sterling 
the company does not use derivative financial or commodity instruments for trading or speculative purposes  however  forward contracts are used occasionally for hedging a portion of the company s european business euro denominated transactions
