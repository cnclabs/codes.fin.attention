the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained herein and the notes thereto  along with the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates  set forth below 
overview we operate primarily in the in vitro diagnostic business 
our business principally involves the development  manufacture  marketing and sale of oral fluid diagnostic products and specimen collection devices using our proprietary oral fluid technologies  as well as other diagnostic products including immunoassays and other in vitro diagnostic tests that are used on other specimen types 
we also manufacture and sell other medical devices used for the removal of benign skin lesions by cryosurgery  or freezing 
our diagnostic products include tests which are performed on a rapid basis at the point of care and tests which are processed in a laboratory 
these products are sold in the united states and internationally to various clinical laboratories  hospitals  clinics  community based organizations and other public health organizations  distributors  government agencies  physicians offices  and commercial and industrial entities 
one of our products is sold in the otc or consumer retail market in north america  europe  central and south america  and australia 
in vitro diagnostic testing is the process of analyzing oral fluid  blood  urine and other bodily fluids or tissue for the presence of specific substances or markers for infectious diseases  drugs of abuse or other conditions 
we have targeted the use of oral fluid in our products as a differentiating factor and believe that it provides a significant competitive advantage over blood and urine 
our oral fluid tests have sensitivity and specificity comparable to blood and or urine tests 
when combined with their ease of use  non invasive nature  and cost effectiveness  our oral fluid tests represent a very competitive alternative to the more traditional testing methods in the diagnostic space 
we rely heavily on distributors to purchase and resell many of our products 
for example  genomma labs has exclusive rights to our wart removal product in the otc market in mexico  argentina  brazil  and various other central and south american countries and reckitt benckiser has similar rights to our wart removal product in the otc footcare market in europe  australia and new zealand 
we have contracted with several distributors to sell our oraquick advance hiv test to the us physician office market and our intercept and orasure product lines are sold by several laboratory distributors 
we use distributors to sell our histofreezer product into the domestic and international physician office markets 
we expect to enter into additional distribution agreements for existing and future products in the us and internationally 
if our distributors are unable or unwilling to meet the minimum purchase commitments set forth in their agreements or otherwise substantially reduce the volume of their purchases  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
because of the regulatory approvals needed for most of our products  we often are required to rely on sole source providers for critical components and materials and on related products supplied by third parties 
this is particularly true for our oraquick advance hiv test  our oraquick hcv test  our orasure oral fluid collection device and our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory product 
if we are unable to obtain necessary components or materials from these sole sources  the time required to develop replacements and obtain the required fda approvals could disrupt our ability to sell the affected products 
competitive and economic outlook competition in the market for hiv testing is intense and is expected to increase 
we believe that our principal competition will come from existing point of care rapid blood tests  laboratory based blood tests  and urine assays or other oral fluid based tests that may be developed 
our competitors include medical diagnostic companies and specialized biotechnology firms  as well as pharmaceutical companies with biotechnology divisions 
competing rapid blood tests are often sold at a lower price than we charge for our oraquick hiv test 
this competition can result in lost sales and degradation of the price and therefore the profit margin we can charge for our product 
our oraquick hcv test is now available in europe and is expected to compete against laboratory based hcv blood tests 
in non us countries outside of europe  we expect this product to compete against other rapid hcv blood tests and laboratory based tests 
we have received fda approval for use of the oraquick hcv test with venous whole blood specimens and fingerstick whole blood  and we expect this test to compete against laboratory based hcv blood tests in the us the recent economic downturn  including disruptions in the capital and credit markets  may continue for the foreseeable future and intensify 
these conditions have adversely affected and could continue to adversely affect our financial performance and condition or those of our customers and suppliers 
these circumstances could also adversely affect our access to liquidity needed to conduct or expand our business or conduct acquisitions or make other discretionary investments 
some of our customers rely on public funding provided by state and local governments  and this funding has been and may continue to be reduced or deferred as a result of current economic conditions 
these circumstances may also adversely impact our customers and suppliers  which  in turn  could adversely affect their ability to purchase our products or supply us with necessary equipment  raw materials or components 
in addition  demand for our products may also be adversely affected by the economic downturn 
current financial results during the year ended december   our total revenues were million  which represents a decrease from our net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  for the year ended december  our net loss in included a million pre tax charge for the impairment of patents and product rights and a million pre tax charge for the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit 
cash flow provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  an improvement when compared to the  used in operating activities for the year ended december  as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  and more recent developments oraquick hcv test in april  we commercially launched our oraquick rapid hcv antibody test in europe at a meeting of the european association for the study of the liver 
we have now begun selling the oraquick hcv test internationally  and we are currently pursuing additional registrations in a number of foreign countries 
our current focus is on finding distributors and building awareness of and acceptance for this product 
in june  our oraquick hcv test received fda approval for use in venous whole blood specimens  making it the first rapid hcv test approved by the fda 
we launched this product domestically at the annual meeting of the american association of clinical chemistry in july and we are actively selling this product to customers in the us during  we continued our efforts to obtain fda approval of additional applications for our oraquick hcv test 
a separate pma supplement was filed with the fda for fingerstick whole blood in july and was approved in february  making it the second application to be approved by the fda 
we intend to pursue approval of an oral fluid claim for our oraquick hcv test 
however  the filing of a pma supplement for oral fluid has been delayed pending the completion of additional testing and further discussions with the fda 
our protocols for a clia waiver have been reviewed and approved by the fda and our clia studies have been completed 
we intend to submit the results of our studies and request a clia waiver for our fingerstick whole blood and venous whole blood claims in the near future 
oraquick hiv test during the second quarter of  the fda approved a dating extension for our oraquick advance hiv test from to months 
we also received approval from our notified body to extend dating to months in europe 
in november  we received approval from the fda and in europe for an additional dating extension from to months 
real time stability studies are still in process for this product and  assuming the product continues to meet our stability criteria  we expect to seek approval of further shelf life extensions in the future 
also during the second quarter of  the automated manufacturing equipment we installed in our bethlehem  pennsylvania facility was validated and approved by the fda for use in the manufacture of our oraquick advance hiv test 
during the third quarter of  we commenced manufacturing our oraquick advance test with this equipment and we have begun to produce larger quantities of this product at a lower overall cost 
oraquick hiv otc test in the fourth quarter of  we completed our studies to validate the labeling for our oraquick hiv otc test  and in october we submitted to the fda our final label validation data and a request for an investigational device exemption ide for the final phase of clinical studies 
we were granted the ide in november and have begun the final phase of clinical testing  which consists of a study in which individuals will conduct unsupervised self testing using the investigational otc version of the oraquick hiv test with an oral fluid collection 
substance abuse testing in january  we signed an agreement with roche diagnostics for the worldwide commercialization of homogeneous  fully automated oral fluid drugs of abuse assays with our intercept oral specimen collection device 
the oral fluid assays are being jointly developed under a development agreement previously executed with roche 
the oral fluid assays are designed to run on various clinical chemistry automated analyzers  which is intended to allow oral fluid samples to be processed with the same efficiency currently provided by fully automated  urine based drug tests 
the commercialization agreement is structured to take advantage of each party s respective distribution strengths  including our established market presence with oral fluid testing and roche s established base of analyzers and broad marketing capabilities 
in the first quarter of  the fda issued k clearances for use of high throughput oral fluid assays for pcp  opiates  cocaine and methamphetamines with our intercept device 
these are the first such clearances resulting from our collaboration with roche diagnostics 
the fda is in the final stages of review for one other assay for amphetamines and we expect the fda to issue an additional k clearance for this product in the near future 
orasure quickflu test in the first quarter of  we added a new infectious disease testing product to our product portfolio 
the orasure quickflu rapid flu a b is an fda cleared in vitro rapid qualitative test for the detection of influenza type a and type b  including hn viral infections 
we expect to sell this product directly into the us hospital and public health markets 
an application for clia waiver has also been submitted to the fda for this product 
orasure quickflu is manufactured and supplied to us under our agreement with princeton biomeditech corporation 
results of operations year ended december  compared to december  total revenues decreased to million in from million in decreased sales in the infectious disease testing  substance abuse testing  and insurance risk assessment markets were partially offset by an increase in sales of our cryosurgical systems products and higher licensing and product development revenues 
revenues derived from products sold to customers outside the united states were million and million or and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as such  the impact of foreign currencies was not material to our operating results 
the table below shows the amount of our total revenues in thousands generated in each of our principal markets and by licensing and product development activities 
twelve months ended december  dollars change percentage of total revenues market infectious disease testing substance abuse testing cryosurgical systems insurance risk assessment product revenues licensing and product development total revenues infectious disease testing market as previously disclosed  an increasing number of our public health customers are supplying hospitals with oraquick advance hiv tests purchased from us 
this is a positive development as it indicates increased support of hospital testing initiatives by public health agencies 
however  this overlap is making it more difficult to separately track oraquick sales into these markets 
since this trend is likely to continue  we are now reporting public health and hospitals sales of our oraquick advance hiv test in the us as a combined domestic market 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
sales to the infectious disease testing market decreased to million in oraquick sales totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
sales of our orasure oral fluid collection device totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total oraquick revenues in thousands during and twelve months ended december  market change domestic international total oraquick revenues during  sales of the oraquick advance hiv test in the us market decreased or million  when compared to the same period in this decrease in revenue reflects lower sales volumes resulting from changes in ordering patterns of one of our larger public health customers and reduced public health funding by state and local governments  as well as a lower average selling price 
international sales of our oraquick hiv test decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from customer losses due to price competition  changes in the use of our test within government testing algorithms  and a decrease or elimination of funding for hiv testing initiatives 
sales of our orasure oral fluid collection device decreased from million in the to million in due to reduced public health funding by state and local governments 
in addition  some customers who have purchased our orasure device for laboratory hiv testing in the past are now electing to purchase our oraquick advance test 
we believe this is the result of customers recognizing the benefits of rapid hiv testing  especially with oral fluid 
substance abuse testing market as a result of declining economic conditions and consolidations in the laboratory industry  several of our laboratory customers are performing substance abuse testing for both the criminal justice and workplace testing markets 
as such  it is becoming increasingly difficult to track intercept revenues separately in these markets 
we expect this trend to continue and  accordingly  we are now reporting intercept sales to the us criminal justice and workplace testing markets on a combined basis 
prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
sales to the substance abuse testing market decreased in primarily as a result of lower sales of our intercept drug testing system and a decrease in laboratory equipment sales 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total intercept revenues in thousands generated in each market during and twelve months ended december  market change domestic international total intercept revenues domestic intercept revenues decreased and international revenues remained relatively flat for when compared to the prior year 
we do not expect renewed growth in intercept sales until employment conditions in the us recover and overall economic conditions improve 
in addition  the microplate oral fluid drug assays  which are sold for use with the intercept collection device  have come under increasing competitive pressure from home brew assays developed internally by our laboratory customers and compete with urine based homogeneous assays that are run on fully automated  random access analyzers 
we believe our competitors are developing oral fluid tests suitable for use on these fully automated homogeneous assay systems and these assays  if and when they are developed and commercialized  could represent a significant competitive threat to our oral fluid microplate business 
as discussed above  pursuant to a development agreement with roche diagnostics  homogenous fully automated oral fluid drugs of abuse assays are being developed for use with our intercept collection device 
the fda has issued k clearances on the high throughput assays for pcp  opiates  cocaine and methamphetamines and an application for k clearance of an amphetamines assay for use with the intercept device is currently pending before the fda 
the assays use roche s kims kinetic interaction of micro particles in solution technology and will run on various automated analyzers to allow oral fluid samples to be processed with the same efficiency currently achieved with urine based drug tests 
we have also entered into a commercialization agreement with roche pursuant to which a drug testing system comprised of our intercept device and the newly developed homogenous assays will be marketed and sold on a worldwide basis 
cryosurgical systems market sales of our products in the cryosurgical systems market which includes both the physicians office and otc markets increased to million in from million in the table below shows a breakdown of our total cryosurgical revenues in thousands generated in each market during and twelve months ended december  market change professional domestic professional international over the counter total cryosurgical systems revenues sales of our histofreezer product to physicians offices in the united states increased to million in  compared to million in  largely due to the elimination of the diversion of less expensive international histofreezer product into the domestic market 
in addition  in early  we signed agreements with two manufacturers sales representative organizations to support sales of our histofreezer product in the us under these arrangements  over additional sales representatives have been working with our physicians office distributors throughout the united states  resulting in additional domestic histofreezer sales growth during this year 
sales of histofreezer in the international market decreased in  compared to this decline was largely due to a discontinuance of sales to certain foreign distributors that we believe were diverting product to the us market 
the selling prices for our histofreezer product are lower in some foreign countries due to differences in the healthcare systems in those countries 
during and early  some distributors in these countries purchased english labeled histofreezer product and resold it into the domestic distribution network to distributors who employ alternate sourcing programs 
we also experienced a decline in histofreezer sales in the european market as a result of the negative impact of changing european health regulations 
in the european professional marketplace  healthcare reimbursement has been or may be reduced or eliminated for certain treatment types  including treatments for common warts 
the reduction in or elimination of reimbursement for wart treatments has affected international sales of our histofreezer product and will continue to do so 
during the year ended december   our otc cryosurgical sales decreased primarily due to decreased sales to our latin american otc distributor  genomma 
during  genomma increased its purchases to support the launch of our otc cryosurgical wart removal product in brazil 
we did not have this similar pipeline fill in  resulting in a decrease in sales to genomma of approximately  in july  ssl international ssl  our european otc distributor  was acquired by reckitt benckiser group plc 
our distribution contract with reckitt was subject to an annual renewal at the end of and was extended through march  we expect that an additional short term renewal will occur to permit the parties to negotiate a new distribution contract 
sales to reckitt for distribution in the european otc market were million in and  respectively 
during the first quarter of  we launched our own wart removal product under the freeze n clear skin clinic tm tradename into the us otc cryosurgical marketplace 
this venture resulted in limited revenues 
as a result of the product s limited success  competing priorities and limited corporate funding  management decided to end its participation in the us otc cryosurgical marketplace at the end of insurance risk assessment market sales to the insurance risk assessment market decreased from million in to million in  as some insurance companies abandoned pre screening for lower face value insurance policies 
we expect this trend to continue in licensing and product development licensing and product development revenues increased to million during from million during this increase was primarily due to million in milestone payments received as a result of our achievement of certain regulatory and commercial objectives pursuant to a collaboration agreement with merck for the development and promotion of our oraquick rapid hcv test in international markets 
the remaining licensing revenues for both and represent royalties received on domestic outsales of merck s otc cryosurgical wart removal product  pursuant to our license and settlement agreement executed in january gross margin the company s gross margin was in  compared to in the increase in gross margin in was primarily the result of the higher licensing and product development revenues 
operating expenses research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in  as a result of lower validation and clinical trial costs related to the development of our oraquick hcv test 
these decreases were partially offset by higher laboratory supplies expense related to the development of new infectious disease products and higher clinical trial costs related to the development of our oraquick hiv otc test 
we expect our research and development costs will increase in as we continue clinical trials for our hiv otc test and oraquick hcv product and develop other new products 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease was primarily the result of lower relocation expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease from levels as a result of lower staffing costs 
general and administrative expenses remained relatively unchanged at million in and lower legal expenses in were offset by an increase in consulting costs 
we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease slightly from levels as a result of expected reductions in staffing and consulting costs 
in november  we settled the patent infringement lawsuit filed by inverness medical and church dwight 
pursuant to the settlement we paid inverness million 
we recorded million of the million payment as litigation settlement expense in our statement of operations for the remaining million was recorded as prepaid royalties and is being expensed in cost of goods sold in relation to estimated oraquick advance hiv revenues to be generated through december  during the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to license payments for certain hcv patents  which we previously capitalized 
management s intent in capitalizing these payments was to utilize this license in certain developing countries for the marketing and sale of an existing rapid hcv test supplied by a third party manufacturer 
however  we were unable to penetrate this international marketplace with this third party s rapid hcv test 
furthermore  given the impact of the current global recession and the deteriorating status of certain third world economies  we no longer believed that we would be successful in selling this third party s rapid hcv test in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash impairment charge for the remaining unamortized book value of the patent and product rights in the quarter ended june  other income expense interest expense decreased to  in from  in interest income also decreased to  in from  in  primarily as a result of lower yields earned on our investment portfolio  lower investment balances  and an overall more conservative  shorter term investment approach 
income taxes in  we established a full valuation allowance against our total net deferred tax asset 
management has continued to evaluate whether the full valuation is still appropriate 
at december   we concluded that the full valuation allowance remained appropriate as the facts and circumstances since the establishment of the allowance had not changed 
as a result  no income tax benefit was recorded in in november  the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of was enacted 
this new law extended the carryback period for a net operating loss nol from two years up to a maximum of five years 
the carryback of the nol can be applied to both regular tax nols and alternative minimum tax amt nols 
the new law also eliminates the limitation on the use of any amt nols 
as a result of the elimination of the limitations  we elected to carryback our amt nol to our   and tax years and apply for a refund of the amt taxes paid for those years 
as such  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a  federal tax benefit associated with this amt nol carryback 
offsetting this benefit was a nominal amount of state income taxes 
year ended december  compared to december  total revenues increased to million in from million in revenues derived from products sold to customers outside the united states were million and million or of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as such  the impact of foreign currencies was not material to our operating results 
the table below shows the amount of our total revenues in thousands generated in each of our principal markets and by licensing and product development activities 
year ended december  dollars change percentage of total revenues market infectious disease testing substance abuse testing cryosurgical systems insurance risk assessment product revenues licensing and product development total revenues infectious disease testing market sales to the infectious disease testing market increased to million in  primarily as a result of our switch to a direct sales model for the us hospital market which allowed us to realize a higher average selling price for these customers 
higher volumes in the us public health market and higher international sales also contributed to the increase 
oraquick and orasure sales during totaled million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million in  respectively 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total oraquick revenues in thousands during and year ended december  customers change direct to us public health hospital market international total oraquick revenues during  oraquick sales to the us public health market increased by as compared to this increase was caused by higher purchase volumes due in part to the fact that a number of our hospital customers were procuring oraquick product through public health channels in lieu of purchasing the test directly from us 
we believed this pattern was the result of increased public health support of testing initiatives by hospitals across the country 
as a result  sales to the hospital market were being redirected to the us public health market  thereby increasing revenues within that customer category 
sales into the hospital market increased to million during  compared to million in in january  we switched to a direct sales model for us hospitals as a result of the termination of our distribution agreement with abbott laboratories at the end of the increase in revenues in the hospital market was primarily due to a higher average selling price realized under our direct sales model 
international sales of our oraquick test increased to million in from million in this increase reflected higher sales into latin america  europe and asia 
sales into africa remained flat at million in both and during  sales of orasure declined  from million in to million in some customers who had purchased our orasure device for laboratory hiv testing in the past are electing to purchase our oraquick advance test 
substance abuse testing market sales to the substance abuse testing market decreased in primarily as a result of lower sales of our intercept collection devices and oral fluid assays 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total intercept revenues in thousands generated in each market during and year ended december  market change workplace testing criminal justice international direct total intercept revenues our workplace testing business decreased from million in to million in pre employment drug screening represented over of our workplace testing business and the downturn in the domestic economy and high unemployment levels had a significant negative impact on this part of our business  as well as on our direct sales to small and mid size companies 
sales to the criminal justice market decreased from million in to million in  primarily as a result of the availability of competing lower priced drug testing products 
international sales of intercept devices and assays decreased to million in from million in  also as a result of competition from lower priced drug testing products outside of the us cryosurgical systems market sales of our products in the cryosurgical systems market which includes both the physicians office and otc markets increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily caused by higher sales to our latin american otc distributor  genomma  partially offset by lower sales to our european otc distributor  ssl  and decreased histofreezer sales in international professional markets 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total cryosurgery revenues in thousands generated in each market during and year ended december  market change professional domestic professional international otc domestic n a otc international total cryosurgical systems revenues sales to genomma for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to  during the year ended december  during  genomma reduced its purchases in response to an increase in product returns from retailers in mexico who overstocked during the winter months of throughout and early in  genomma worked through its excess inventory levels and resumed purchasing product during the second quarter of in addition  genomma launched our cryosurgical wart removal product in brazil and we completed our first shipment to brazil in september the increased sales to latin america were partially offset by a decrease in sales to ssl 
sales to ssl were million and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in revenues from ssl resulted from a reduction in the transfer price paid by ssl and a decrease in units purchased as a result of increased competition in the otc wart removal market in europe 
during the first quarter of  we reentered the us otc cryosurgery marketplace through the launch of our own cryosurgical wart removal product under our new national brand  freeze n clear skin clinic 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in revenues from freeze n clear skin clinic 
however  these revenues were offset by million in promotional rebates  advertising  slotting and return allowances provided to the retail trade  which we netted against the revenues in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
sales of our histofreezer product to physicians offices in the united states were million in both and sales of histofreezer in the professional international market decreased to million in  as compared to million in the selling prices for our histofreezer product are lower in some foreign countries due to differences in the healthcare systems in those countries 
during and early  some distributors in these countries purchased english labeled histofreezer product and resold it into the domestic distribution network to distributors who employ alternate sourcing programs 
although we tried to aggressively address this diversion issue  we believe it negatively impacted sales in the domestic physicians office market during the decline in histofreezer revenues in the professional international market in was largely due to a reduction of sales to distributors that we believe were diverting product to the us market 
insurance risk assessment market sales to the insurance risk assessment market increased from million in to million in  due to variations in laboratory ordering patterns and an increase in purchases of lower face value insurance policies for which insurers use our oral fluid screening device 
licensing and product development licensing and product development revenues decreased to million in  from million in in january  we entered into a license and settlement agreement with merck co 
inc merck  successor to schering plough in which merck agreed to pay us royalties on us sales of their freeze away tm otc cryosurgical wart removal product 
licensing revenues represent these royalties from merck in and gross margin the company s gross margin was in  compared to in gross margin was favorably impacted during primarily by our switch in january to a direct sales model for our oraquick advance hiv test in the us hospital market 
also contributing to the increase was an improvement in manufacturing efficiency in operating expenses research and development expenses decreased to million in  from million in  primarily as a result of decreased clinical trial spending for our oraquick hiv otc test and oraquick hcv test 
the majority of the initial product development and clinical costs associated with the oraquick hcv device and related pma submission was incurred during a decrease in staffing costs resulting from organizational changes made during the fourth quarter of also contributed to the current period decrease 
in addition  expenses in included a million patent license milestone payment required as a result of our filing of a pma submission with the fda for our oraquick hcv device  while expenses did not include any such payment 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in staffing costs increased in as a result of hiring a new sales force in support of our direct sales model for the us hospital market  as well as hiring  compensation  and relocation costs associated with new senior level sales and marketing personnel 
market research and consulting expenses related to our cryosurgical products also increased during these increases were offset by a decrease in reimbursement of distributor advertising expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to higher staffing costs as well as legal expenses associated with the patent infringement lawsuit related to our oraquick advance hiv test filed against us by inverness medical and church dwight 
in november  we settled the patent infringement lawsuit filed by inverness and church dwight 
pursuant to the settlement we paid inverness million 
we recorded million of the million payment as litigation settlement expense in our statement of operations for the remaining million was recorded as prepaid royalties and will be expensed in cost of goods sold in relation to oraquick advance hiv revenues generated through december  in the first quarter of  we received a payment of million as a result of the settlement of patent infringement litigation we had previously filed against merck 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to license payments for certain hcv patents  which we previously capitalized 
management s intent in capitalizing these payments was to utilize this license in certain developing countries for the marketing and sale of an existing rapid hcv test supplied by a third party manufacturer 
however  we were unable to penetrate this international marketplace with this third party s rapid hcv test 
furthermore  given the impact of the global recession and the deteriorating status of certain third world economies  we no longer believed that we would be successful in selling a third party s rapid hcv test in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash impairment charge for the remaining unamortized book value of the patent and product rights in the second quarter of other income expense interest expense increased to  in from  in interest income decreased to  in from million in primarily as a result of lower yields earned on our investment portfolio  lower investment balances  and an overall conservative  shorter term investment approach 
income taxes in november  the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of was enacted 
this new law extended the carryback period for nols from two years up to a maximum of five years 
the carryback of the nol can be applied to both regular tax nols and amt nols 
the new law also eliminates the limitation on the use of any amt nols 
as a result of the elimination of the limitations  we elected to carryback our amt nol to our   and tax years and apply for a refund of the amt taxes paid for those years 
as such  in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a  federal tax benefit associated with this amt nol carryback 
offsetting this benefit was a nominal amount of state income taxes 
during  we evaluated whether or not we would realize the benefits associated with our total net deferred tax asset in the future 
given the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and length of the current economic recession  our loss in  and our projection of a loss in  which would result in a net cumulative three year loss  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits associated with our net deferred tax assets in the immediate future 
accordingly  in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb guidance  we recorded an income tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of in order to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources december  in thousands cash and cash equivalents short term investments working capital our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million from million as of december  to million as of december   primarily as a result of million of cash flows from operations offset by million in payments for patents and product rights  million in property and equipment purchases   associated with the retirement of common stock to pay minimum tax withholding obligations on the vesting of restricted shares  and  for debt repayments 
our working capital declined primarily as a result of the classification of the remaining unpaid principal balance of our debt obligation to a current liability as a result of its june maturity date 
during  operating activities provided cash of million 
cash provided by operating activities resulted primarily from the offset of our million net loss by non cash stock based compensation expense of million and depreciation and amortization of million 
also contributing to the cash provided by operating activities was a million decrease in accounts receivable resulting from the decrease in sales and the timely collection of amounts due  a million decrease in inventories largely as a result of managing our oraquick inventory to lower levels  and a million decrease in prepaid expenses largely due to the collection of a federal tax refund of  and the routine amortization of prepaid royalties 
offsetting these cash contributions was a decrease in accounts payable of  and a million decrease in accrued expenses and other liabilities associated with payment of our royalty obligations  management incentive bonuses and a decrease in deferred revenues 
net cash used in investing activities during was million 
proceeds of million from maturities and redemptions of short term investments were offset by million in purchases of property and equipment and million in payments for patents and licenses related to the achievement of milestones pursuant to our hcv patent license agreement 
during the year ended december   we expect to invest approximately million in capital expenditures  primarily to purchase additional equipment  upgrade certain older equipment and make improvements to our facilities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  primarily as a result of  in loan principal repayments and  used for the withholding and retirement of common stock related to the vesting of restricted shares 
as of december   we had in place a  credit facility with comerica bank comerica 
pursuant to the terms of the facility  principal  and interest fixed at per annum  are payable monthly through june  at which time the remaining unpaid principal balance is payable and the facility will expire 
accordingly  beginning on june   our remaining unpaid principal balance was classified as a current liability as it will be payable within the ensuing twelve months 
as of december   we had no available borrowings under this credit facility 
we are evaluating possible options to address the upcoming expiration of the facility  including refinancing with a new credit facility or other borrowings 
all borrowings from comerica are collateralized by a first priority security interest in all of our assets  including present and future accounts receivable  chattel paper  contracts and contract rights  equipment and accessories  general intangibles  investments  instruments  inventories  and a mortgage on our three facilities in bethlehem  pennsylvania 
the comerica agreement contains certain covenants that set forth minimum requirements for our quick ratio  liquidity  and tangible net worth 
we were in full compliance with all covenants as of december  the agreement also restricts our ability to pay dividends  to make certain investments  to incur additional indebtedness  to sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of assets  and to merge or consolidate operations with an unaffiliated entity  without the consent of comerica 
as of december   we had net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset generated by these nols 
the combination of our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments is expected to be more than sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs through at least the next twelve months 
our cash requirements  however  may vary materially from those now planned due to many factors  including  but not limited to  the scope and timing of strategic acquisitions  the cost and timing of the expansion of our manufacturing capacity  the progress of our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical testing  the cost of any future litigation  the magnitude of capital expenditures  changes in existing and potential relationships with business partners  the time and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents  proprietary rights and any necessary licenses  the cost and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of market launch of new products  market acceptance of new products  competing technological and market developments  the impact of the ongoing economic downturn and other factors

off balance sheet arrangements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k under the securities exchange act of  as amended 
critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue recognition  clinical trial accruals  contingencies and litigation 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we consider the following accounting estimates  which have been discussed with our audit committee  to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition 
we recognize product revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has passed and collection is reasonably assured 
product revenues are recorded net of allowances for any discounts or rebates 
we do not grant price protection or product return rights to our customers except for warranty returns and return rights granted to retail customers for our domestic cryosurgical wart removal product 
historically  returns arising from warranty issues have been infrequent and immaterial 
accordingly  we expense warranty returns as incurred 
for our cryosurgical product sold in the domestic retail market  a provision for estimated product returns is recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period in which the revenue is recognized 
in addition  revenue from domestic retail sales is also recorded net of promotional  advertising  and slotting allowances granted to the retail trade 
royalty income from the grant of license rights is recognized during the period in which the revenue is earned and the amount is determinable from the licensee 
product development revenues are recognized over the period in which the related product development efforts are performed 
amounts received prior to the performance of product development efforts are recorded as deferred revenues 
grant revenue is recognized as the related work is performed and costs are incurred 
we record shipping and handling charges billed to our customers as product revenue and the related expense as cost of products sold 
taxes assessed by governmental authorities  such as sales or value added taxes  are excluded from product revenues 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are reduced by an estimated allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
on an ongoing basis  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon the customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we also continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified  we use our judgment to establish and evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for estimated credit losses  which was  as of december  while credit losses have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  these losses can vary from period to period 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will experience credit losses at the same rates as we have in the past 
the current economic downturn  including disruptions in the capital and credit markets  may continue indefinitely and intensify  and could adversely affect the operations  cash flows and financial condition of our customers 
these circumstances may adversely impact the liquidity or financial position of our customers and could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we continually evaluate quantities on hand and the carrying value of our inventories to determine the need for reserves for excess and obsolete inventories based primarily on the estimated forecast of product sales 
when  in the opinion of management  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories carrying value or the inventories are completely written off  as in the case of lapsing expiration dates 
during  and  we wrote off inventory which had a cost of  million and million  respectively  as a result of quality  scrap and product expiration issues 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the carrying value of our inventories and reported operating results 
stock based compensation 
we recognize the fair value of equity based awards as compensation expense in our statement of operations 
the fair value of our stock option awards was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this valuation model s computations incorporate highly subjective assumptions  such as the expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of the options  after considering the effect of expected forfeitures  is then amortized  generally on a straight line basis  over the related vesting period of the option 
the fair value of our restricted shares is based on the market value of the shares at the date of grant and is recognized on a straight line basis over the related vesting period of the award 
long lived and intangible assets 
our long lived assets are comprised of property and equipment and our intangible assets primarily consist of patents and product rights 
together  these assets had a net book value of million  or of our total assets  as of december  property and equipment and patents and product rights are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which we determine based upon our estimate of the period of time over which each asset will generate revenues 
an impairment of long lived or intangible assets could occur whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of our assets may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger asset impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of an asset or in our overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and shortening of product life cycles or changes in technology 
if we believe impairment of an asset has occurred  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the net book value of the affected assets to the fair value of these assets  which is generally determined based upon the present value of the expected cash flows associated with the use of these assets 
if the net book value exceeds the fair value of the impaired assets  we would incur an impairment expense equal to this difference 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to license payments for certain hcv patents  which were previously capitalized 
management s intent in capitalizing these payments was to utilize this license in certain developing countries for the marketing and sale of an existing rapid hcv test supplied by a third party manufacturer 
however  we were unable to penetrate this international marketplace with this third party s rapid hcv test 
furthermore  given the impact of the recent global recession and the deteriorating status of certain third world economies at that time  we no longer believed that we would be successful in selling a third party s rapid hcv test in the foreseeable future 
we currently believe the future cash flows to be received from all remaining long lived and intangible assets as of december  will exceed their book value 
we did not recognize any impairment losses for the years ended december  or any unanticipated significant impairment in the future  however  could have a material adverse impact to our balance sheet and future operating results 
deferred tax assets 
at december   we had federal nol carryforwards of million 
the deferred tax assets  before a full valuation allowance  associated with these nols and other temporary differences was million at december  in assessing the realizability of net deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our ability to realize our net deferred tax asset  in order to determine if a valuation allowance should be recorded against it pursuant to fasb accounting guidance 
a cumulative loss in recent years is a significant piece of negative evidence to be considered when evaluating the need for a valuation allowance and this evidence is difficult to overcome 
given the uncertainty surrounding the magnitude and length of the economic recession at that time  our loss in  and our projection of a loss in  which would result in a net cumulative three year loss  we determined that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits associated with our net deferred tax asset in the immediate future 
accordingly  we recorded an income tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
during and  we continued to reevaluate our valuation allowance position and believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred income tax asset will not be realized in the immediate future 
as such  we maintain a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of december  and our ability to use our nol carryforwards to offset future federal income tax obligations could be limited by changes in the ownership of our stock 
internal revenue code irc section contains provisions that limit the amount of federal nol carryforwards that can be used in any given year in the event of specified occurrences  including significant ownership changes 
during the fourth quarter of  the company completed an analysis  with the assistance of independent tax specialists  to determine if any irc section ownership changes had occurred that would limit the amount of nols that could be utilized to offset future taxable income 
as a result of this analysis  the company concluded that prior period ownership changes may impose a limitation on the amount of nols that can be utilized in a given year 
the company does not believe  however  that this limitation will impair our future ability to utilize nols to offset our future taxable income 
the company continues to review ownership changes on an annual basis and we have not had an ownership change that would impact the nols 
clinical trial accruals 
some of our research and development is conducted by third parties  including contract research and development service providers 
all such costs are charged to research and development expense systematically as incurred  which may be measured by patient enrollment or the passage of time 
at the end of each quarter  we compare the payments made to each service provider to the estimated progress toward completion of the research or development objectives 
such estimates are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
depending on the timing of payments to the service providers and the estimated service provided  we record net prepaid or accrued expense relating to these costs 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  distributors  research laboratories and universities  licensors  licensees  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  we could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships 
we record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires that we use our best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not hold any amounts of derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and  accordingly  we have no material derivative risk to report under this item 
the majority of our assets is comprised of cash and cash equivalents and as a result we have little exposure to market risks associated with available for sale securities 
in january  we elected to fix the interest rate on our long term debt at until the debt s maturity in june as a result  we have no exposure to interest rate changes 
as of december   we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts or purchase currency options to hedge local currency cash flows 
we have operations in europe and africa  which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of revenues and expenses for these operations from foreign currencies to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
sales denominated in a foreign currency were minimal compared to our total revenues for the year ended december  we do not expect the risk of foreign currency fluctuations to be material to us in the near future
