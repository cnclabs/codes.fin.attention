item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal year  net earnings per diluted share from continuing operations increased and total revenues increased over fiscal year including the effect of revenues recognized for the proton therapy system at the scripps proton therapy center with a zero profit margin discussed further below  fiscal year gross margin improved slightly and operating margin was relatively flat  compared with fiscal year in fiscal year  diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased from fiscal year primarily because we repurchased million shares of vms common stock during the year 
each of oncology systems  x ray products  sip and vpt reported growth in net orders in fiscal year from fiscal year at the end of fiscal year  our backlog increased from the end of fiscal year primary uses of cash in fiscal year included payments for stock repurchases  including amounts paid under accelerated repurchase agreements 
in fiscal year  we amended the revolving credit facility with bank of america  na to increase our borrowing capacity to million 
at the end of fiscal year  our cash and cash equivalents were million and our short term borrowings and long term debt totaled million 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded the proton therapy system order from cptc for the scripps proton therapy center in san diego  california and began recognizing revenues on this contract 
during fiscal year  we committed to loan up to million to cptc to finance the construction and startup operations of the scripps proton therapy center  under which commitment we had loaned million as of fiscal year end 
effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we classified research instruments as a discontinued operation for all periods presented in our consolidated statements of earnings 
including a net loss per diluted share from this discontinued operation  net earnings in fiscal year were per diluted share 
as of september   we had no remaining obligations related to research instruments  which was previously included in the other category 
unless otherwise stated  the discussion in this md a pertains to our continuing operations 
oncology systems 
our largest business segment is oncology systems  which designs  manufacturers  sells and services hardware and software products for radiation treatment of cancer with conventional radiotherapy  imrt  igrt  volumetric modulated arc therapy an advanced form of imrt  stereotactic radiotherapy  srs  sbrt and brachytherapy 
oncology systems net orders increased  or on a constant currency basis  in fiscal year over fiscal year reflecting increased net orders in both the international region and north america 
in fiscal year  oncology systems total revenues rose over fiscal year  with a increase in north america and a increase in the international region 
the truebeam system and the service contract business were significant contributors of growth in oncology systems net orders and revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year oncology systems gross margin increased percentage points in fiscal year over fiscal year due to increases in both service gross margin and higher proportion of product revenues from our truebeam system which carries a higher gross margin than our other linear accelerators 
in april  we received approval by the state food drug administration in china to market and sell our truebeam system in china 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we received shonin approval from the japanese ministry of health  labor and welfare to market the truebeam system in japan 
through september   we had received orders for truebeam systems since its introduction  a majority of which came from north america 
a minority of these orders represented upgrades from other linear accelerators already in our backlog 

table of contents demand for our oncology systems products is impacted in part by the strength and sustainability of an economic recovery in the united states  stability of sovereign debt in europe and the level of related austerity measures to control the sovereign debt crisis  as well as the slowdown of economic activities in faster growing regions  such as china 
in october  we acquired calypso  a privately held supplier of specialized products and software for real time tumor tracking and motion management during radiosurgery and radiotherapy 
the price was million plus potential contingent consideration if certain milestones are achieved 
this acquisition enables us to offer real time  non ionizing tumor tracking tools for enhancing the precision of cancer treatments 
we expect calypso will have a dilutive effect on our operating earnings in fiscal year in may  we signed an agreement with augmenix  a privately held company that is developing hydrogel products to decrease irradiation of radiation sensitive tissue such as the rectum through creating greater spatial separation between the sensitive tissue eg  rectum and the treated area eg  prostate during treatments  under which we paid million to augmenix for a minority equity interest plus an exclusive option to purchase the remaining equity interest if certain agreed upon milestones have been met 
in march  we acquired a privately held supplier of devices for delivery of brachytherapy treatment of cancer for approximately million 
x ray products 
our x ray products business segment  designs  manufactures and sells x ray tubes and flat panel detectors for use in a range of applications  including radiographic or fluoroscopic imaging  mammography  special procedures and industrial applications  and x ray tubes for use in computed tomography ct scanning 
in fiscal year  x ray products reported record net orders  revenues and operating earnings 
net orders and revenues increased and  respectively  in fiscal year over fiscal year both the flat and the x ray tube product lines contributed to the increase in net orders and revenues 
x ray products gross margin improved in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to higher sales volume  product mix shift towards flat panel products which carry higher gross margins  as well as lower costs of quality for our x ray tube products 
our success in our x ray products business depends upon our ability to anticipate changes in our markets  the direction of technological innovation and the demands of our customers 
in addition  changes in access to diagnostic radiology or the reimbursement rates associated with diagnostic radiology as a result of the affordable health care for america act and similar state proposals will likely affect demand for our products in our x ray products business 
other 
the other category is comprised of i sip  which designs  manufactures  sells and services linatron x ray accelerators  imaging processing software and image detection products including intellx tm for security and inspection  ii our vpt business  which designs  develops  manufactures  sells and services products and systems for delivering proton therapy treatments  and iii the operations of the gtc  our scientific research facility 
net orders in the other category increased million in fiscal year from fiscal year reflecting both the million order for the scripps proton therapy center project from cptc in fiscal year and the cancellation of the million skandion kliniken order in fiscal year the increase in net orders in the other category in fiscal year over fiscal year was also attributable to an increase in net orders in sip 
revenues in the other category increased in fiscal year over fiscal year because of the increase in vpt revenues from the scripps proton therapy center project  partially offset by a decrease in sip revenues 
see net orders and other revenues for further discussion of the order and revenues related to the scripps proton therapy center project 
this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as the information contained under item a  risk factors 
we discuss our results of operations below 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our accounting policies  estimates and assumptions and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
in addition to the accounting policies that are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we consider the critical accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by accounting estimates include revenue recognition  share based compensation expense  valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of warranty obligations  assessment of environmental remediation liabilities  valuation of defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans  valuation of derivative instruments and taxes on earnings 
such accounting policies require us to use judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions regarding matters that are inherently uncertain  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
for a discussion of how these estimates and other factors may affect our business  see item a  risk factors 
revenue recognition we frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as hardware  software and services 
judgments as to the allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement  and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with gaap 
at the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal year  we elected to early adopt the amended software revenue guidance and amended multiple deliverable revenue arrangement guidance on a prospective basis as of the beginning of fiscal year and have applied the amended guidance for revenue arrangements originating or materially modified after october  under the amended guidance  the allocation of consideration in a multiple element arrangement is affected by the determination of whether any software deliverables that function together with other hardware components to deliver the hardware products essential functionality is considered as non software products for purpose of revenue recognition 
the allocation of consideration to each non software deliverable is based on the assumptions we use to establish its selling price  which are based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of selling price  if it exists  otherwise  third party evidence of selling price  if it exists  and if not on estimated selling prices 
in addition  the allocation of consideration to each software deliverable in a multiple element arrangement is affected by our judgment as to whether vsoe of its fair value exists in these arrangements 
under the prior authoritative guidance  the allocation of consideration to each deliverable in a multiple deliverable arrangement is affected by our judgment as to whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value existed for hardware deliverables and vsoe of the fair value existed for software deliverables in these arrangements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the amounts allocated to each element could affect the timing and amount of revenue recognition 
revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance and the readiness of customers facilities 
if shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner  our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations 
in addition  revenues related to certain highly customized image detection systems  proton therapy systems and proton therapy system commissioning contracts are recognized in accordance with contract accounting 
for contracts in which we can estimate contract costs with reasonable dependability  we 
table of contents recognize contract revenues under the percentage of completion method 
revenues recognized under the percentage of completion method are based on contract costs incurred to date compared with total estimated contract costs 
changes in estimates of total contract revenue  total contract cost or the extent of progress towards completion are recognized in the period in which the changes in estimates are identified 
estimated losses on contracts are recognized in the period in which the loss is identified 
in circumstances in which the final outcome of a contract cannot be precisely estimated but a loss on the contract is not expected  the company recognizes revenues under the percentage of completion method based on a zero profit margin until more precise estimates can be made 
if and when the company can make more precise estimates  revenues and costs of sales are adjusted in the same period 
because the percentage of completion method involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues  costs and profits and in assigning the dollar amounts to relevant accounting periods  and because the estimates must be periodically reviewed and appropriately adjusted  if our estimates prove to be inaccurate or circumstances change over time  we may be forced to adjust revenues or even record a contract loss in later periods 
if a loss is expected on a contract under the percentage of completion method  the estimated loss would be charged to cost of sales in the period the loss is identified 
share based compensation expense we value our stock options granted and the option component of the shares of vms common stock purchased under the employee stock purchase plan using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by vms s stock price  as well as the input of other subjective assumptions  including the expected term of stock awards and the expected price volatility of vms stock over the expected term of the awards 
the expected term is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and post vesting cancellations of stock options by our employees 
we determined the expected term of stock options based on the demographic grouping of employees and retirement eligibility 
we used a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  in deriving the expected volatility assumption 
blended volatility represents the weighted average of implied volatility and historical volatility 
implied volatility is derived based on traded options on vms common stock 
implied volatility is weighted in the calculation of blended volatility based on the ratio of the term of the exchange traded options to the expected terms of the employee stock options 
historical volatility represents the remainder of the weighting 
our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options on vms common stock is reflective of market conditions and is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
in determining the extent of use of implied volatility  we considered i the volume of market activity of traded options  ii the ability to reasonably match the input variables of traded options to those of stock options granted by us  including the date of grant  iii the similarity of the exercise prices  and iv the length of term of traded options 
after considering the above factors  we determined that we could not rely exclusively on implied volatility based on the fact that the term of vms exchange traded options is less than one year and that it is different from the expected terms of the stock options we grant 
therefore  we believe a combination of the historical volatility over the expected terms of the stock options we grant and the implied volatility of exchange traded options best reflects the expected volatility of vms common stock 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of no dividend payouts 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers prior to authorizing shipment for all major sale transactions 
except for government tenders  group purchases and orders with letters of credit in oncology systems  sip and vpt  and orders in our x ray products business  our payment terms usually require payment of a small portion of the total amount due when the customer signs the purchase order  a significant amount upon transfer of risk of loss to the customer and the remaining amount upon completion of the installation 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts 
if our evaluation of our customers financial conditions does not reflect our future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions may be needed and our operating results could be negatively affected 
inventories our inventories include high technology parts and components that are highly specialized in nature and that are subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
we have programs to minimize the required inventories on hand and we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and on order and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand and production 
actual demand may differ from our estimates  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory  which would have an impact on our operating results 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the majority of businesses that we have acquired have not had significant identified tangible assets and  as a result  we have typically allocated a significant portion of the purchase price to intangible assets and goodwill 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of these acquired intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to these intangibles or to goodwill if indicators of impairment exist 
the allocation of the purchase price from business acquisitions to goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant impact on our future operating results 
in addition  the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired businesses to goodwill and intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for those cash flows 
should conditions differ from management s estimates at the time of the acquisition  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results 
in accordance with accounting standard codification asc  we evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually or whenever an event occurs or circumstances changes that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit against its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting units 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit is in excess of its fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  if any  consists of a comparison of fair value to carrying value  with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recorded as an impairment loss 
based on the most recent annual goodwill impairment testing that we performed in fiscal year for each of our four reporting units with goodwill oncology systems  x ray products  sip and vpt  the fair value of each such reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value 
we will continue to make 
table of contents assessments of impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise 
warranty obligations we warrant most of our products for a specific period of time  usually twelve months  against material defects 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenues when the related revenues are recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale of the total costs that we will incur to repair or replace product parts that fail while still under warranty 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs 
for new products  estimates will include historical experience of similar products  as well as reasonable allowance for start up expenses 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update the historical warranty cost trends  if required 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty costs in the future  it would have a negative effect on our operating results 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world 
those laws regulate multiple aspects of our operations  including the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous substances 
they impose costs on our operations and in connection with past operations 
in connection with past operations  we record environmental remediation liabilities when we conclude that environmental assessments or remediation efforts are probable and we believe we can reasonably estimate the costs of those efforts 
our accrued environmental costs represent our best estimate of the total costs of assessments and remediation and the time period over which we expect to incur those costs 
we review these accrued balances quarterly 
were we required to increase or decrease the accrued environmental costs in the future  it would adversely or favorably impact our operating results 
defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans we sponsor five defined benefit pension plans in germany  japan  switzerland and the united kingdom covering employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements in these countries 
in july  we made changes to the defined benefit pension plan in the united kingdom by terminating the accrual of additional benefits for existing participants and suspending the enrollment of new participants 
although we do not have any defined benefit pension plans in the united states  we sponsor a post retirement benefit plan that provides healthcare benefits to certain eligible retirees 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expenses and liabilities related to those plans for which the benefits are actuarially determined  such as our defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases and rate of healthcare cost increases  all of which we determine within certain guidelines 
in addition  we also use assumptions  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the expenses and liabilities 
the actuarial assumptions we use are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience particularly in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant impact on the amount of defined benefit pension and post retirement benefit plan expense we record 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return on those assets 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rates used for defined benefit plans in all countries are based primarily on the yields of a universe of high quality corporate bonds in each applicable country or the spot rate of high quality aa rated corporate bonds  
table of contents with durations corresponding to the expected durations of the benefit obligations 
a change in the discount rate will cause the present value of benefit obligations to change in the opposite direction 
valuation of derivative instruments we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the effects of currency fluctuations on sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies and on assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
these foreign currency forward contracts are derivative instruments and are measured at fair value 
asc establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value see note  fair value of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
the fair value of foreign currency forward contracts are calculated primarily using level inputs  which include currency spot and forward rates  interest rate and credit or non performance risk 
the spot rate for each currency is the same spot rate used for all balance sheet translations at the measurement date and sourced from our major trading banks 
the forward point values for each currency and the london interbank offered rate libor to discount assets and liabilities are interpolated from commonly quoted broker services 
one year credit default swap spreads of the counterparty at the measurement date are used to adjust derivative assets  all of which mature in less than months  for non performance risk 
we are required to adjust derivative liabilities to reflect the potential non performance risk to lenders based on our incremental borrowing rate 
each contract is individually adjusted using the counterparty for net asset or our discount rate for net liability 
the use of level inputs in determining fair values requires certain management judgment and subjectivity 
changes to these level inputs could have a material impact to the valuation of our derivative instruments  as well as on our result of operations 
taxes on earnings we are subject to taxes on earnings in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
as a global taxpayer  significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for taxes on earnings 
the provisions in asc related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes contain a two step approach to recognizing  derecognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining whether the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that  based on the technical merits  the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
recognition  derecognition and measurement are based on management s best judgment given the facts  circumstances and information available at the end of the accounting period 
a tax benefit should be recognized in the first period in which it meets the more likely than not recognition threshold  and conversely  a tax benefit previously recognized should be derecognized in the first period in which new information results in a change in judgment in which the position fails to meet the recognition threshold 
a benefit not previously recognized would be recognized when the tax position is effectively settled through examination  negotiation or litigation with tax authorities  or when the statute of limitations for the relevant taxing authority to examine and challenge the position has expired 
our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for taxes on earnings 
generally  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in the applicable tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax assets 
should we conclude it is more likely than not that we will be unable to recover our net deferred tax assets in these tax jurisdictions  we would increase our valuation allowance and our tax provision would increase in the period in which we make such a determination 

table of contents our foreign earnings are generally taxed at rates lower than us rates 
our effective tax rate is impacted by existing tax laws in both the united states and in the respective countries in which our foreign subsidiaries do business 
in addition  a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our foreign countries  or a change in the mix of foreign countries among particular tax jurisdictions  could increase our effective tax rate 
also  our current effective tax rate does not assume us taxes on certain undistributed profits of certain foreign subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or us federal and state taxes should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the united states

in fiscal year  oncology systems  x ray products and vpt contributed to the growth in product revenues over fiscal year  partially offset by a decline in sip product revenues 
in fiscal year 
table of contents the increase in product revenues over fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in product revenues from x ray products  which was mostly offset by the decreases in product revenues from oncology systems and sip 
product revenues grew faster from fiscal year to fiscal year as compared to fiscal year to fiscal year  primarily because oncology systems product revenues showed growth in fiscal year over fiscal year and because vpt began to recognize revenues for the scripps proton therapy center project 
service contract and other revenues increased in fiscal year over fiscal year due to an increase in oncology systems service contract revenues and  to a lesser extent  an increase in sip service contract and other revenues  partially offset by a decline in vpt service contract revenues 
oncology systems service contracts revenues were the primary contributor to the growth in service contracts and other revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year  although  to a lesser extent  vpt and sip also contributed to the increase in service contracts and other revenues 
service contracts and other revenues grew slower in fiscal year over compared to fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to the slower growth in oncology systems service contract revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year the increase in north american revenues in fiscal year from fiscal year was due to increases in revenues in oncology systems  x ray products  and the vpt and sip businesses 
north american revenues decreased in fiscal year over fiscal year as the decline in north american revenues from oncology systems and sip more than offset the increase in x ray products north american revenues 
international revenues increased in fiscal year over fiscal year due to increases in international revenues in oncology systems and x ray products  although these were partially offset by declines in international revenues in sip and vpt 
all international regions contributed to the growth in international revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year overall  the us dollar was weaker against foreign currencies in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  which favorably affected our international revenues when measured in us dollars

oncology systems product revenues increased in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to increases in revenues from sales of our linear accelerators and  to a lesser extent  from sales of our software products 
oncology systems product revenues decreased in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily as a result of decreased revenues from sales of our linear accelerators  partially offset by increased revenues from sales of our brachytherapy products 
the increases in service contract revenues  in fiscal year over fiscal year and in fiscal year over fiscal year  were primarily driven by increased customer adoption of service contracts as our products become more sophisticated and by increased number of customers as the installed base of our products continues to grow 
since service contract revenues grew faster than product revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year and from fiscal year to fiscal year  service contract revenues also increased as a percentage of total oncology systems revenues in each fiscal year

north american oncology systems product revenues decreased in fiscal year over fiscal year due to decreased sales in most product lines  although the decrease was partially offset by increased service contract revenues 
varying cycles of higher and lower revenues between the international and north american regions is a historical pattern reflecting regional influences such the effects of government economic stimulus programs  the effects of the recession and slow economic recovery  the effects of the european sovereign debt crisis  uncertainty created by healthcare reform and reductions in medicare reimbursement rates for radiotherapy and radiosurgery in the united states  and different technology adoption cycles that are consistent with the net order patterns discussed more fully under net orders

the increase in x ray products north american revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year was due to increased revenues from sales of our flat panel products  partially offset by a decline in revenues from sales of our x ray tube products 
the fluctuation of the us dollar against foreign currencies did not have a material impact on x ray products international revenue growth because sales transactions in the x ray products business are primarily denominated in us dollars 

table of contents other revenues revenues by sales classification fiscal years dollars in millions change change product service contracts and other total other other revenues as a percentage of total revenues revenues in the other category  which is comprised of sip  vpt and gtc  increased in fiscal year over fiscal year because of an increase in vpt revenues primarily associated with product revenues recognized for the proton therapy system for the scripps proton therapy center project  partially offset by a decrease in product revenues in our sip business as a result of slower deployment of products for security and inspection systems 
in fiscal year  we recognized revenue of million for the scripps proton therapy center project 
we signed the equipment purchase agreement with cptc for this project in april and we did not book this order until september when the financing was completed 
the million revenue we recognized represented progress made on this project since the equipment purchase agreement was signed 
revenues in our other category increased in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to an increase in vpt service revenues related to the commissioning of a proton therapy system  partially offset by a decrease in sip revenues from decreased sales of our linatron products 
gross margin fiscal years dollars in millions change change dollar by segment oncology systems x ray products other gross margin percentage by segment oncology systems x ray products total company in fiscal year  the increase in total company gross margin percentage over fiscal year was primarily due to increases in gross margins in oncology systems  x ray products and sip 
the improvement in sip gross margin was primarily due to a mix shift toward higher margin products 
however  total company gross margin percentage in fiscal year was negatively impacted by vpt  which began to recognize revenues with a zero profit margin for the scripps proton therapy center project 
in fiscal year  total company gross margin percentage increased slightly over fiscal year primarily due to the improvement in x ray products and oncology systems gross margins  while the gross margin percentage for the other category remained relatively flat 
total product gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year total service contracts and other gross margin was in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year and in fiscal year oncology systems gross margin in fiscal year increased percentage point over fiscal year primarily due to increases in both service and product gross margins

x ray products gross margin increased percentage point in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to product mix shift toward higher margin products and higher sales volume 
for the scripps proton therapy center project  we recognized revenues under the percentage of completion method as we can provide a reasonably dependable cost estimate for this project 
although we cannot precisely estimate the project s final outcome due to certain uncertainties and contingencies  we do not expect a loss on this project 
accordingly  we began to recognize revenues for this project initially under the zero profit margin approach until these uncertainties and contingencies are resolved

taxes on earnings fiscal years change change effective tax rate 
table of contents the slight decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in the benefit from discrete items in fiscal year  including a greater release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions  partially offset by a decrease in the benefit from the foreign rate differential in fiscal year the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in the benefit from discrete items in fiscal year  including a smaller release of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as a result of settlements with taxing authorities and the expiration of the statutes of limitation in various jurisdictions  partially offset by an increase in the benefit from the foreign rate differential in fiscal year in general  our effective income tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate primarily because our foreign earnings are taxed at rates that are  on average  lower than the us federal rate  and our domestic earnings are subject to state income taxes 
our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by having lower earnings than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher earnings than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  and by changes in tax laws or interpretations of those laws 
for example  recent proposals would make significant changes us taxation of us based multinational corporations 
although we cannot predict whether or in what form congress would enact any such proposals  legislation of this type could have an adverse impact on our effective tax rate 
we also expect that our effective tax rate may experience increased fluctuation from period to period under the provisions in asc related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes

oncology systems north american net orders increased in fiscal year over fiscal year  with growth in net orders in the second half of the fiscal year more than offsetting the net order decline in the first half of the fiscal year 
increased demand for our linear accelerators  driven by the truebeam system  as well as increased demand for our service contracts  including software service agreements  were the primarily contributors to the oncology systems north american net order increase in fiscal year over fiscal year oncology systems international net orders increased  or on a constant currency basis  in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily due to increased demand for our linear accelerators including the truebeam system and unique and our software products  in europe and asia  as well as growth in demand for our service contracts in all international regions 
the overall weaker us dollar against foreign currencies in fiscal year compared to fiscal year favorably impacted oncology systems international net orders when measured in us dollars

table of contents experience regional fluctuations 
in addition  the availability of government programs that stimulate the purchase of healthcare products  such as the one in place in in japan  could affect the demand for our products from period to period  and could therefore make it difficult to compare our financial results 
x ray products net orders grew in fiscal year over fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year over fiscal year in fiscal year  the increase in x ray products net orders over fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in both north american and international net orders 
increased demand for both the x ray tube products and the flat panel products contributed the fiscal year increase in north american x ray products net orders 
the fiscal year increase in international x ray products net orders was primarily due to increased demand for x ray tube products in asia and europe and increased demand for flat panel products in europe  partially offset by a decline in net orders for flat panel products in asia 
the growth in x ray products net orders in fiscal year was primarily due to increased demand for flat panel products  especially our radiographic flat panels  in north america  europe and asia  as well as increased demand for our x ray tubes products in asia 
net orders in the other category increased million in fiscal year from fiscal year with vpt recording the million order from cptc for the scripps proton therapy center project in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and cancelling the million proton therapy system order from skandion kliniken in fiscal year the increase in net orders in the other category in fiscal year over fiscal year was also attributable to a million increase in net orders in sip primarily due to i increased demand for linatron x ray accelerators for cargo screening and border protection and ii a million order from us customs and border protection for five of our intellx cargo screening systems 
net orders in the other category declined million in fiscal year over fiscal year primarily because vpt booked the million skandion kliniken order in fiscal year and then cancelled in fiscal year without booking any further orders 
sip also experienced a decrease in net orders in fiscal year compared to fiscal year as this business was negatively impacted by bid award challenges among competitors for a large government project in north america 
orders in any period may not be directly correlated to the level of revenues in any particular future quarter or period since the timing of revenue recognition will vary significantly based on the delivery requirements of individual orders  acceptance schedules and the readiness of individual customer sites for installation of our products 
moreover  certain types of orders  such as orders for software or newly introduced products in our oncology systems segment  typically take more time from order to completion of installation and acceptance than hardware or older products 
discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we approved a plan to sell research instruments to focus the business that we acquired from accel exclusively on the development of our vpt business

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  acquire businesses  repurchase vms stock  and fund continuing operations 
our sources of cash have included operations  borrowings  stock option exercises and employee stock purchases although no purchases under our employee stock purchase plan were made during fiscal year and interest income 
our cash usage is actively managed on a daily basis to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs 
because research instruments cash flows were not material for any period presented  we have not segregated them from continuing operations on our consolidated statements of cash flows and the discussion herein 
cash and cash equivalents the following table summarizes our cash and cash equivalents in millions september  october  increase cash and cash equivalents our cash and cash equivalents increased million from million at october  to million at september  the increase in cash and cash equivalents in fiscal year was due primarily to million of cash generated from operating activities  million of cash from net borrowings under our credit facilities  million of cash provided by stock option exercises and million of cash provided by the excess tax benefits from share based compensation 
these increases were partially offset by aggregate payments of million in connection with three accelerated share repurchase agreements and for shares repurchased in the open market  million of capital expenditures  million used for loans to cptc for financing the construction and startup operations of the scripps proton therapy center  million for an investment in a minority equity interest in augmenix plus an exclusive option to purchase the remaining equity interest  million used to satisfy employee tax withholding requirements for employees who tendered vms stock upon vesting of restricted common stock and restricted stock units  million used for the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of a supplier of devices for delivery of brachytherapy treatments and million used for the repayment of bank borrowings 
in addition  foreign currency exchange rate changes in fiscal year increased cash and cash equivalents by million 
at september   we had approximately million or  of total cash and cash equivalents in the united states 
approximately million  or  of total cash and cash equivalents was held abroad and could be subject to additional taxation if it were repatriated to the united states 
as of september   most of our cash and cash equivalents that were held abroad were in us dollars and were primarily held as bank deposits 
because our cash levels in the united states are relatively low

the million increase in net cash from operating activities during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was driven primarily by an increase of million in net earnings and an increase in non cash items of million  partially offset by a net change of million in operating assets and liabilities working capital items 
the major contributors to the net change in working capital items in fiscal year were accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable and advance payments from customers as follows accounts receivable increased million due to higher revenues and timing of collections 
inventories increased by million due to anticipated customer demands for products in fiscal year mainly in oncology systems and x ray products 
accounts payable increased by million due to timing of vendor payments  increased purchases due to the overall growth of our operations and payment due for settlement of a contract 
advance payments from customers increased by million due to increased orders 
the million increase in net cash from operating activities during fiscal year compared to fiscal year was driven primarily by a net change of million in operating assets and liabilities working capital items  an increase in non cash items of million and an increase of million in net earnings 
the major contributors to the net change in working capital items in fiscal year were inventories and advance payments from customers as follows inventories increased by million due to anticipated customer demands for products in fiscal year in oncology systems  x ray products and vpt 
advance payments from customers increased by million due to increased orders  as well as receipt of a down payment for a proton therapy system not yet recognized in net orders as of the end of the third quarter

in the first quarter of fiscal year  we entered into a new contract the new contract to perform certain services for a fixed price 
the balance of the loss accrual related to this contingency the new contract was million as of september  if the actual costs related to the contingency exceed the estimated amount or if the estimated loss increases  the variances will be recognized in the consolidated statements of earnings in the periods in which these variances arise 
other matters from time to time  we are a party to or otherwise involved in legal proceedings  claims and government inspections or investigations and other legal matters both in and outside the united states  arising in the ordinary course of our business or otherwise 
such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance 
we accrue amounts  to the extent they can be reasonably estimated  that we believe are adequate to address any liabilities related to legal proceedings and other loss contingencies that we believe will result in a probable loss 
while the outcome of these matters is currently not determinable  we do not expect that the ultimate costs to resolve these matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  it is possible that a legal or other proceeding brought against us could have an impact of this nature 
off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business  we provide standard indemnification of business partners and customers for losses suffered or incurred for property damages  death and injury and for patent  copyright or any other intellectual property infringement claims by any third parties with respect to our products 
the terms of these indemnification arrangements are generally perpetual 
except for losses related to property damages  the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these arrangements is unlimited 
as of september   we have not incurred any significant costs since the spin offs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements 
as a result  we believe the estimated fair value of these arrangements is minimal 
we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers and certain of our employees that serve as officers or directors of our foreign subsidiaries that may require us to indemnify our directors and officers and those certain employees against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers  and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any legal proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to three primary types of market risks credit risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
credit risk we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the foreign currency forward contracts used in hedging activities 
these counterparties are large international and regional financial institutions and to date  no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligation to us under such contracts 
in addition  cash and cash equivalents held with financial institutions may exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits or similar limits in foreign jurisdictions 
we also may need to rely on the credit facility described below under interest rate risk 
our access to our cash and cash equivalents or ability to borrow could be reduced if one or more financial institutions with which we have deposits or from which we borrow should fail or otherwise be adversely impacted by conditions in the financial or credit markets 
conditions such as those we experienced as a result of the economic downturn of and and accompanying contraction in the credit markets heighten these risks 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as a global entity  we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
adverse foreign currency rate movements could have a material negative impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures related to foreign currency denominated sales and purchases are in europe  asia  australia and canada 
we have many transactions denominated in foreign currencies and address certain of those financial exposures through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we sell products throughout the world  often in the currency of the customer s country  and may hedge certain of these larger foreign currency transactions when they are not transacted in the subsidiaries functional currency or in us dollars 
the foreign currency sales transactions that fit our risk management policy criteria are hedged with forward contracts 
we may use other derivative instruments 
table of contents in the future 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts primarily to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the forward contracts range from one to twelve months in maturity 
we also hedge the balance sheet exposures from our various foreign subsidiaries and business units 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar functional currency 
the notional amounts of forward contracts are not a measure of our exposure 
the fair value of forward contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account and approximating the current unrealized and realized gains or losses of the open contracts 
a move in foreign currency exchange rates would change the fair value of the contracts  and the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would change in a similar offsetting manner 
the notional values and the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates of our sold and purchased forward exchange contracts outstanding at september  were as follows in millions notional value sold notional value purchased weighted average contract rate foreign currency units per usd australian dollar british pound danish krone euro japanese yen new zealand dollar norwegian krone swedish krona swiss franc totals interest rate risk our market risk exposure to changes in interest rates depends primarily on our investment portfolio and short term borrowings 
our investment portfolio consisted of cash and cash equivalents and a short term investment as of september  the principal amount of cash and cash equivalents at september  totaled million with a weighted average interest rate of 
at september   our short term investment represented a loan of million to cptc  which bears interest at libor plus per annum with a minimum interest rate of per annum 
the amended bofa credit facility including the japanese line of credit allows us to borrow up to a maximum amount of million 
we collateralized a portion of the amended bofa credit facility with a pledge of of the voting shares that we hold in varian medical systems nederland bv  a wholly owned subsidiary 
borrowings under the amended bofa credit facility outside of the japanese line of credit accrue interest based on the libor  the federal funds rate  or the bofa s prime rate plus a margin 
borrowings under the japanese line of credit accrue interest at the basic loan rate announced by the bank of japan plus a margin 
we are affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable under the amended bofa credit facility including the japanese line of credit 
as of september   the amount outstanding under the amended bofa credit facility was million  none of which was outstanding under the japanese line of credit  with interest being accrued on libor or bofa s prime rate plus a margin 
if the amount outstanding under the amended bofa credit 
table of contents facility remained at this level for an entire year and the libor and bofa s prime rate increased or decreased  respectively  by  our annual interest expense would increase or decrease  respectively  by an additional million 
see a detailed discussion of the amended bofa credit facility in item  md a liquidity and capital resources 
in addition  we had million of long term debt including the current maturities of long term debt outstanding at september  that carried a weighted average fixed interest rate of with principal payments due in various installments over a three year period 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate of our investment portfolio  short term borrowings or long term debt  but may consider the use of derivative instruments in the future 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year for our cash and cash equivalents  short term borrowings and long term debt 
fiscal years dollars in millions thereafter total assets cash and cash equivalents average interest rate short term investment average interest rate liabilities long term debt average interest rate short term borrowings under credit facility average interest rate represents interest rates effective as of september  represents amount loaned to cptc under a loan facility 
see note  variable interest entity of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion 
the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents and the estimated fair value of our short term borrowings under the credit facility approximated the principal amounts reflected above based on the maturities of these financial instruments 
the estimated fair value of our short term investment also approximated the principal amount as this investment was made at the end of fiscal year the fair value of our long term debt was estimated based on the current rates available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities 
under this method  the fair value of our debt was estimated to be million at september  we determined the estimated fair value amount by using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
however  considerable judgment is required in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the fair value estimate presented herein is not necessarily indicative of the amount that we or holders of the instruments could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value 
although payments under certain of our operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  these operating leases do not expose us to material interest rate risk
