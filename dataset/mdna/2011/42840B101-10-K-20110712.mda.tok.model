strong unit sales at higher average prices helped increase sales of fluticasone propionate nasal spray to  for the year versus  in the previous year 
sales of dorzolamide with timolol ophthalmic solution and dorzolamide ophthalmic solution dropped to approximately  from approximately  in the previous year due to significantly lower pricing for the products 
sales of cold and flu items declined during the year  compared to a period of unusually strong demand during summer lower pricing and unit volumes of acetic acid with hydrocortisone also contributed to the decline in sales of other generic products 
the company temporarily halted sales of several unapproved products in late june  which resulted in lower sales of these products 
as of today  the company has not resumed shipments of these products 
sales of these products totaled approximately  in the health care products division  which markets the company s branded otc products  experienced higher sales due to the company s acquisition of the magox line of magnesium supplements from blaine pharmaceuticals in march ecr pharmaceuticals  which sells branded prescription products  saw increased sales of the lodrane line of antihistamines  which were partially offset by lower sales of the dexpak line of corticosteroids due to competition 

table of contents on march   the us food and drug administration fda indicated in its medwatch publication that the agency removed approximately currently marketed cough cold and allergy related products including lodrane products

pricing decreases and unit sales declines of the higher margin acetic acid with hydrocortisone also contributed to this trend 
increased sales of fluticasone propionate nasal spray at higher average prices partially offset this effect as did increased sales of the magox line of magnesium supplements and lodrane  which sell at margins above the company s average 
the company experienced an increase in prices on certain raw materials and components which increased cost of sales for certain generic products 
included in cost of sales is a reserve of  for potential obsolescence of lodrane and zolpimist inventory for the ecr subsidiary 
expense items change change selling  general and administrative expense research and product development costs royalty income contract research income interest expense interest income and other provision for income tax expense the decline in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to absence of the royalty payment on profits of dorzolamide with timolol ophthalmic solution which was  in the prior period 
the company bought out its partner on the product in january for  and no longer incurs this expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the ecr pharmaceuticals subsidiary rose as the sales force increased

recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued accounting standard update asu no 
 other expenses topic fees paid to the federal government by pharmaceutical manufacturers 
this asu provides guidance on how pharmaceutical manufacturers should recognize and classify in their income statements fees mandated by the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca and the health care and education reconciliation act  both enacted in march  referred to as the acts 
the acts impose an annual fee on the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry for each calendar year beginning on or after january  an entity s portion of the annual fee is payable no later than september of the applicable calendar year and is not tax deductible 
a portion of the annual fee will be allocated to individual entities on the basis of the amount of their brand prescription drug sales including authorized generic product sales for the preceding year as a percentage of the industry s brand prescription drug sales including authorized generic product sales for the same period 
an entity s portion of the annual fee becomes payable to the us treasury once a pharmaceutical manufacturing entity has a gross receipt from branded prescription drug sales to any specified government program or in accordance with coverage under any government program for each calendar year beginning on or after january  the amendments in this asu specify that the liability for the fee should be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale with a corresponding deferred cost that is amortized to expense using a straight line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee over the calendar year that it is payable 
the annual fee is classified as an operating expense in the income statement 
the amendments in this asu were effective for calendar years beginning after december   when the fee initially became effective 
the annual impact of this fee on us will be highly variable depending on the volume of our sales of authorized generics and brand products 
there was no material impact of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements of the company at april  the fasb has issued asu  business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the amendments in this asu affect any public entity as defined by topic  business combinations  that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
the amendments in this asu specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  in december  the fasb updated the accounting guidance relating to the annual goodwill impairment test 
the updated guidance requires companies to perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  when it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit is zero or negative 
in considering whether it is more likely than not that goodwill impairment exists  an entity shall evaluate whether there are adverse qualitative factors 
the updated guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents in june  the fasb updated the disclosure requirements for comprehensive income 
the updated guidance requires companies to disclose the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the updated guidance does not affect how earnings per share is calculated or presented 
the updated guidance is effective for the company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year the company is currently evaluating the impact of adoption of this accounting guidance on its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses for the reporting period covered thereby 
as a result  these estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
we base our estimates and judgments on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information that we obtain from our customers and outside sources  and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments which impact our reported operating results and the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include but are not limited to the percentage of new products which may have chargebacks and the percentage of items which will be subject to price decreases 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note a to our financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable  adjustments for returns and price adjustments  allowance for doubtful accounts and carrying value of inventory represent significant estimates made by management 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenue is recognized for product sales upon shipment and when risk is passed to the customer and when estimates of discounts  rebates  promotional adjustments  price adjustments  returns  chargebacks  and other potential adjustments are reasonably determinable  collection is reasonably assured and the company has no further performance obligations 
these estimates are presented in the financial statements as reductions to net revenues and accounts receivable 
estimated sales returns  allowances and discounts are provided for in determining net sales 
contract research income is recognized as work is completed and billable costs are incurred 
in certain cases  contract research income is based on attainment of designated milestones 
adjustments for returns and price adjustments our product revenues are typically subject to agreements with customers allowing chargebacks  rebates  rights of return  pricing adjustments and other allowances 
based on our agreements and contracts with our customers  we calculate adjustments for these items when we recognize revenue and we book the adjustments against accounts receivable and revenue 
chargebacks  primarily from wholesalers  are the most significant of these items 
chargebacks result from arrangements we have with end users establishing prices for products for which the end user independently selects a wholesaler from which to purchase 
a chargeback represents the difference between our invoice price to the wholesaler  which is typically stated at wholesale acquisition cost  and the end customer s contract price  which is lower 
we credit the wholesaler for purchases by end customers at the lower price 
therefore  we record these chargebacks at the time we recognize revenue in connection with our sales to wholesalers 
the reserve for chargebacks is computed in the following manner 
the company obtains wholesaler inventory data for the wholesalers which represent approximately of our chargeback activity 
this inventory is multiplied by the historical percentage of units that are charged back and by the price adjustment per unit to arrive at the chargeback accrual 
this calculation is performed by product by customer 
the calculated amount of chargebacks could be affected by other factors such as a change in retail customer mix a change in negotiated terms with retailers product sales mix at the wholesaler retail inventory levels changes in wholesale acquisition cost wac the company continually monitors the chargeback activity and adjusts the provisions for chargebacks when we believe that the actual chargebacks will differ from our original provisions 

table of contents consistent with industry practice  the company maintains a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period 
the company s estimate for returns is based upon its historical experience with actual returns 
while such experience has allowed for reasonable estimation in the past  history may not always be an accurate indicator of future returns 
the company continually monitors its estimates for returns and makes adjustments when it believes that actual product returns may differ from the established accruals 
included in the adjustment for sales allowances and returns is a reserve for credits taken by our customers for rebates  return authorizations and other discounts 
sales discounts are granted for prompt payment 
the reserve for sales discounts is based on invoices outstanding and assumes that of available discounts will be taken 
price adjustments  including shelf stock adjustments  are credits issued from time to time to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products which our customer has remaining in its inventory at the time of the price reduction 
decreases in our selling prices are discretionary decisions made by us to reflect market conditions 
amounts recorded for estimated price adjustments are based upon specified terms with direct customers  estimated launch dates of competing products  estimated declines in market price and inventory held by the customer 
the company analyzes this on a case by case basis and makes adjustments to reserves as necessary 
the company adequately reserves for chargebacks  discounts  allowances and returns in the period in which the sales takes place 
no material amounts included in the provision for chargebacks and the provision for sales discounts recorded in the current period relate to sales made in the prior periods 
the provision for sales allowances and returns includes reserves for items sold in the current and prior periods 
the company has substantially and consistently used the same estimating methods 
we have refined the methods as new data became available 
there have been no material differences between the estimates applied and actual results 
the company determines amounts that are material to the financial statements in consideration of all relevant circumstances including quantitative and qualitative factors 
among the items considered is the impact on individual financial statement classification  operating income and footnote disclosures and the degree of precision that is attainable in estimating judgmental items 
the following table presents the roll forward of each significant estimate  which balances are reflected as deductions from accounts receivable as of april   and and for the years then ended  respectively 
beginning balance may current provision actual credits in current period ending balance april for the year ended april  chargebacks sales discounts sales allowances returns total adjustment for returns price allowances for the year ended april  chargebacks sales discounts sales allowances returns total adjustment for returns price allowances for the year ended april  chargebacks sales discounts sales allowances returns total adjustment for returns price allowances 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we have historically provided credit terms to customers in accordance with what management views as industry norms 
financial terms  for credit approved customers  are generally on either a net or day basis  though most customers are entitled to a prompt payment discount 
management periodically and regularly reviews customer account activity in order to assess the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  considering factors such as economic conditions and each customer s payment history and creditworthiness 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or if they were otherwise unable to make payments in accordance with management s expectations  we would have to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories we state inventories at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined based upon standard costing 
in evaluating the inventory  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  estimated time required to sell existing inventory and expected market conditions  including levels of competition 
we establish reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories based upon our historical experience  product expiration dates and management s assessment of current product demand 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of april  we are not involved in any material unconsolidated transactions
