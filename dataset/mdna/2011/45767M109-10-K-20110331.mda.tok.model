overview innotrac  founded in and headquartered in atlanta  georgia  is a full service fulfillment and logistics provider serving enterprise clients and world class brands 
the company employs sophisticated order processing and warehouse management technology and operates seven fulfillment centers and one call center in seven cities spanning all time zones across the continental united states 
prior to  the company was primarily focused on the telecommunications industry  with over of its revenues being derived through this vertical 
today  the company primarily serves four lines of business  or industry verticals 
this is a result of a significant effort made by the company to diversify both its industry and client base over the past several years 
we classify those industry verticals as i ecommerce direct to consumer  ii direct marketing  iii business to business  and iv telecommunication products and modems 
during all of and most of the united states economy has been in a recession with only the last quarter of showing signs of a general recovery 
adding to the recession in was our loss of two key revenue streams 
one was due to a customer s merger in with a larger company which transitioned some of their services from us to their in house capacity and the second due to the liquidation of one of our major customer s businesses by its parent company 
as a defensive response to this difficult environment in we i consolidated our call centers from two locations to one  and ii shut a facility in romeoville  illinois which was at the end of its lease term 
as an offensive strategy  during and we i renegotiated the terms of specific leases to reduce the space leased and the rate per square foot paid while maintaining the first right to expand into unused space  ii maintained administrative payroll to insure our ability to respond to the economy when it improves  iii invested in a total of five new sales and marketing positions with the expectation of increasing an additional two sales positions in  iv increased development activities with industry leading internet web hosting development companies  and v increased our marketing efforts through targeted business development programs  redesign of our company website and industry trade show attendance 
additionally  as a result of efforts begun in the second half of  we have signed an agreement to form a joint venture which will be called innotrac europe gmbh with an existing fulfillment services company in germany which will give innotrac and our customers wishing to distribute product in europe and the united kingdom access to an established  integrated network of fulfillment centers  call centers  and returns processing centers in those markets 
we believe that expansion of our capabilities through this joint venture will provide innotrac with an access to new clients just entering the united states market and strengthen our relationship with existing clients wanting to expand into europe 
our business has a long selling cycle 
several new customers  which we began discussions with in the spring of  resulted in signed contracts occurring between october of and january of and which should begin to generate revenues between january and july as a result of this selling cycle  we expect to increase our customer base during  but a full year of new revenues from those customers will not be seen until accordingly  we expect to generate a net loss in while delivering positive cash flow from operations 
innotrac has twenty five years of experience as a provider of fulfillment services with installed capacity sufficient to support revenue growth of over thirty percent of our reported service revenues 
with no outstanding debt at december   we have the liquidity to continue to invest in our business development activities to increase our revenues and improve our operating results 
macro economic factors beginning at the end of and throughout most of  the united states economy and equity markets went into a negative cycle 
the downturn in the economy has affected nearly all sectors of the economy and our existing client volumes are just beginning to show signs of consistent slow increase 
we are optimistic that recent months trends of improved volumes will continue 
we have also seen an increase in new business opportunities 
we are continuing to monitor the economic trends and business experience of our customers and closely manage our operating costs which vary with volume 
additionally  we believe our mix of multiple customer industries provides some protection from the impact of the downturn as the economy recovers 
however  as discussed in item a risk factors of this annual report on form k our results can be negatively affected depending on the severity or concentration by industry of a renewed or continuing downturn 
business mix the following table sets forth the percentage of revenues generated by the company s various business lines during and business line vertical ecommerce direct to consumer direct marketing modems telecommunications products bb ecommerce direct to consumer and direct marketing 
the company provides a variety of services for a significant number of ecommerce  retail  and direct marketing clients which include such companies as target 
com  a division of target corporation  ann taylor retail  inc  the north face  microsoft  inc  beachbody  llc and thane international 
our revenues are a result of the number of orders and customer service calls received 
our client contracts generally do not guarantee volumes 
the percentage of our revenues attributable to our ecommerce and retail clients increased during as compared to as a result of their decrease in dollars of revenue sold during from being a lesser decrease than the other two cate gories 
we anticipate that the percentage of our revenues attributable to our ecommerce and direct to consumer clients will increase during as we continue to see growth in our customers from this group of clients to be higher than our other client categories 
telecommunications and modems 
the company has historically been a major provider of fulfillment and customer support services to the telecommunications industry 
the consolidation in that industry over the last several years has resulted in a heavy concentration of volume in a few companies  and accordingly  concentration of the service providers to the telecommunication industry 
we had previously projected that our revenues in this vertical would decline below of our total revenues starting in our actual revenue in this vertical was due to a program which operated for a portion of where we sold land line telephones to consumers 
the program was discontinued in november and as a result we p roject that our revenues from this vertical will be approximately for business to business 
the company provides a variety of services for business to business bb clients including napa and the walt disney company 
the decrease of percentage points of total revenues from in to in resulted from both the loss of one client in this vertical in and a reduction in the outsourced fulfillment needs of another client in this category 
although we continue to provide services to business in this vertical  we expect future revenues in this category to remain a smaller portion of our total business mix 
results of operations the following tables set forth summary operating data  expressed as dollars and a percentage of revenues  for the years ended december  and operating results for any period are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
the financial information provided below has been rounded in order to simplify its presentation 
however  the percentages below are calculated using the detailed information contained in the financial statements and notes thereto 
thousands of dollars year ended december  service revenues freight revenues total revenues cost of service revenues freight expense selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization operating loss income before goodwill impairment goodwill impairment operating loss other expense loss before taxes income tax provision benefit net loss percent of total revenues year ended december  service revenues freight revenues total revenues cost of service revenues freight expense selling  general and administrative goodwill impairment depreciation and amortization operating loss other expense loss before taxes income tax provision benefit net loss service revenues 
the company s service revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million decrease in service revenues is primarily attributable to i a million decrease in revenue from our modem and telecom clients primarily due to the transition of a portion of the at t fulfillment business to at t s in house fulfillment combined with decreased volume from telecom fulfillment due to the industry consolidation previously discussed  ii a million decrease in our ecommerce vertical primarily due to the loss of the smith hawken business and the clients serviced in the romeoville facility offset by a net  increase in volumes from existing clients  iii a million decrease in revenues from our direct marketing vertical due to the loss of a client in the first quarter of and reduced volumes from remaining clients due to the negative economic conditions  offset by the addition of a new client  and iv a million decrease in revenues from our bb clients due to the loss of a client serviced in the romeoville facility and decreased volumes from another client in the bb category 
freight revenues 
the company s freight revenues decreased  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in freight revenues is primarily attributable to a million decrease in bb revenue due to reduced volumes  a  decrease in our ecommerce vertical due to reduced volumes from one of the few ecommerce clients that utilizes company owned freight accounts  a  decrease in revenue from our modem and telecom clients primarily due to the transition of a portion of the at t fulfillment services in house and reduced fulfillment of telecom products  offset by a net million increase in our direct marketing vertical due to the addition of a new client offset by decreased volumes from existing clients 
cost of service revenues 
the company s cost of service revenues  which include labor costs for the fulfillment and call centers  telephone minute fees and packaging material costs  decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  cost of service revenues as a percent of service revenues increased slightly to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million decrease in cost of service revenues was primarily due to the combined effect of a decrease in labor costs related to the decreases in service revenue and operating efficiencies resulting from adjusting labor shifts to correspond with client volumes 
freight expense 
the company s freight expense decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  due to the decrease in corresponding freight revenue for the reasons discussed above

s  g a expenses  which include facility and equipment costs  account services and information technology costs  management salaries and legal and accounting fees  decreased to million or of revenues for the year ended december  compared to million or of revenues for the year ended december  the million decrease in expenses in as compared to was primarily attributable to a i million reduction in facility related expenses which include renegotiated lease costs  facility management and equipment maintenance  ii a  reduction in account management costs made to respond to reductions in revenue discussed above  and iii a  net reduction in other costs due to cost savings efforts offset by increased costs related to sales and marketing and worker s compensation loss reserves 
sg a expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased due to the decision to maintain facility and administrative capacity to support projected future growth in the face of the decreased service revenue described above 
goodwill impairment expense 
during the fourth quarter of  we observed a reduction in unit volumes from our existing clients when comparing the same week periods of to in accordance with asc topic no intangibles goodwill and other  the drop of comparable volume combined with the inability to project when the general economic conditions would improve  resulted in our conclusion to take a non cash million goodwill impairment charge at the end of this charge was equal to of the carrying value of our goodwill 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate for the years ended and was 
at december   a valuation allowance was recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets as losses in recent years created uncertainty about the realization of tax benefits in future years 
the existence of a net operating loss carryforward at december  means that income taxes associated with any potential taxable earnings for the year ended december  will be offset by a corresponding decrease of this valuation allowance  resulting in an expected effective tax rate of for the year ended december  as well 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity 
the company funds its operations and capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations and borrowings under a revolving credit facility with wells fargo  na the credit facility 
the company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately  at december  and million at december  additionally  at both december  and  the company had no borrowings under its credit facility 
during the year ended december   the company generated  in cash flow from operating activities compared to generating million cash from operating activities in the year ended december  the million reduction was primarily the result of a  use of cash due to an increase in accounts receivable for the twelve months ended december  compared to million of cash generated from a reduction in accounts receivable for the twelve months ended december  this million change in cash flow from accounts receivable was the direct result of lower revenue generated in compared to producing a reduction in accounts receivable in while the aging from invoice date of accounts receivable outstanding has remained materially unchanged between the th ree years of through offsetting the million reduced cash flow from the change in accounts receivable was a net  increase in cash flow from all other operating activities 
this net  increase in operating cash flow was primarily the result of i generating a net loss of million in compared to generating a net income before goodwill impairment of million in  ii increases in accounts payable of  in compared to reductions of million in due to lower purchases in to support reduced total revenues  and iii reductions in accrued expenses of  in compared to reductions of  in primarily due to reduced freight and supply vendor payables impacted by reduced total revenues 
additionally  non cash expenses for depreciation  which are included in net income  were million compared to million for the year ended december  and respectively 
during the year ended december   net cash used in investing activities consisted mainly of capital expenditures and decreased to million in from million in capital expenditures in both years were made in various facilities to improve operating efficiency or replace equipment as needed 
during the year ended december   there was  cash used by financing activities due to  of expenses related to the first amendment to the credit facility with wells fargo and  of capital lease payments 
during the year ended december   the net cash used in financing activities was million  of which million was used to repay outstanding advances on the credit facility 
additionally during  the company incurred  of loan commitment fees as a result of the renewal of the credit facility with wells fargo in march the company estimates that its cash and financing needs through will be met by cash flows from operations and availability from its credit facility 
the company generated positive cash flows from operations in and as discussed in the overview paragraph of this item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we anticipate growth in our revenues in however  due to the length of our new business selling cycle  we project a net loss from operations while generating a positive cash flow from operations in prior to the following change in inventory event 
positively effecting cash flow from operations in will be an expected reduction in our inventory levels 
we only purchase inventory for two customers under contrac t terms that provide that the risk of inventory obsolescence remain with our customers 
during  one of our customers for whom we purchased inventory decided to discontinue a specific business program and liquidate the inventory supporting that program 
the inventory buyback requirement is defined as the cost of that inventory  so upon buyback  there will be no resulting revenue recorded in our operating results  consistent with past reporting by the company 
we have been notified that the customer intends to buyback approximately million of inventory before the end of the second quarter of this conversion from inventory to cash will provide liquidity to further support our business development and capital asset expenditures during during the year ended december   the company required advances followed by repayment of those advances from its credit facility with the bank resulting in both december  and december  having no amount outstanding on the credit facility 
we will again require use of the facility for short periods of time throughout  but project to have no net borrowing at the end of the year 
our forecast of an operating loss in  however  required us to enter negotiations with the bank to obtain an amendment of the fixed charge ratio covenant of the credit facility 
we obtained the amendment on march  credit facilities 
as amended by the first and second amendments  the credit facility matures on june  the credit facility had a maximum borrowing limit of million at both december  and the credit facility is used to fund the company s capital expenditures  operational working capital and seasonal working capital needs 
although total advances under the credit facility cannot exceed the maximum borrowing limit of million  the credit facility limits borrowings at any time to a specified percentage of eligible accounts receivable and inventory  which totaled million at december  the terms of the credit facility provide that the amount borrowed and outstanding at any time c ombined with certain reserves for letters of credit outstanding and general reserves be subtracted from the facility limit or the value of the total collateral to arrive at an amount of unused availability to borrow under the line of credit 
the total collateral under the credit facility at december  amounted to million 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at december  and the total value of reserves and letters of credit outstanding at that date totaled million 
as a result  the company had million of borrowing availability under the revolving credit line at december  the company has granted a security interest in all of its assets to the lender as collateral under the credit facility 
the credit facility contains a restrictive fixed charge coverage ratio 
the provisions of the credit facility require that the company maintain a lockbox arrangement with the lender  and allows the lender to declare any outstanding borrowing amounts to be immediately due and payable as a result of noncompliance with any of the covenants 
accordingly  in the event of noncompliance  these amounts could be accelerated 
the company was in compliance with all terms of the credit facility at december  and march  for the year ended december   we incurred interest expense of  on the credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
for the year ended december   we paid interest expense of  on the credit facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
at december   the rate of interest being charged on the credit facility was 
the company also incurred unused revolving credit facility fees of approximately  and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
on march   the company entered into a fourth amended and restated loan and security agreement the credit agreement with wachovia bank  national association which changed its name to wells fargo bank  the bank 
pursuant to the credit agreement  as amended by the first and second amendments  the term of the credit facility has been extended through june  and maintains the banks security interest in all of the company s assets

the company will pay a specified fee on undrawn amounts under the credit facility 
after an event of default  all loans will bear interest at the otherwise applicable rate plus per annum 
the credit agreement contains such financial  affirmative and negative covenants by the company as are usual and customary for financings of this kind which can result in the acceleration of the maturity of amounts borrowed under the credit facility  including  without limitation  a restriction on cash dividends  change in ownership control covenants  a subjective material adverse change covenant and financial covenants 
the credit agreement includes such events of default and  as appropriate  grace periods and representations and warranties as are usual and customary for financings of this kind 
the company paid a customary closing fee upon the closing of the credit agreement and would pay a specified fee upon any early ter mination of the credit facility  which fees are customary for transactions of this type 
on may  and march   respectively  the company entered into the first and second amendments to the credit agreement with the bank 
each amendment was effective immediately upon signing and the company paid a customer closing fee upon signing each amendment 
the main purpose of both amendments was to replace the fixed charge ratio covenant included in the existing terms of the credit agreement with maximum monthly and cumulative loss limits for and the first amendment provided for the following specific changes to the terms of the credit facility a 
in the event the current chief financial officer of the company no longer holds that position  the company is provided with days to fill that position  b

contractual obligations 
the company s primary long term contractual commitments consist of operating leases 
as of december   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
in addition  as of december   the company did not participate in any guarantees of other entities obligations  structured finance arrangements  synthetic leases  repurchase obligations or similar commercial or financing commitments 
the following table sets forth the company s contractual commitments by period 
for additional information  see note to the financial statements in s 
payments due by period total less than year years years after years operating leases capital leases line of credit the provisions of the revolving line of credit agreement require that the company maintain a lockbox arrangement with the lender and allow the lender to declare any outstanding borrowing amounts to be immediately due and payable as a result of noncompliance with any of the covenants 
accordingly  in the event of noncompliance  these amounts could be accelerated 
for additional information  including information regarding the interest related to the revolving line of credit  see note the company is required to provide a variety of services under its contracts with customers 
there currently exists an ongoing discussion with one customer regarding the cost to remediate certain defects in company managed software which our customer believes precipitated under billings by our customer to its customers 
as of december   management has accrued  relating to this matter based on the company s best estimate of the cost of a remediation plan 
however  since the discussions are at a very early stage  and the company is not able to determine the probability of a favorable or unfavorable outcome  actual costs and exposure could differ significantly from these estimates 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and demand the most significant use of subjective estimates and management judgment 
because of the uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
specific risks inherent in our application of these critical policies are described below 
for all of these policies  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
these policies often require difficult judgments on complex matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative guidance 
additional information concerning our accounting policies can be found in note to our financial statements 
the policies that we believe are critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and require complex management judgment are discussed below reserve for uncollectible accounts 
the company makes estimates each reporting period associated with its reserve for uncollectible accounts 
these estimates are based on the aging of the receivables and known specific facts and circumstances 
goodwill and other acquired intangibles 
goodwill represents the cost of an acquired enterprise in excess of the fair market value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the company accounts for its goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with asc topic no 
intangibles goodwill and other  which changed the accounting for goodwill and other indefinite life intangibles from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
under asc topic no 
 goodwill impairment may exist if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
as more fully disclosed in note  our annual review date for goodwill and intangible assets was j anuary st of each year and the january  review coincided with less than expected operating performance in the fourth quarter of following completion of the two step testing process prescribed by asc topic no 
 we determined that the carrying value of innotrac s goodwill as of december  was accordingly  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of million at december   and the company no longer carries a value on its balance sheet for goodwill 
accounting for income taxes 
innotrac utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic no 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets if the company considers it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
innotrac s gross deferred tax asset as of december  is million 
this deferred tax asset was generated primarily by net operating loss carryforwards created in prior years and t he goodwill impairment charge of million recorded in innotrac has a net operating loss carryforward of million at december  that expires between and innotrac s ability to generate taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  collection of existing outstanding accounts receivable  competitive pressures on sales and margins and other factors beyond management s control 
these factors  combined with losses in recent years create uncertainty about the ultimate realization of the gross deferred tax asset in future years 
additionally  due to the long selling cycle for new business  the company expects to generate a taxable loss in therefore  there is an inability to recognize the value of any deferred tax asset resulting from the prior years losses 
therefore  a valuation allowance of approximately million and million has been recorded as of december  and  respectiv ely against net deferred tax assets 
income taxes associated with future earnings may be offset by a reduction in the valuation allowance in that future year 
for the year ended december   the deferred income tax benefit of  was offset by a corresponding increase of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
when and if the company can return to consistent profitability and management determines that it will be able to utilize the deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  the valuation allowance may be reduced or eliminated 
accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standards update  or asu  to topic fair value measurements and disclosures 
this update provided requirements of new disclosures of significant transfers in and out of levels and  and expanded disclosure of activity in level see note of these notes to financial statements 
this update also clarified existing disclosures around the level of disaggregation of each class of assets and liabilities  and about fair value inputs and valuation techniques for level and level this update was effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our financial statement s 
in february  the fasb issued asu to topic subsequent events  to amend certain recognition and disclosure requirements related to subsequent events 
the new guidance clarifies that management must evaluate  as of each reporting period  events or transactions that occur after the balance sheet date through the date that the financial statements are issued 
management must perform its assessment for both interim and annual financial reporting periods 
this update also exempts sec filers from disclosing the date through which subsequent events have been evaluated 
adoption of this update did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management believes the company s exposure to market risks investments  interest rates and foreign currency is immaterial 
innotrac holds no market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
at present  the company does not employ any derivative financial instruments and does not currently plan to employ them in the future 
the company does not transact any sales in foreign currency 
to the extent that the company has borrowings outstanding under its credit facility the company will have market risk relating to the amount of borrowings due to variable interest rates under the credit facility
