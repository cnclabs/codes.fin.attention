should any of the hotels experience a significant decline in operational performance  it may affect the company s ability to make distributions to its shareholders  service debt or meet other financial obligations 
the company measures hotel performance by evaluating financial metrics such as revpar  ffo and ebitda 
the company evaluates the hotels in its portfolio and potential acquisitions using these metrics discussed above to determine each portfolio hotel s contribution or acquisition hotel s potential contribution toward reaching the company s goals of providing income to its shareholders through increases in distributable cash flow and increasing long term total returns to shareholders through appreciation in the value of its common shares 
the company invests in capital improvements throughout the portfolio to continue to increase the competitiveness of its hotels and improve their financial performance

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  the operating partnership  lhl and their subsidiaries in which they have a controlling interest  including joint ventures 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated 
use of estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized the information available including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
for example  included in the consolidated financial statements is an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome as anticipated by management in formulating its estimates inherent in these financial statements might not materialize 
however  application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may determine these estimates differently  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
valuation of deferred tax assets as of december   the company had deferred tax assets of million primarily due to past years federal and state tax net operating losses of lhl 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset related to federal loss carryforwards prior to the expiration of the loss carryforwards and has determined that no valuation allowance is required 
the company analyzes state loss carryforwards on a state by state basis and records a valuation allowance when management deems it more likely than not that future results will not generate

revenue recognition the company recognizes hotel operating revenues on an accrual basis consistent with the hotel operations

golf membership  social membership  health club and executive club annual dues are recognized as earned throughout the membership year 
investment in hotel and development properties upon acquisition  the company allocates the purchase price of asset classes based on the fair value of the acquired real estate  furniture  fixtures and equipment  assumed debt  and intangible assets 
the company s investments in hotel and development properties are carried at cost and hotel properties are depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for buildings  years for building improvements  the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the related tenant lease for tenant improvements  years for land improvements  years for golf course land improvements  years for swimming pool assets and to years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
for investments subject to ground leases  assets are depreciated over the shorter of the useful lives of the assets or the term of the ground lease 
renovations and or replacements that improve or extend the life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
furniture  fixtures and equipment under capital leases are carried at the present value of the minimum lease payments 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives and classification of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation expense to reflect each year with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
should the company change the expected useful life or classification of particular assets  it would result in a change in depreciation expense and annual net income 
the company reviews each hotel for impairment at the end of each reporting period or as events and circumstances dictate throughout the year 
a property is considered impaired when the sum of estimated future undiscounted cash flows over the estimated remaining holding period is less than the carrying amount of a property 
at the end of each reporting period  the company assesses whether any quantitative or qualitative triggering events have occurred in relation to a property 
examples of situations considered to be triggering events include a substantial decline in operating cash flows during the period  including declines related to decreased occupancy  adr or revpar  a current or projected loss from operations  a significant cost accumulation above the original acquisition development estimate  a change in plan to sell the property prior to the end of its useful life or holding period  a significant decrease in market price not in line with general market trends  and any other quantitative or qualitative events deemed significant by our management or our board of trustees 

table of contents if the presence of one or more triggering events as described above is identified at the end of a reporting period or throughout the year with respect to a hotel  the company performs a recoverability test 
in doing so  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the estimated remaining holding period is compared to the carrying amount of the hotel 
if the results of a recoverability analysis indicate that the carrying amount of a hotel exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  impairment is indicated 
upon presentation to  discussion with  and approval from the board of trustees  an impairment charge is recorded equal to the excess of the carrying value of the hotel over the fair value 
when performing a recoverability test or estimating the fair value of a property  the company makes certain assumptions including  but not limited to  consideration of projected operating cash flows considering factors such as booking pace  growth rates  occupancy  room rates  property specific operating costs and future capital expenditures  projected costs and dates of completed construction and grand opening for a development property  the likelihood of completion of construction activity for a development property  projected cash flows from the eventual disposition of the hotel or development property based upon our estimation of a property specific capitalization rate  property specific discount rates  and comparable selling prices 
in accordance with gaap guidance  the company considers a hotel or development property as held for sale when a contract for sale is entered into  a substantial non refundable deposit has been received from the purchaser and sale is expected to occur within one year 
share based compensation from time to time  the company awards nonvested shares under the equity incentive plan plan as compensation to officers  employees and non employee trustees 
the shares vest over three to nine years 
the company recognizes compensation expense for nonvested shares on a straight line basis over the vesting period based upon the fair market value of the shares on the date of issuance  adjusted for forfeitures

historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  most real estate industry investors consider ffo and ebitda to be helpful in evaluating a real estate company s operations 
the white paper on ffo approved by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in april defines ffo as net income or loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of properties and items classified by gaap as extraordinary  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of deferred finance costs and after comparable adjustments for the company s portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities and joint ventures 
the company computes ffo consistent with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
with respect to ffo  the company believes that excluding the effect of extraordinary items  real estate related depreciation and amortization  and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of limited significance in evaluating current 
table of contents performance  can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between reits  even though ffo does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders 
however  ffo may not be helpful when comparing the company to non reits 
with respect to ebitda  the company believes that excluding the effect of non operating expenses and non cash charges  and the portion of these items related to unconsolidated entities  all of which are also based on historical cost accounting and may be of limited significance in evaluating current performance  can help eliminate the accounting effects of depreciation and amortization  and financing decisions and facilitate comparisons of core operating profitability between periods and between reits  even though ebitda also does not represent an amount that accrues directly to common shareholders 
ffo and ebitda do not represent cash generated from operating activities determined by gaap and should not be considered as alternatives to net income  cash flows from operations or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
ffo and ebitda are not measures of the company s liquidity  nor are ffo and ebitda indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
these measurements do not reflect cash expenditures for long term assets and other items that have been and will be incurred 
ffo and ebitda may include funds that may not be available for management s discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures  property acquisitions and other commitments and uncertainties 
to compensate for this  management considers the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or the evaluation of the company s operating performance

additional sources of cash are the company s senior unsecured credit facility  lhl s credit facility  secured financing on one or all of the company s unencumbered properties as of december   the sale of one or more properties  equity issuances available under the shelf registration statement and the issuance of up to million of common shares from time to time under the company s equity distribution agreements  which were fully utilized during january and february lhl is a wholly owned subsidiary of the operating partnership 
payments to the operating partnership are required pursuant to the terms of the lease agreements between lhl and the operating partnership relating to the properties owned by the operating partnership and leased by lhl 
lhl s ability to make rent payments to the operating partnership  and the company s liquidity  including its ability to make distributions to shareholders  are dependent on the lessees ability to generate sufficient cash flow from the operation of the hotels 
in addition  cash flow from hotel operations is subject to all operating risks common to the hotel industry 
these risks include adverse effects of weak national  regional and local economic conditions  tightening credit standards  competition for guests and meetings from other hotels  including competition and pricing pressures from internet wholesalers and distributors  increases in operating costs  including wages  benefits  insurance  property taxes and energy  due to inflation and other factors  which may not be offset in the future by increases in room rates  labor strikes  disruptions or lockouts that may impact operating performance  dependence on demand from business and leisure travelers  which may fluctuate and be seasonal  increases in energy costs  airline fares and other expenses related to travel  which may negatively affect traveling  and terrorism  terrorism alerts and warnings  military actions such as the engagements in iraq and afghanistan  pandemics or other medical events which may cause decreases in business and leisure travel 
these factors could adversely affect the ability of the hotel operators to generate revenues which could adversely affect lhl s ability to make rental payments to the company pursuant to the participating leases and ultimately impact the company s liquidity 
the company s senior unsecured credit facility and lhl s credit facility contain certain financial covenants relating to debt service coverage  interest coverage  fixed charge coverage  net worth and total funded indebtedness and contains financial covenants that  assuming no defaults  allow the company to make shareholder distributions 
there are currently no other contractual or other arrangements limiting payment of distributions by the operating partnership 
failure to comply with our financial covenants contained in our credit facilities and non recourse secured mortgages could result from  among other things  changes in our results of operations  the incurrence of 
table of contents additional debt or changes in general economic conditions 
if we violate the financial covenants contained in either credit facility  we may attempt to negotiate a waiver of the violation or amend the terms of the credit facility with the lenders thereunder  however  we can make no assurance that we would be successful in any such negotiations or that  if successful in obtaining a waiver or amendment  such amendment or waiver would be on terms attractive to us 
if a default under any of the above debt instruments were to occur  we would possibly have to refinance the debt through additional debt financing  private or public offerings of debt securities  or additional equity financings 
if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms  including upon maturity of the debt  we may be forced to dispose of hotel properties on disadvantageous terms  potentially resulting in losses that reduce cash flow from operating activities 
if  at the time of any refinancing  prevailing interest rates or other factors result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  increases in interest expense would lower our cash flow  and  consequently  cash available for distribution to our shareholders

table of contents derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effects of interest rate changes 
as of december   approximately of the company s borrowings were subject to variable rates 
the company limits the risks associated with interest rate changes by following established risk management policies and procedures which may include the use of derivatives 
for interest rate exposures  derivatives are used primarily to align rate movements between interest rates associated with the company s hotel operating revenue  participating lease revenue and other financial assets with interest rates on related debt  and manage the cost of borrowing obligations 
the company may utilize derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risk 
the company requires that hedging derivative instruments be effective in reducing the interest rate risk exposure that they are designated to hedge 
this effectiveness is essential in order to qualify for hedge accounting 
instruments that meet these hedging criteria are formally designated as hedges at the inception of the derivative contract 
when the terms of an underlying transaction are modified  or when the underlying hedged item ceases to exist  all changes in the fair value of the instrument are marked to market with changes in value included in net income each period until the instrument matures 
the company did not utilize any derivative financial instruments during the years through and there were no derivatives outstanding as of december  or item a

thereafter total fixed rate debt weighted average interest variable rate debt weighted average interest total the table above presents the principal amount of debt maturing each year  including annual amortization of principal  through december  and thereafter and weighted average interest rates for the debt maturing in each specified period 
this table reflects indebtedness outstanding as of december  and does not reflect indebtedness  if any  incurred after that date 
the company s ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of adjustment  the ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
as of december   the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate mortgage debt was million 
the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
the company seeks to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower the overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring the company s variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
as of december   million of the company s aggregate indebtedness of total indebtedness was subject to variable interest rates 
if market rates of interest on the company s variable rate long term debt fluctuate by  interest expense would increase or decrease  depending on rate movement  future earnings and cash flows by million annually 
this assumes that the amount outstanding under the company s variable rate debt remains at million  the balance as of december
