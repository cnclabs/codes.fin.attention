company overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing innovative small molecule drugs for the treatment of cancer and immune mediated diseases 
our mission and goal is to build a viable biopharmaceutical company that commercializes novel therapies intended to improve quality of life  increase duration of life and resolve serious unmet medical healthcare needs 
we identify promising product candidates using our scientific development expertise  develop our products in a rapid  cost efficient manner and pursue commercialization and or development partners when and where appropriate 
presently  we have three product candidates in clinical development and several preclinical molecules in lead optimization 
to date  substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to the research and development of our products  and we have not generated any commercial revenues from the sale of our products 
we do not anticipate the generation of any product commercial revenues until we receive the necessary regulatory and marketing approvals to launch one of our products 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception in  and as of june   had an accumulated deficit of  the process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant research and development  preclinical testing  clinical trials and manufacturing arrangements as well as regulatory and marketing approvals 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to result in significant operating losses until the commercialization of our products  or partner collaborations  generate sufficient revenues to cover our expenses 
we expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
achieving profitability depends upon our ability to successfully complete the development of our products  obtain required regulatory approvals and successfully commercialize our products 
bruton s tyrosine kinase btk inhibitor for oncology pci is an orally active small molecule inhibitor of bruton s tyrosine kinase btk that we are developing for the treatment of patients with b cell lymphoma or leukemia 
b cell maturation is mediated by b cell receptor bcr signal transduction and btk is an essential part of the bcr signaling pathway 
recently  btk has been demonstrated to affect a number of vital growth and survival processes in cancerous b cells 
as reported at the asco annual meeting in june  in a phase ib ii trial in cll sll  single agent pci has been well tolerated  discontinuation of treatment for adverse events occurred in of patients 
diarrhea  nausea vomiting  and dyspepsia were the most frequently reported events and were typically of modest severity 
significant neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were uncommon in the mg qd cohorts  but more frequently observed  respectively in the mg qd cohort in spite of a shorter follow up 
as previously reported  a characteristic pattern of response occurred in the cll patients  with rapid reduction of lymph node disease and a corresponding initial phase of lymphocytosis  which is an increase in the amount of lymphocytes a type of white blood cell 
the resolution of lymphocytosis was more rapid in treatment na ve versus relapsed refractory patients  corresponding to a more rapid evolution of overall response per standard criteria in treatment na ve patients 
at a median follow up of months  of patients with treatment na ve disease had achieved an overall response by standard criteria  with an additional of patients achieving a nodal response 
at a median follow up of months in the cohort of relapsed refractory patients treated with mg qd  the rate of overall objective response was with an additional of patients having achieved a nodal response 
the initial response assessment at months in patients with relapsed refractory disease appeared similar between the mg qd and mg qd doses 
additionally  achieving response appeared to be independent of poor risk features  such as del p  del q  and lack of mutation in the immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region gene 
through june   three patients have experienced disease progression  and of relapsed refractory patients in the more mature mg qd cohort are on treatment and free of progression at months 

table of contents in august  we entered into a five year cooperative research and development agreement with the national cancer institute nci to collaborate on the development of pci under the agreement  the nci division of cancer treatment and diagnosis plans to sponsor phase i and phase ii trials of pci in various hematologic malignancies 
we have initiated a phase ii program that will enable potential registrational paths in cll  mcl  and diffuse large b cell lymphoma dlbcl 
we anticipate that this phase ii program should allow for phase iii enabling decisions in these indications based upon ongoing analysis of the data 
the ongoing phase ii program currently includes the following studies pcyc a multicenter  phase ii study of pci in relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma  including cohorts of subjects either previously treated with bortezomib or na ve to bortezomib treatment 
this trial is activated in several us sites and is currently enrolling patients 
pcyc a multicenter  open label  phase ii study of pci in subjects with relapsed or refractory dlbcl 
this study is designed to assess the activity of pci in two genetically distinct subtypes of dlbcl  the activated b cell abc subtype and the germinal center gc subtype 
this trial is activated in several us sites and is currently enrolling patients 
pcyc a phase ib  multicenter  open label  study of pci  in combination with intensive immune chemotherapy fcr or br in subjects with cll or sll lymphoma 
this trial is activated in several us sites and is currently enrolling patients 
fcr fludarabine  cyclophosphamide and rituximab  br bendamustine and rituximab pcyc a phase ib ii study of pci and ofatumumab in subjects with relapsed or refractory cll or sll 
this is a single site trial and is currently enrolling patients 
factor viia inhibitor pci is a potent and selective first in human small molecule inhibitor of coagulation clotting factor viia 
pci suppresses the active form of factor vii fviia that arises from interaction with the cell surface membrane protein known as tissue factor tf 
the fviia tf complex is found at elevated levels in cancers of the pancreas  stomach  colon and lung 
the activity of this complex triggers a host of patho physiologic processes that facilitate tumor blood vessel formation angiogenesis  growth and metastases 
in pancreatic cancer patients  elevated levels of the fviia tf complex correlates with an increased propensity to develop thromboses  also known as blood clots 
studies in laboratory animals indicate that pci inhibits the growth of tumors that express tf 

table of contents we have completed phase i testing of factor viia inhibitor pci in healthy volunteers 
in this study  pci caused no adverse events  and we were able to establish the international normalized ratio inr as a pharmacodynamic marker for evaluation in clinical trials 
a multicenter phase i ii of pci in patients with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer that are either receiving or are planned to receive gemcitabine therapy is currently ongoing 
the phase i portion of the study  which evaluated safety and established the phase ii dose of pci  has completed enrollment and interim results were reported at the gi cancers symposium on january  the phase ii portion of the study is enrolling and patients are being randomized to receive either gemcitabine alone or gemcitabine plus pci mg kg twice daily 
the objectives of this phase of the study are to a assess the safety of pharmacyclics fviia inhibitor pci at pharmacologically active dose levels  b to assess potential inhibition of tumor progression and c obtain initial information of the effects on the incidence of thromboembolic events 
histone deacetylase hdac inhibitor pci is an orally bioavailable histone deacetylase inhibitor that is currently in multiple clinical trials 
histone deacetylases are cellular enzymes whose functions include turning gene expression off and on 
pci targets histone deacetylase hdac enzymes and inhibits their function 
we have shown that pci impacts the tumor cells by multiple mechanisms including a re expression of tumor suppressor genes  disruption of dna repair mechanisms  cell cycle inhibition and the generation of reactive oxygen species 
previous clinical trials have demonstrated that our hdac inhibitor pci has favorable systemic elimination properties when dosed orally  and inhibits the target enzymes 
clinical response or control of tumor growth has been recorded in three single agent clinical trials to date 
we are currently conducting a phase i trial in patients with advanced solid tumors  a phase i ii trial in sarcoma patients in combination with doxorubicin  an anti tumor agent and a phase i ii trial testing pci in patients with relapsed or refractory non hodgkin lymphoma 
currently we are enrolling patients in the phase ii portion of this trial in patients with follicular lymphoma 
the hdac inhibitor pci has been studied in over patients treated in clinical trials thus far 
the main dose limiting toxicity observed has been a rapidly reversible thrombocytopenia a decrease in platelets  which are blood cells necessary for clotting 
this effect is common among hdac inhibitors and is considered a class effect ie related to the pharmacologic mechanism of action 
the duration and severity of the thrombocytopenia has been managed using novel dose scheduling strategies that we have developed and tested in the clinic 
we are subject to risks common to pharmaceutical companies developing products  including risks inherent in our research  development and commercialization efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  uncertainty of regulatory and marketing approvals  uncertainty of market acceptance of our products  history of and expectation of future operating losses  reliance on collaborative partners  enforcement of patent and proprietary rights  and the need for future capital 
in order for a product to be commercialized  we must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate efficacy and safety of our product candidates to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities  obtain marketing approval  enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  build a us commercial capability  obtain market acceptance and  in many cases  obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for our products from government and private insurers 
we cannot provide assurance that we will generate revenues or achieve and sustain profitability in the future 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition and clinical trial accruals 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results  however  may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions and may adversely affect the financial statements 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and accompanying notes 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue under our license and collaboration arrangements is recognized based on the performance requirements of the contract 
amounts received under such arrangements consist of up front collaboration payments  periodic milestone payments and payments for research activities 
our collaborations prior to july  with multiple elements were evaluated and divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria were met  including whether the delivered element had stand alone value and whether there was verifiable objective and reliable evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we received was combined and recognized as a single unit of accounting when criteria for separation were not met 
future collaborations with multiple elements will follow the separation criteria in accounting standards update revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue will be allocated to each element using a selling price hierarchy  where the selling price for an element is based on vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe  if available and vsoe is not available  or the best estimate of selling price  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
up front payments under agreements which include future performance requirements are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized over the performance period 
the performance period is estimated at the inception of the arrangement and is reevaluated at each reporting period 
the reevaluation of the performance period may shorten or lengthen the period during which the deferred revenue is recognized 
revenues related to substantive  at risk collaboration milestones are recognized upon achievement of the event specified in the underlying agreement 
revenues for research activities are recognized as the related research efforts are performed 
research and development expenses and accruals research and development expenses include personnel and facility related expenses  outside contracted services including clinical trial costs  manufacturing and process development costs  research costs and other consulting services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
in the normal course of business we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the on going development of potential products 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful enrollment of patients  the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
as such  expense accruals related to clinical trials are recognized based on our estimate of the degree of completion of the event or events specified in the specific clinical study or trial contract 

table of contents share based compensation share based compensation cost for employee stock options is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award 
the accounting grant date for employee stock options with performance obligations is the date on which the performance goals have been defined and a mutual understanding of the terms has been reached 
generally options with performance obligations vest over a four year period  with the goals set and agreed upon annually 
share based compensation for non employee stock options is re estimated at each period end through the vesting date 
the fair value of each stock option is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility data of our stock 
the expected term of stock options granted is based on historical data and represents the period of time that stock options are expected to be outstanding 
the expected term for each of our employee options  non employee options and our employee stock purchase plan is calculated for and applied to one group of grants as we do not expect substantially different exercise or post vesting termination behavior among our employee or non employee population 
the risk free interest rate is based on a zero coupon united states treasury bond whose maturity period equals the expected term of the our options 
options vest upon the passage of time or a combination of time and the achievement of certain performance obligations 
the compensation committee of the board of directors will determine if the performance conditions have been met 
share based compensation expense for the options with performance obligations is recorded when the company believes that the vesting of these options is probable

results of operations revenues the following table summarizes our revenue over the last three fiscal years in thousands license and milestone revenues we recorded  and  in revenue in the years ended june  and  respectively  associated with our collaboration and license agreement with servier which was entered into in april given that the deliverables under the collaboration agreement with servier did not meet criteria in the accounting rules for separation eg  no separately identifiable fair value  the arrangement has been treated as a single unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
we recognized the combined unit of accounting over the estimated period required to complete the research activities two years  which coincided with the delivery period for all substantive obligations or deliverables associated with this agreement 
of the total revenue for the year ended june    represents amortization of the  upfront payment from servier received in april and the remainder represents the pro rata completion of services associated with research payments  our supply commitment and reimbursement of patent expenses 

table of contents the collaboration and license agreement required us to enter into an agreement to supply drug product for servier s use in clinical trials 
as the supply agreement was considered part of the arrangement we deferred recognition of all revenue under the servier collaboration agreement until the supply agreement was completed and executed in our fiscal second quarter 
of the total research and development collaboration revenues for the year ended june    represent amortization of the  upfront payment from servier received in april included in the servier revenue recognized in fiscal was  which represents the pro rata portion of revenue attributable to the period from april ie  the signing of the collaboration agreement to june   had the supply agreement been completed in april the remaining fiscal revenue of  represents the pro rata completion of services attributable to payments of  from servier associated with research payments  our supply commitment and reimbursements of patent expenses 
research and development expenses the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our research and development r d expenses over the last three fiscal years in thousands change change r d expenses research and development costs are identified as either directly attributed to one of our research and development programs or as an indirect cost  with only direct costs being tracked by specific program 
direct costs consist of personnel costs directly associated with a program  preclinical study costs  clinical trial costs  and related clinical drug and device development and manufacturing costs  drug formulation costs  contract services and other research expenditures 
indirect costs consist of personnel costs not directly associated with a program  overhead and facility costs and other support service expenses 
the following table summarizes our principal product development initiatives  including the related stages of development for each product  the direct costs attributable to each product and total indirect costs for each respective period 
for a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with the timing and cost of completing a product development phase  see the risk factors discussed in this annual report 
prior to fiscal  we did not track our research and development expenses by specific program and for this reason we cannot accurately estimate our total historical costs on a specific program basis

table of contents research and development expenses increased  or  for the year ended june  compared with the year ended june  the increase  which is net of approximately   net of  in related expenses received from a therapeutic discovery project tax credit  was primarily due to the following btk program costs increased  or  driven by increased clinical trial activity 
increases included  in outside clinical trial costs   in drug related costs   in personnel costs   in outside services and consulting costs and  in lab supplies 
hdac program costs decreased  or 
decreases included  in personnel costs and  in outside services and consulting costs  partially offset by higher outside clinical trial costs  drug costs and lab supplies 
factor vlla program costs decreased  or 
decreases included  in drug costs and  in outside services and consulting costs  partially offset by higher outside clinical trial and personnel costs 
indirect costs increased  or  primarily due to an increase of  in share based compensation costs  partially offset by lower other indirect personnel related costs 
research and development expenses increased  or for the year ended june  compared with the year ended june  primarily due to the following btk program costs increased  or primarily due to increases of  in personnel costs   in drug costs   in outside clinical trial costs   in preclinical costs   in outside services and consulting costs and other increases associated with the increased activity 
hdac program costs decreased  or primarily due to a  payment in the prior year associated with the amendment of our license agreement with celera 
factor vlla program costs increased  or primarily due to increases of  in drug costs and  in outside clinical trial costs 
mgd program costs decreased  or primarily due to decreases of  in personnel costs and  in consulting costs 
indirect costs increased  or primarily due to an increase of  in share based compensation costs 
general and administrative expenses 
the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our general and administrative g a expenses over the last three fiscal years 
change change g a expenses the increase of or  in general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  compared with the year ended june   was primarily due to a non cash increase in share based compensation of  a  increase in legal and patent costs and a  increase in recruiting and payroll costs 
these increases were partially offset by a  net decrease in consulting and other advisory services in 
table of contents the decrease of or  in general and administrative expenses for the year ended june  compared with the year ended june   was primarily due to a non cash decrease in share based compensation of  and a  decrease in other payroll related costs that were primarily due to the absence of significant severance costs in these decreases were partially offset by a fiscal increase of  in financial advisory expenses and  related to the provision of certain legal and patent outside services 
interest and other income expense  net 
the following table summarizes the period over period changes in our interest and other income  net  over the last three fiscal years 
change change interest income interest expense other  net interest and other income expense  net the increase of  in interest and other income expense  net  for the year ended june  compared with the year ended june   was primarily due to higher interest income from higher invested balances during the year and the absence of interest expense in the increase of  in interest and other income expense  net  for the year ended june  compared with the year ended june   was primarily due to a decrease of  in interest expense due to settlement of the related party loans  partially offset by a  reduction of interest income due to lower average interest rates 
income taxes 
at june   we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  and  respectively 
approximately  of the federal net operating loss carry forwards relate to stock option deductions  the tax benefit of which will be accounted for directly to equity as additional paid in capital as they are utilized 
the federal and state net operating loss carry forwards will begin to expire in federal and state tax credit carry forwards of  and  respectively  are available to offset future taxable income 
the federal tax credits will begin to expire in state research and development credits can be carried forward indefinitely 
under the tax reform act of  the amounts of and the benefit from net operating losses and tax credit carry forwards that can be carried forward may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances 
these circumstances include  but are not limited to  a cumulative stock ownership change of greater than  as defined  over a three year period 
this annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses before utilization 
we have determined that a cumulative stock ownership change happened and we have estimated that a significant portion of our net operating losses for federal and state tax purposes  as well as some amount of our federal research credits  will not be available for use in future periods due to these limitation rules 
the above estimated net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards reflect a reduction for the amounts we have estimated will expire unused 
in the year ended june   we recorded a  income tax provision as result of withholding taxes on the  upfront licensing payment received from servier 
in the year ended june   we recorded a  income tax receivable related to a tax credit resulting from a december tax treaty revision enacted between france and the united states that eliminates withholding taxes related to licensing agreements and provides that prior withholding taxes may be reclaimed 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of working capital have been private and public equity financings and also proceeds from collaborative research and development agreements  as well as interest income 
since inception  we have used  of cash for operating activities and approximately  of cash for the purchase of laboratory and office equipment  leasehold improvements and payments under capital lease agreements 
as of june   we had  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
net cash used in operating activities of  during the year ended june  resulted primarily from our net loss partially offset by share based compensation expense and an increase in accounts payable 
net cash used in operating activities of  during the year ended june  resulted primarily from our net loss  a decrease in deferred revenue and an increase in prepaid and other assets  partially offset by share based compensation expense and an increase in accounts payable 
net cash used in operating activities was  for the year ended june  and resulted primarily from the operating loss partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue and non cash share based compensation expense net cash used in investing activities of  and  in the years ended june  and respectively  and net cash provided by investing activities in of  primarily consisted of the net effect of purchases  maturities and sales of marketable securities 
additionally  our purchases of property and equipment increased to  in from  in  largely due to purchases associated with the expansion of our leased facilities during the year 
net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended june  consisted of  in net proceeds from the sale of approximately million shares of common stock in a registered direct offering completed in june and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities of  for the year ended june  consisted primarily of  in net proceeds from the sale of approximately million shares of common stock in a rights offering completed in august  net proceeds of  from the sale of approximately million shares of common stock in a registered direct offering completed in june and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options and sale of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
net cash provided by financing activities of  in the year ended june  consisted of proceeds from notes payable and the sale of common stock 
in april  we signed a collaboration and license agreement with servier 
in may  we received an upfront payment from servier of  less applicable withholding taxes of  for a net payment of  the withholding tax will be reclaimed due to a revision in the double tax treaty between the us and france 
we received an additional  from servier for research collaboration in installments between and april and received a  advance milestone payment under the agreement in april see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  we borrowed  from an affiliate of robert w 
duggan 
in march  the loan amount was increased to  in august  pursuant to the terms of the loans  we repaid the  loans outstanding at june  through the issuance of shares in the rights offering 

table of contents based upon the current status of our product development plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs through at least the next twelve months 
we expect research and development expenses  as a result of on going and future clinical trials  to consume a large portion of our existing cash resources 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may affect actual future consumption of existing cash resources as well 
in any event  due to our extensive drug programs we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations in the future 
we may seek partnership collaborations to help fund the development of our product candidates 
we also expect to raise additional funds through the public or private sale of securities  bank debt  partnership collaboration or otherwise 
if we are unable to secure additional funds  whether through partnership collaborations or sale of our securities  we will have to delay  reduce the scope of or discontinue one or more of our product development programs 
our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the following progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approval  continued progress of our research and development programs  our ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with third parties  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the amount and timing of capital equipment purchases  and competing technological and market developments 
our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary materially 
the factors described above will impact our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
if we are required to raise additional funds  we cannot be certain that such additional funding will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity financing may be highly dilutive  or otherwise disadvantageous  to existing stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
collaborative arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms  would require us to reduce our operating expenses and would limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements to develop our product candidates and to continue operations  any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our primary noncancelable contractual obligations as of june  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than one year years years more than years operating lease obligations total 
table of contents in january  we entered into an amendment of our facilities lease agreement which added an additional  square feet of leased space  giving us a total of  square feet 
the amendment included an abatement of the monthly rent of the prior facility lease for the first months  limited to  and a month abatement for the added space  limited to  the amendment includes an option to extend the lease term for five years  an early termination fee of per sq 
ft and a relocation option 
the amended lease expires in november in addition  we have entered into various agreements and purchase orders related to our clinical trials and general operations which have been excluded from the above table because they are cancellable prior to the date of delivery 
in april  we acquired multiple small molecule drug candidates for the treatment of cancer and other diseases from celera genomics  an applera corporation business now celera corporation a subsidiary of quest diagnostics incorporated 
future milestone payments we could be required to make under the agreement  as amended  could total as much as approximately  although we currently cannot predict if or when any of the milestones will be achieved 
in addition  celera will also be entitled to royalty payments based on annual sales of certain drugs commercialized from these programs 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted due to fluctuations in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time improving yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies and high quality corporate issuers  and  by policy  restrict our exposure to any single corporate issuer by imposing concentration limits 
to minimize the exposure due to adverse shifts in interest rates  we generally maintain investments at an average maturity of less than two years 
assuming a hypothetical increase in interest rates of one percentage point  the fair value of our total investment portfolio as of june  and  would have potentially declined by approximately  and  respectively 
the table below presents the fair value of our marketable securities at june  and weighted average interest rates by year of stated maturity for our investment portfolio in thousands  except interest rates matures in fiscal year marketable securities weighted average interest rate
