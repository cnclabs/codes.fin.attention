item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we develop  manufacture  distribute and market specialty performance ingredients and products for the food  nutritional  pharmaceutical  animal health and medical device sterilization industries 
our reportable segments are strategic businesses that offer industrial products and services to different markets 
we presently have three reportable segments specialty products  food  pharma nutrition  and animal nutrition health 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report 
those statements in the following discussion that are not historical in nature should be considered to be forward looking statements that are inherently uncertain 
see cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements 
specialty products our specialty products segment operates in industry as arc specialty products 
ethylene oxide  at the level  is sold as a sterilant gas  primarily for use in the health care industry 
it is used to sterilize a wide range of medical devices because of its versatility and effectiveness in treating hard or soft surfaces  composites  metals  tubing and different types of plastics without negatively impacting the performance of the device being sterilized 
our ethylene oxide product is distributed in uniquely designed  recyclable  double walled  stainless steel drums to assure compliance with safety  quality and environmental standards as outlined the epa and the us department of transportation 
our inventory of these specially built drums  along with our two filling facilities  represents a significant capital investment 
contract sterilizers  medical device manufacturers  and medical gas distribut ors are our principal customers for this product 
in addition  we also sell single use canisters with ethylene oxide for use in medical device sterilization 
as a fumigant  ethylene oxide blends are highly effective in killing bacteria  fungi  and insects in spices and other seasoning materials 
in  the company acquired aberco  inc  a marketer and distributor of propylene oxide 
we sell propylene oxide as a fumigant to aid in the control of insects and microbiological spoilage  and to reduce bacterial and mold contamination in shell and processed nut meats except peanuts  processed spices  cacao beans  cocoa powder  raisins  figs and prunes 
we also sell propylene oxide to customers seeking smaller as opposed to bulk quantities and whose requirements include utilization in various chemical synthesis applications  to make paints more durable and for manufacturing specialty starches and textile coatings 
management believes that future success in this segment is highly dependent on the company s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent quality  safety and customer service 
food  pharma nutrition the food  pharma nutrition fpn segment provides microencapsulation solutions to a variety of applications in food  pharmaceutical and nutritional ingredients to enhance performance of nutritional fortification  processing  mixing  and packaging applications and shelf life 
major product applications are baked goods  refrigerated and frozen dough systems  processed meats  seasoning blends  confections  and nutritional supplements 
we also market human grade choline nutrient products through this segment for wellness applications 
choline is recognized to play a key role in the development and structural integrity of brain cell membranes in infants  processing dietary fat  reproductive development and neural functions  such as memory and muscle function 
the fpn portfolio also includes granulated calcium carb onate products  primarily used in  or in conjunction with  novel over the counter and prescription pharmaceuticals for the treatment of osteoporosis  gastric disorders and calcium deficiencies in the united states 
management believes this segment s key strengths are its proprietary technology and end product application capabilities 
the success of the company s efforts to increase revenue in this segment is highly dependent on the timing of marketing launches of new products in the us and international food and nutrition markets by the company s customers and prospects 
the company  through its innovative proprietary technology and applications expertise  continues to develop new products designed to solve and respond to customer problems and innovative needs 
animal nutrition health our animal nutrition health an h segment provides the animal nutrition market with nutritional products derived from our microencapsulation and chelation technologies in addition to basic choline chloride 
commercial sales of reashure choline  an encapsulated choline product  nitroshuretm  an encapsulated urea supplement  and niashuretm  our microencapsulated niacin product for dairy cows  boosts health and milk production in transition and lactating dairy cows  delivering nutrient supplements that survive the rumen and are biologically available  providing required nutritional levels 
we also market chelated mineral supplements for use in animal feed throughout the world  as our proprietary chelation technology provides enhanced nutrient absorption for various species of production and companion animals 
in october  we introduced the first proven rumen protected lysine for use in dairy rations  aminoshure l  which gives nutritionists and dairy producers a precise and consistent source of rumen protected lysine 
an h also manufactures and supplies basic choline chloride  an essential nutrient for animal health  predominantly to the poultry and swine industries 
choline  which is manufactured and sold in both dry and aqueous forms  plays a vital role in the metabolism of fat 
choline deficiency can result in reduced growth and perosis in poultry  fatty liver  kidney necrosis and general poor health condition in swine 
certain derivatives of choline chloride are also manufactured and sold into industrial applications 
the an h segment also includes the manufacture and sale of methylamines 
methylamines are a primary building block for the manufacture of choline products and are also used in a wide range of industrial applications 
sales of specialty products for the animal nutrition and health industry are highly dependent on dairy industry economics as well as the ability of the company to leverage the results of existing successful university research on the animal health benefits of the company s products 
management believes that success in the commodity oriented basic choline chloride marketplace is highly dependent on the company s ability to maintain its strong reputation for excellent product quality and customer service 
in addition  the company must continue to increase production efficiencies in order to maintain its low cost position to effectively compete in a highly competitive global marketplace 
the company sells products for all three segments through its own sales force  independent distributors  and sales agents 
the following tables summarize consolidated net sales by segment and business segment earnings from operations for the three years ended december   and in thousands business segment net sales specialty products food  pharma nutrition animal nutrition health total business segment earnings from operations specialty products food  pharma nutrition animal nutrition health total fiscal year compared to fiscal year all amounts in thousands  except share and per share data net sales net sales for were  as compared with  for  an increase of  or 
net sales for the specialty products segment were  for  as compared with  for  an increase of  or 
this increase in sales was derived principally from an increase in volumes sold of propylene oxide products  a result of our recent acquisition of a marketer and distributor of propylene oxide for use in the fumigation of certain nut meats and spice fumigation  along with modest price increases for our ethylene oxide products for medical device sterilization 
net sales for the food  pharma nutrition segment were  for compared with  for  an increase of  or 
this result was driven principally by a volume increase in the domestic food sector  primarily due to higher volumes of encapsulated ingredients for baking  preservation and confection markets 
also contributing to the increase was higher sales of human choline products for both food applications and the supplement markets 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales of calcium products and vitashure products for nutritional enhancement 
net sales of  were realized for for the animal nutrition health segment  as compared with  for the prior year comparable period  an increase of  or 
global feed grade choline product sales improved by approximately 
sales within north america improved approximately over the prior year however  overall north american produced feed grade choline declined in the year 
exports of liquid and dry choline from our north american plants declined largely due to currency issues and  in combination with glob al competition  resulted in our declining to bid on certain international business 
sales of our italian produced choline sold into markets outside of north america improved approximately over the prior year 
the anh specialty ingredients  largely targeted to the ruminant and companion animal markets  realized sales growth from the prior year comparable quarter  as some regional improvement in dairy economics supported greater demand for these products  particularly with strong sales of reashure  chelated minerals and aminoshure l  our rumen protected lysine 
sales of industrial grade products being sold for various industrial applications  predominantly in north america  but also in europe realized significant growth from the prior year and comprise approximately of the sales in this segment f or the year 
gross margin gross margin for increased to  compared to  for  an increase of 
gross margin percentage for was  as compared to for the prior year comparable period  as the benefits of increased sales volumes were offset primarily by higher petro chemical based raw material costs 
gross margin percentage for the specialty products segment decreased by primarily due to the aforementioned higher petro chemical based raw material costs 
gross margin percentage in the food  pharma nutrition segment increased by  as margins were favorably affected by increased sales volumes  improved product mix and plant efficiencies 
gross margin percentage in the animal nutrition and health segment decreased by principally from increases in the cost of certa in petro chemical raw materials used to manufacture choline 
operating expenses operating expenses for were  as compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily due to increased costs related to the aberco acquisition  recruiting fees  a modest increase of employee headcount  relocation expenses  and consultancy fees partially offset by a reduction in outside contract research expense  principally due to the timing of these activities  and accounts receivable reserves for international accounts that were an expense reserve item in the prior year comparable period 
operating expenses were of sales or percentage points less than the operating expenses as a percent of sales in last year comparable period 
during and  the company spent  and  respectively  on research and development programs  substantially all of which pertained to the company s food  pharma nutrition and animal nutrition health segments 
business segment earnings from operations earnings from operations for increased to  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase was principally driven by increased sales volumes over the prior year comparable period  partially offset primarily by higher petro chemical based raw material costs 
earnings from operations as a percentage of sales operating margin for increased to compared to for  principally a result of the aforementioned higher sales volumes being partially offset by higher petro chemical based raw material costs 
the company is continuing to focus on volume growth with new product launches into both domestic and international markets  as well as capitalizing on its varied choline production capabilities 
earnings from ope rations for the specialty products segment were  an increase of  or  primarily due to increased sales volumes being offset by higher petro chemical based raw material costs and increased expenses related to development work on our erc technology for repackaging  distribution and delivery of a product for the fruit ripening industry 
earnings from operations for food  pharma nutrition were  an increase of  or  due largely to the aforementioned increased sales volumes  favorable product mix and plant efficiencies 
earnings from operations for animal nutrition health increased by  to  a increase from the prior year comparable period  principally from favorable operating variances due to the volume improvement in both sales and production 
also contributing to the improvement was the aforementioned reduction in outside contract research expense and accounts receivable reserves for international accounts that were an expe nse reserve item in last year s comparable period 
these improvements were partially offset by increases in the cost of certain petro chemical raw materials used to manufacture choline 
other expenses income interest income for totaled as compared to for  a result of higher average cash balances in interest expense was for compared to for this decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in average current and long term debt resulting from normal recurring principal payments 
other income of includes a non recurring net gain of approximately related to the sale of a non core calcium carbonate product line and favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar the reporting currency and functional foreign currencies 
income tax expense the company s effective tax rate for and was and respectively

fiscal year compared to fiscal year all amounts in thousands  except share and per share data net sales net sales for were  as compared with  for  a decrease of  or 
net sales for the specialty products segment were  for  as compared with  for  an increase of or 
this increase in sales was derived principally from increases in the average selling prices of certain ethylene oxide products for medical device sterilization adopted to help offset rising raw material costs during this increase was partially offset by a decline in volumes sold of propylene oxide for starch modification 
net sales for the food  pharma nutrition segment were  for  as compared with  for  a decrease of or 
this result was driven principally by aggressive inventory management by customers along with volume declines in the human grade ch oline and calcium products for the supplement market  which has been negatively impacted by the worldwide economic downturn 
these declines were partially offset by a favorable product mix sold in the domestic food market  including the growth of choline into new food applications as well as growth in the bakery  tortilla and preservation markets 
also offsetting the declines were increased sales of vitashure products for nutritional enhancement 
net sales of  were realized in for the animal nutrition health segment  as compared with  for  a decrease of  or 
feed and industrial grade choline product sales and derivatives decreased or  over the prior year period  principally from well publicized softness in the us poultry and swine markets 
there were also lower export sales from our north american choline plants  largely due to the stronger us dollar in versus and international political factors affect ing poultry exports 
this us volume decline was partially offset by increased volumes of choline products sourced from our italian operation into the european and international poultry markets 
this geographic mix lowered consolidated feed grade prices in the period  as did lower pricing linked to the decline in raw material costs 
sales of industrial derivatives both choline and methylamines were impacted by softness in the industrial sector  principally caused by the general economic downturn 
sales of our specialty animal nutrition and health products  targeted for ruminant production animals and companion animals  increased or from the prior year comparable period as some late year improvement in dairy economics created greater demand for certain products  particularly chelates and rumen protected lysine 
partially offsetting this increase were declines in certain other specialty animal nutrition and health products  targeted for ruminant production animals and companion animals largely due to due to weak dairy economics in which resulted in lower demand for these products 
gross margin gross margin for increased to  compared to  for  an increase of 
gross margin percentage for was  as compared to  for  as our margin percentage was favorably affected by product mix  lower raw material and energy costs and price increases implemented in early gross margin percentage for the specialty products segment increased by primarily due to price increases implemented in early gross margin percentage in the encapsulated nutritional products segment decreased as margins were unfavorably affected by the aforementioned aggressive inventory management by customers and volume declines in the human grade choline and calcium products for the supplement market 
gross margin percentage in animal nutrition and health increased principally from reductions in the cost of certain petro chemical raw materials and improved production supply chain efficiencies in both the us and europe 
operating expenses operating expenses for were  as compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase was due primarily to increased payroll expenses  an increase to some accounts receivable reserves for international accounts and non cash stock based compensation recognition 
with these increases  operating expenses were of sales or percentage points greater than the operating expenses as a percent of sales incurred in during and  the company spent  and  respectively  on research and development  substantially all of which pertained to the food  pharma nutrition  and animal nutrition health segments 
business segment earnings from operations earnings from operations for increased to  compared to  for  an increase of  or 
this increase was primarily driven by cost reductions of certain petro chemical raw materials over the prior year  a favorable product mix  and plant and logistics efficiencies 
earnings from operations as a percentage of sales operating margin for increased to compared to for  principally a result of the aforementioned cost reductions of certain petro chemical raw materials over the prior year comparable period  a favorable product mix  and plant and logistics efficiencies 
earnings from operations for the specialty products segment were  an increase of  or  primarily due to reductions in the cost of certain petro chemical raw materials and increases in average selling prices 
earnings from operations for food  pharma nutrition were  a decrease of or  due largely to the aforementioned aggressive inventory management by customers and volume declines in the human grade choline and calcium products for the supplement market 
earnings from operations for animal nutrition health increased by  to  an increase from the prior year  resulting principally from reductions in the cost of certain petro chemical raw materials and improved production supply chain efficiencies in both the us and europe 
other expenses income interest income totaled in each of and interest expense  net of capitalized interest  was for compared to for this decrease is primarily attributable to the decrease in average current and long term debt resulting from both normal recurring principal payments as well as accelerated payments of the term loan as defined below in the financing activities section of liquidity and capital resources 
other income of for is primarily the result of favorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar the reporting currency and functional foreign currencies 
income tax expense the company s effective tax rate in and was and  respectively 
this increase in the effective tax rate is primarily attributable to a change in apportionment relating to state income taxes  as well as a change in the income proportion towards jurisdictions with higher tax rates

critical accounting policies management of the company is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company s critical accounting policies are those that require application of management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
management considers the following accounting policies to be critical 
revenue recognition revenue  for each of our business segments is recognized upon product shipment  passage of title and risk of loss  and when collection is reasonably assured 
the company reports amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling as revenue and includes costs incurred for shipping and handling in cost of sales 
amounts received for unshipped merchandise are principally not recognized as revenue but rather they are recorded as customer deposits and are included in current liabilities 
in instances of shipments made on consignment  revenue is deferred until a customer indicates to the company that it has used the company s products 
the company does not charge its customers rental fees on cylinders or drums used to ship its products 
in addition  the company follows the provisions of asc topic   revenue recognition incorporating the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition which sets forth guidelines on the timing of revenue recognition based upon factors such as passage of title  payments and customer acceptance 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess or obsolete inventories 
the write down of potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is recorded based on management s assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  which is generally based on discounted cash flows 
goodwill  which is not subject to amortization  is tested annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
if an indicator of impairment exists  the company determines the amount of impairment based on a comparison of the implied fair value of its goodwill to its carrying value 
we also perform impairment analyses whenever events and circumstances indicate that goodwill or certain intangibles may be impaired 
in accordance with the asc topic  we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we utilize our three operating segments as our goodwill reporting units as we have discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management and businesses within each segment have similar economic characteristics 
for the year ended december   the company s three reporting units were specialty products  food  pharma nutrition  and animal nutrition health 
we have historically assessed  and continue to assess  the fair value of our reporting units by solely utilizing the income approach  based on a discounted cash flow valuation model as the basis for our conclusions  as we feel this provides the most reliable valuation indicator bas ed on our long term projections for each reporting unit 
our estimates of future cash flows include significant management assumptions such as revenue growth rates  operating margins  discount rates  estimated terminal value and future economic and market conditions 
these valuation procedures are consistent with goodwill impairment tests performed in prior years 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test as of december   which indicated no impairment of goodwill  as the estimated fair values substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units 
in addition  with the exception of an asset writedown related to the sale of a product line  there were no triggering events which required asset impairment reviews and the undiscounted cash flows associated with our property  plant and equipment and other long lived intangible assets were well in excess of the carrying value of these asset classes 
accounts receivable we market our products to a diverse customer base  principally throughout the united states  europe  china and japan 
we grant credit terms in the normal course of business to our customers 
we perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer current credit worthiness  as determined through review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
estimated losses are based on historical experience and any specific customer collection issues identified 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payment s  additional allowances and related bad debt expense may be required 
post employment benefits the company provides life insurance and health care benefits for eligible retirees and health care benefits for retirees eligible survivors 
the costs and obligations related to these benefits reflect the company s assumptions as to general economic conditions and health care cost trends 
the cost of providing plan benefits also depends on demographic assumptions including retirements  mortality  turnover  and plan participation 
if actual experience differs from these assumptions  the cost of providing these benefits could increase or decrease 
in accordance with asc  compensation retirement benefits  the company is required to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position  and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
intangible assets with finite lives the useful life of an intangible asset is based on the company s assumptions regarding expected use of the asset  the relationship of the intangible asset to another asset or group of assets  any legal  regulatory or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life of the asset or that enable renewal or extension of the asset s legal or contractual life without substantial cost  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset and their related impact on the asset s useful life 
if events or circumstances indicate that the life of an intangible asset has changed  it could result in higher future amortization charges or recognition of an impairment loss 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company regularly reviews its deferred tax assets for recoverability and would establish a valuation allowance if it believed that such assets may not be recovered  taking into consideration historical operating results  expectations of future earnings  changes in its operations and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes utilizing asc asc clarifies whether or not to recognize assets or liabilities for tax positions taken that may be challenged by a tax authority 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  and disclosures 
the application of asc requires judgment related to the uncertainty in income taxes and could impact our effective tax rate 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating our stock price volatility  employee stock option exercise behaviors and employee option forfeiture rates 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of the company s stock 
the expected term of the options is based on the company s historical experience of employees exer cise behavior 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of asc  the compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk cash and cash equivalents are invested primarily in money market accounts 
the company has no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments  nor does the company have any financial instruments entered into for trading or hedging purposes 
as of december   the company s borrowings were under a bank term loan bearing interest at euribor plus 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  applied to the company s borrowings at december   would result in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense and a corresponding reduction or increase in cash flow of approximately the company is exposed to market risks for changes in foreign currency rates and has exposure to commodity price risks  including prices of our primary raw materials 
our objective is to seek a reduction in the potential negative earnings impact of changes in foreign exchange rates and raw material pricing arising in our business activities 
the company manages these financial exposures  where possible  through pricing and operational means 
our practices may change as economic conditions change
