item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview parkway is a self administered and self managed reit specializing in the acquisition  operations  leasing and ownership of office properties 
the company is geographically focused on the southeastern and southwestern united states and chicago 
at march   parkway owned or had an interest in office properties located in states with an aggregate of approximately million square feet of leasable space 
included in the portfolio are properties totaling million square feet that are owned jointly with other investors  representing of the portfolio 
with the office properties owned jointly with other investors  the company receives fees for asset management  property management  leasing and construction management services and potentially receives incentive fees upon sale if certain investment targets are achieved 
increasing the number of co investments  and consequently the related fee income  is part of the company s strategy to transform itself to an operator owner versus an owner operator 
the strategy capitalizes on the company s strength in providing excellent service in the operation and acquisition of office properties for investment clients in addition to its direct ownership of real estate assets 
fee based real estate services are offered through the company s wholly owned subsidiary  parkway realty services llc  which also currently manages and or leases approximately million square feet for third party owners 
the company generates revenue primarily by leasing office space to its customers and providing management and leasing services to third party office property owners including joint venture interests 
the primary drivers behind parkway s revenues are occupancy  rental rates and customer retention 
occupancy 
parkway s revenues are dependent on the occupancy of its office buildings 
at january   occupancy of parkway s office portfolio was compared to at october  and at january  not included in the january  occupancy rate  are the acquisition of the peachtree office property on january   as well as signed leases totaling  square feet  which commence during the period from the first quarter of through the second quarter of including these leases and the acquisition of peachtree  the company s portfolio was leased at january  the company currently anticipates customers occupying approximately  square feet to either vacate or contract upon expiration during the first quarter of  but also expects its leasing volume to be in line with historical levels 
parkway currently projects an average annual occupancy range of to during for its office properties 
to combat rising vacancy  parkway utilizes innovative approaches to produce new leases 
these include the broker bill of rights  a short form service agreement and customer advocacy programs which are models in the industry and have historically helped the company maintain occupancy above the national occupancy rate of approximately 
rental rates 
an increase in vacancy rates has the effect of reducing market rental rates and vice versa 
parkway s leases typically have three to seven year terms 
as leases expire  the company replaces the existing leases with new leases at the current market rental rate 
at january   parkway had per square foot in rental rate embedded loss in its office property leases 
embedded loss is defined as the difference between the weighted average in place cash rents and the weighted average market rental rate 
customer retention 
keeping existing customers is important as high customer retention leads to increased occupancy  less downtime between leases  and reduced leasing costs 
parkway estimates that it costs five to six times more to replace an existing customer with a new one than to retain the customer 
in making this estimate  parkway takes into account the sum of revenue lost during downtime on the space plus leasing costs  which rise as market vacancies increase 
therefore  parkway focuses a great amount of energy on customer retention 
parkway operating philosophy is based on the premise that it is in the customer retention business 
parkway seeks to retain its customers by continually focusing on operations at its office properties 
the company believes in providing superior customer service  hiring  training  retaining and empowering each employee  and creating an environment of open communication both internally and externally with customers and stockholders 
over the past ten years  parkway maintained an average customer retention rate 
parkway s customer retention rate was for the quarter ended december   as compared to for the quarter ended september   and for the quarter ended december  customer retention for the year ended december  and was and  respectively 
strategic planning 
parkway is a focused office reit with a hands on  service oriented approach  a disciplined capital allocation program and willingness to recycle assets 
parkway continues to focus on the company s strategy of transforming itself to an operator owner from an owner operator  as well as maximizing total return to our stockholders 
to show our commitment to this goal  our newest strategic plan is centered on a goal of achieving a compounded annual total return to our shareholders over a three year period 
this plan is known as the focus plan the plan  which began july  and will extend three full years through june  the goals of the plan are as follows page of fund and fund like investments 
the company believes that fund and fund like investments have the highest priority of the company s capital allocation  because it gives parkway s stockholders the highest risk adjusted return as measured by internal rate of return  capitalization rate and accretion per share 
operator owner 
the company plans to make a full transformation to an operator owner  with the goal of being a majority operator owner by the end of the plan 
this has been a goal for several years and will continue to be a core strategy as parkway seeks to increase fee income and maximize its return on equity and accretion per share 
additionally  the company will continue to expand prs  which offers expert real estate management guidance  professional property management services and strategic marketing and leasing services aimed at increasing net operating income and maximizing profit upon exit 
capital allocation discipline 
the company s overall capital structure goal is to achieve a net debt to gross asset value ratio of or less  as determined by using a capitalization rate of on recurring cash income  and a net debt to ebitda multiple of times or less 
beyond the balance sheet  capital allocation refers to the company s goal to exit non strategic markets through the continuation of its asset recycling program 
most of the properties identified for sale are smaller assets or assets located in smaller markets where parkway does not have a significant presence 
by the end of the focus plan  the company s goal is to be invested in larger  higher quality properties located in higher rent growth markets through fund and fund like investments 
the company will continue to maintain discipline as it relates to managing the balance sheet and the acquisition and disposition of assets 
uncompromising focus on operations 
parkway believes that its uncompromising focus on operations is what sets it apart from other office property owners 
an important goal of the focus plan is to move decision making authority to the regional office level 
the company s market leaders already have the responsibility of setting rents  increasing net operating income margins and maintaining a consistent standard of operations and will be given more profit and loss responsibility and investment authority going forward 
it is important that we know our markets  which is best achieved when parkway s people live and work within the market 
an integral part of the focus plan is a program referred to as we know city 
these three words imply that parkway employees know more than just how to manage real estate  but that they have a deep understanding of a city s history  economics  infrastructure  politics and much more 
by truly knowing the cities where the company is invested  we are better positioned for leasing  active asset management  recruitment and investments

in addition  the company monitors interest  fixed charge and modified fixed charge coverage ratios as well as the net debt to gross asset value ratio and the net debt to ebitda multiple

ebitda  as calculated by us  is not comparable to ebitda reported by other reits that do not define ebitda exactly as we do 
page of the company believes that ebitda helps investors and parkway s management analyze the company s ability to service debt and pay cash distributions 
however  the material limitations associated with using ebitda as a non gaap financial measure compared to cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities are that ebitda does not reflect the company s historical cash expenditures or future cash requirements for working capital  capital expenditures or the cash required to make interest and principal payments on the company s outstanding debt 
although ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  the company compensates for the limitations by only using ebitda to supplement gaap financial measures 
additionally  the company believes that investors should consider ebitda in conjunction with net income and the other required gaap measures of its performance and liquidity to improve their understanding of parkway s operating results and liquidity 
parkway views ebitda primarily as a liquidity measure and  as such  the gaap financial measure most directly comparable to it is cash flows provided by operating activities 
because ebitda is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap  it should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for operating income  net income  or cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities prepared in accordance with gaap

at march   fund ii had remaining investment capacity of million of which million represents parkway s remaining equity contribution that would be due in connection with additional investments in office properties 
critical accounting estimates general 
parkway s investments are generally made in office properties 
therefore  the company is generally subject to risks incidental to the ownership of real estate 
some of these risks include changes in supply or demand for office properties or customers for such properties in an area in which we have buildings  changes in real estate tax rates  and changes in federal income tax  real estate and zoning laws 
the company s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon its consolidated financial statements 
the company s consolidated financial statements include the accounts of parkway properties  inc  its majority owned subsidiaries and joint ventures in which the company has a controlling interest 
parkway also consolidates subsidiaries where the entity is a variable interest entity and parkway is the primary beneficiary 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the reporting period 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
the accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of the company s page of significant accounting policies are considered critical accounting policies due to the increased level of assumptions used or estimates made in determining their impact on our consolidated financial statements 
parkway considers critical accounting policies and estimates to be those used in the determination of the reported amounts and disclosure related to the following revenue recognition  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate  initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
revenue recognition 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the respective leases 
the cumulative difference between lease revenue recognized under this method and contractual lease payment terms is recorded as straight line rent receivable on the accompanying balance sheets 
when the company is the owner of the tenant improvements  the leased space is ready for its intended use when the tenant improvements are substantially completed 
in limited instances  when the customer is the owner of the tenant improvements  straight line rent is recognized when the tenant takes possession of the unimproved space 
the leases also typically provide for tenant reimbursement of a portion of common area maintenance and other operating expenses 
property operating cost recoveries from customers expense reimbursements are recognized as revenue in the period in which the expenses are incurred 
the computation of expense reimbursements is dependent on the provisions of individual customer leases 
most customers make monthly fixed payments of estimated expense reimbursements 
the company makes adjustments  positive or negative  to expense reimbursement income quarterly to adjust the recorded amounts to the company s best estimate of the final property operating costs based on the most recent quarterly budget 
after the end of the calendar year  the company computes each customer s final expense reimbursements and issues a bill or credit for the difference between the actual amount and the amounts billed monthly during the year 
management company income represents market based fees earned from providing management  construction  leasing  brokerage and acquisition services to third parties 
management fee income is computed and recorded monthly in accordance with the terms set forth in the stand alone management service agreements 
leasing and brokerage commissions are recognized pursuant to the terms of the stand alone agreements at the time underlying leases are signed  which is the point at which the earnings process is complete and collection of the fees is reasonably assured 
fees relating to the purchase or sale of property are recognized when the earnings process is complete and collection of the fees is reasonably assured  which usually occurs at closing 
all fees on company owned properties and consolidated joint ventures are eliminated in consolidation 
the portion of fees earned on unconsolidated joint ventures attributable to parkway ownership interest is eliminated in consolidation 
impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
changes in the supply or demand of tenants for our properties could impact our ability to fill available space 
should a significant amount of available space exist for an extended period  our investment in a particular office building may be impaired 
we evaluate our real estate assets upon the occurrence of significant adverse changes to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that affect the recovery of the carrying amount 
we classify certain assets as held for sale based on management having the authority and intent of entering into commitments for sale transactions to close in the next twelve months 
we consider an office property as held for sale once we have executed a contract for sale  allowed the buyer to complete its due diligence review and received a substantial non refundable deposit 
until a buyer has completed its due diligence review of the asset  necessary approvals have been received and substantive conditions to the buyer s obligation to perform have been satisfied  we do not consider a sale to be probable 
when the company identifies an asset as held for sale  we estimate the net realizable value of such asset and discontinue recording depreciation on the asset 
the company records assets held for sale at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
with respect to assets classified as held and used  we periodically review these assets to determine whether our carrying amount will be recovered 
a long lived asset is considered impaired if its carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds the sum of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
the cash flow and fair value estimates are based on assumptions about employing the asset for its remaining useful life 
factors considered in projecting future cash flows include but are not limited to existing leases  future leasing and terminations  market rental rates  capital improvements  tenant improvements  leasing commissions  inflation and other known variables 
upon impairment  page of the company would recognize an impairment loss to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to our estimate of its fair value 
the estimate of fair value and cash flows to be generated from properties requires us to make assumptions 
if one or more assumptions prove incorrect or if the assumptions change  the recognition of an impairment loss on one or more properties may be necessary in the future  which would result in a decrease to net income 
during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded non cash impairment losses of million related to non strategic office properties targeted for sale in columbia  south carolina and richmond  virginia 
the company began actively marketing these assets around year end 
as part of the marketing process  the company estimated that the fair value of these assets was less than their carrying value at december  therefore  an impairment loss for the assets was recorded during the fourth quarter of depreciable lives applied to real estate and improvements to real estate 
depreciation of buildings and parking garages is computed using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of years 
depreciation of building improvements is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
if our estimate of useful lives proves to be incorrect  the depreciation expense recognized would also be incorrect 
therefore  a change in the estimated useful lives assigned to buildings and improvements would result in either an increase or decrease in depreciation expense  which would result in an increase or decrease in earnings 
initial recognition  measurement and allocation of the cost of real estate acquired 
parkway accounts for its acquisitions of real estate by allocating the fair value of real estate to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building  garage  building improvements and tenant improvements  identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above and below market debt assumed with the acquisition 
parkway allocates the purchase price of properties to tangible and intangible assets based on fair values 
the company determines the fair value of the tangible and intangible components using a variety of methods and assumptions all of which result in an approximation of fair value 
differing assumptions and methods could result in different estimates of fair value and thus  a different purchase price allocation and corresponding increase or decrease in depreciation and amortization expense 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
our receivable balance is comprised primarily of rents and operating expense recoveries due from customers 
change in the supply of or demand for office properties could impact our customers ability to honor their lease obligations  which could in turn affect our recorded revenues and estimates of the collectability of our receivables 
revenue from real estate rentals is recognized and accrued as earned on a pro rata basis over the term of the lease 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts considering such factors as credit quality of our customers  delinquency of payment  historical trends and current economic conditions 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for customer balances that are over days past due and for specific customer receivables for which collection is considered doubtful 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could result in an increase or decrease in bad debt expense

funds from operations management believes that funds from operations attributable to common shareholders ffo is an appropriate measure of performance for equity reits and computes this measure in accordance with the nareit definition of ffo 
funds from operations is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property and extraordinary items under gaap  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments to derive the company s pro rata share of ffo of consolidated and unconsolidated joint ventures 
further  the company does not adjust ffo to eliminate the effects of non recurring charges 
the company believes that ffo is a meaningful supplemental measure of its operating performance because historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  as reflected through depreciation and amortization expenses 
however  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market and other conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance for real estate investment trusts that excludes historical cost depreciation and amortization  among other items  from net income  as defined by gaap 
the company believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required gaap presentations  has been beneficial in improving the understanding of operating results of real estate investment trusts among the investing public and making comparisons of operating results among such companies more meaningful 
ffo as page of reported by parkway may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition 
funds from operations do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and is not an indication of cash available to fund cash needs 
funds from operations should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow as a measure of liquidity 
the following table presents a reconciliation of the company net income to ffo for the years ended december  and in thousands year ended december net loss for parkway properties  inc adjustments to derive funds from operations depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization discontinued operations noncontrolling interest depreciation and amortization adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures preferred dividends gain on sale of real estate funds from operations attributable to common shareholders funds from operations attributable to common shareholders for the years ended december  and include the following items in thousands year ended december gain on involuntary conversion non cash impairment losses loss on extinguishment of debt acquisition costs expenses related to litigation lease termination fee income inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of the relatively low inflation rate in the company s geographic areas of operation 
additionally  most of the leases require the customers to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  utilities and insurance  thereby reducing the company s exposure to increases in operating expenses resulting from inflation 
the company s leases typically have three to seven year terms  which may enable the company to replace existing leases with new leases at market base rent  which may be higher or lower than the existing lease rate
