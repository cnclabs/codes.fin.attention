item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this financial review presents our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december   and our financial condition at december  except for the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements which are subject to known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
we discuss such risks  uncertainties and other factors throughout this report and specifically under item a of part i of this report  risk factors 
in addition  the following review should be read in connection with the information presented in our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions the preparation and presentation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  requires us to establish policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
in our judgment  the accounting policies  estimates and assumptions described below have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting assumptions and estimates are inherently uncertain and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to our customers 
a substantial portion of our revenue is generated by the sale of specialty pharmaceutical products primarily eye care pharmaceuticals  skin care and urologics products to wholesalers within the united states  and we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels at an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales 
a portion of our revenue is generated from consigned inventory of breast implants maintained at physician  hospital and clinic locations 
these customers are contractually obligated to maintain a specific level of inventory and to notify us upon the use of consigned inventory 
revenue for consigned inventory is recognized at the time we are notified by the customer that the product has been used 
notification is usually through the replenishing of the inventory  and we periodically review consignment inventories to confirm the accuracy of customer reporting 
we generally offer cash discounts to customers for the early payment of receivables 
those discounts are recorded as a reduction of revenue and accounts receivable in the same period that the related sale is recorded 
the amounts reserved for cash discounts were million and million at december  and  respectively 
provisions for cash discounts deducted from consolidated sales in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
we permit returns of product from most product lines by any class of customer if such product is returned in a timely manner  in good condition and from normal distribution channels 
return policies in certain international markets and for certain medical device products  primarily breast implants  provide for more stringent guidelines in accordance with the terms of contractual agreements with customers 
our estimates for sales returns are based upon the historical patterns of product returns matched against sales  and management s evaluation of specific factors that may increase the risk of product returns 
the amount of allowances for sales returns recognized in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and were million and million  respectively  and are recorded in other accrued expenses and trade receivables  net in our consolidated balance sheets 
see note  composition of certain financial statement captions in the notes to our consolidated financial statements listed under item of part iv of this report  exhibits and financial statement schedules 
provisions for sales returns deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in the amount of allowances for sales returns at december  compared to december  and the provisions for sales 
table of contents returns in compared to are primarily due to increased sales returns related to breast implant products  principally due to increased product sales volume  and the genericization in the united states of certain eye care pharmaceutical products 
the increase in the provisions for sales returns in compared to is primarily due to increased sales returns related to breast implant products  additional provisions for returns related to the genericization in the united states of certain eye care pharmaceutical products and a small increase in estimated product return rates for our other specialty pharmaceuticals products 
historical allowances for cash discounts and product returns have been consistent with the amounts reserved or accrued 
we participate in various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs  the largest of which relates to medicaid  medicare and the department of veterans affairs 
sales rebate and other incentive programs also include contractual volume rebate programs and chargebacks  which are contractual discounts given primarily to federal government agencies  health maintenance organizations  pharmacy benefits managers and group purchasing organizations 
we also offer rebate and other incentive programs for our aesthetic products and certain therapeutic products  including botox cosmetic  juv derm  latisse  acuvail  aczone and restasis  and for certain other skin care products 
sales rebates and incentive accruals reduce revenue in the same period that the related sale is recorded and are included in other accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
the amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs were million and million at december  and  respectively 
provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs deducted from consolidated sales were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in the amounts accrued at december  compared to december  and the provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs in compared to are primarily due to an increase in activity under previously established rebate and incentive programs  principally related to our eye care pharmaceuticals  botox cosmetic  skin care and facial aesthetics products  an increase in the number of incentive programs offered  additional contractual discounts to federal government agencies related to the recently enacted health care reform legislation  and increased overall product sales volume 
the increase in the provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs in compared to is primarily due to an increase in the number of incentive programs offered and an increase in activity under previously established incentive programs  principally related to our eye care pharmaceuticals  botox cosmetic  skin care and facial aesthetics products 
in addition  an increase in our published list prices in the united states for pharmaceutical products  which occurred for several of our products in each of and  generally results in higher provisions for sales rebates and other incentive programs deducted from consolidated sales 
our procedures for estimating amounts accrued for sales rebates and other incentive programs at the end of any period are based on available quantitative data and are supplemented by management s judgment with respect to many factors  including but not limited to  current market dynamics  changes in contract terms  changes in sales trends  an evaluation of current laws and regulations and product pricing 
quantitatively  we use historical sales  product utilization and rebate data and apply forecasting techniques in order to estimate our liability amounts 
qualitatively  management s judgment is applied to these items to modify  if appropriate  the estimated liability amounts 
there are inherent risks in this process 
for example  customers may not achieve assumed utilization levels  customers may misreport their utilization to us  and actual movements of the us consumer price index for all urban consumers  or cpi u  which affect our rebate programs with us federal and state government agencies  may differ from those estimated 
on a quarterly basis  adjustments to our estimated liabilities for sales rebates and other incentive programs related to sales made in prior periods have not been material and have generally been less than of consolidated product net sales 
an adjustment to our estimated liabilities of of consolidated product net sales on a quarterly basis would result in an increase or decrease to net sales and earnings before income taxes of approximately million to million 
the sensitivity of our estimates can vary by program and type of customer 
additionally  there is a significant time lag between the date we determine the estimated liability and when we actually pay the liability 
due to this time lag  we record adjustments to our estimated liabilities over several periods  which can result in a net increase to earnings or a net decrease to earnings in those periods 
material differences may result in the amount of revenue we recognize from product sales if the actual amount of rebates and incentives differ materially from the amounts estimated by management 

table of contents we recognize license fees  royalties and reimbursement income for services provided as other revenues based on the facts and circumstances of each contractual agreement 
in general  we recognize income upon the signing of a contractual agreement that grants rights to products or technology to a third party if we have no further obligation to provide products or services to the third party after entering into the contract 
we defer income under contractual agreements when we have further obligations that indicate that a separate earnings process has not been completed 
pensions we sponsor various pension plans in the united states and abroad in accordance with local laws and regulations 
our us pension plans account for a large majority of our aggregate pension plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations 
in connection with these plans  we use certain actuarial assumptions to determine the plans net periodic benefit costs and projected benefit obligations  the most significant of which are the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discount rate 
our assumption for the weighted average expected long term rate of return on assets in our us funded pension plan for determining the net periodic benefit cost is for  which is the same rate used for and our assumptions for the weighted average expected long term rate of return on assets in our non us funded pension plans are  and for  and  respectively 
for our us funded pension plan  we determine  based upon recommendations from our pension plan s investment advisors  the expected rate of return using a building block approach that considers diversification and rebalancing for a long term portfolio of invested assets 
our investment advisors study historical market returns and preserve long term historical relationships between equities and fixed income in a manner consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility generate a greater return over the long run 
they also evaluate market factors such as inflation and interest rates before long term capital market assumptions are determined 
for our non us funded pension plans  the expected rate of return was determined based on asset distribution and assumed long term rates of return on fixed income instruments and equities 
market conditions and other factors can vary over time and could significantly affect our estimates of the weighted average expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected rate of return is applied to the market related value of plan assets 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in our rate of return on assets assumptions for our us and us funded pension plans would increase our expected pre tax pension benefit cost by approximately million 
the weighted average discount rates used to calculate our us and non us pension benefit obligations at december  were and  respectively  and at december  were and  respectively 
the weighted average discount rates used to calculate our us and us net periodic benefit costs for were and  respectively  for  and  respectively  and for  and  respectively 
we determine the discount rate based upon a hypothetical portfolio of high quality fixed income investments with maturities that mirror the pension benefit obligations at the plans measurement date 
market conditions and other factors can vary over time and could significantly affect our estimates for the discount rates used to calculate our pension benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for future years 
as a sensitivity measure  the effect of a decline in the discount rate assumption for our us and us pension plans would increase our expected pre tax pension benefit costs by approximately million and increase our pension plans projected benefit obligations at december  by approximately million 
share based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based awards made to employees and directors 
the fair value of share based awards is estimated at the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model and the portion that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as compensation cost over the requisite service period using the straight line single option method 
the fair value of modifications to share based awards is generally estimated using a lattice model 

table of contents the determination of fair value using the black scholes and lattice option pricing models is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
we currently estimate stock price volatility based upon an equal weighting of the historical average over the expected life of the award and the average implied volatility of at the money options traded in the open market 
we estimate employee stock option exercise behavior based on actual historical exercise activity and assumptions regarding future exercise activity of unexercised  outstanding options 
share based compensation expense is recognized only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest  and we have applied an estimated forfeiture rate to unvested awards for the purpose of calculating compensation cost 
these estimates will be revised in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates 
changes in forfeiture estimates impact compensation cost in the period in which the change in estimate occurs 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is determined using an estimated annual effective tax rate  which is generally less than the us federal statutory rate  primarily because of lower tax rates in certain non us jurisdictions  research and development  or r d  tax credits available in the united states  california and other foreign jurisdictions and deductions available in the united states for domestic production activities 
our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the year as new information is obtained  which may affect the assumptions used to estimate the annual effective tax rate  including factors such as the mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  the recognition or derecognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions  expected utilization of r d tax credits and changes in or the interpretation of tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct business 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities along with net operating loss and tax credit carryovers 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
when we establish or reduce the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our provision for income taxes will increase or decrease  respectively  in the period such determination is made 
valuation allowances against deferred tax assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
changes in the valuation allowances  when they are recognized in the provision for income taxes  are included as a component of the estimated annual effective tax rate 
we have not provided for withholding and us taxes for the unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have currently reinvested these earnings indefinitely in these foreign operations 
at december   we had approximately  million in unremitted earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
income tax expense would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 
it is not practicable to estimate the amount of the deferred tax liability on such unremitted earnings 
upon remittance  certain foreign countries impose withholding taxes that are then available  subject to certain limitations  for use as credits against our us tax liability  if any 
we annually update our estimate of unremitted earnings outside the united states after the completion of each fiscal year 
we recorded a tax benefit of million in the fourth quarter of in connection with the total fiscal year pre tax charges of million related to the global settlement with the us department of justice  or doj 
acquisitions the accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of estimates and judgments to measure the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development  and 
table of contents liabilities assumed 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired can only be recognized as goodwill in a business combination 
on july   we completed a business combination agreement and effected a revised distribution agreement with our distributor in turkey 
we paid million for the termination of the original distribution agreement and purchased the commercial assets related to the selling of our products in turkey for million in cash and estimated contingent consideration of million as of the acquisition date 
on january   we acquired serica technologies  inc  or serica  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  net of cash acquired 
on july   we acquired a stockholder interest in a joint venture  samil allergan ophthalmic joint venture company  or samil  for approximately million  net of cash acquired 
we accounted for these acquisitions as business combinations 
the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with these acquisitions were recognized based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition dates 
the determination of estimated fair values requires significant estimates and assumptions including  but not limited to  determining the timing and estimated costs to complete the in process projects  projecting regulatory approvals  estimating future cash flows and developing appropriate discount rates 
we believe the estimated fair values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on reasonable assumptions 
impairment evaluations for goodwill and purchased intangible assets we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist  by comparing the carrying value of each of our reporting units to their estimated fair value 
we have identified two reporting units  specialty pharmaceuticals and medical devices  and currently perform our annual evaluation as of october each year 
we primarily use the income approach and the market approach to valuation that include the discounted cash flow method  the guideline company method  as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
upon completion of the october annual impairment assessment  we determined that no impairment was indicated as the estimated fair value of each of the two reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value 
as of december   we do not believe any significant indicators of impairment exist for our goodwill that would require additional analysis 
we also review purchased intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our intangible assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment in the carrying value of an intangible asset is recognized whenever anticipated future undiscounted cash flows from an intangible asset are estimated to be less than its carrying value 
in the third quarter of  we concluded that the intangible assets and a related prepaid royalty asset associated with the sanctura franchise  or the sanctura assets  which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of esprit pharma holding company  inc  or esprit  and certain subsequent licensing and commercialization transactions  had become impaired 
we determined that an impairment charge was required with respect to the sanctura assets because the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over their remaining useful life were not sufficient to recover the current carrying amount of the sanctura assets and the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of those assets due to a reduction in expected future financial performance for the sanctura franchise resulting from lower than anticipated acceptance by patients  physicians and payors 
as a result  in the third quarter of  we recorded an aggregate charge of million related to the impairment of the sanctura assets and related costs  which includes a charge of million for the impairment of the sanctura intangible assets 
we did not record any impairment charges in in  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million for an intangible asset related to the phase out of a collagen product 

table of contents significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in our impairment evaluations 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans may change and estimates used may prove to be inaccurate 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur future impairment charges 
operations headquartered in irvine  california  we are a multi specialty health care company focused on discovering  developing and commercializing innovative pharmaceuticals  biologics  medical devices and over the counter products that enable people to live life to its greatest potential to see more clearly  move more freely and express themselves more fully 
our diversified approach enables us to follow our research and development into new specialty areas where unmet needs are significant 
we discover  develop and commercialize specialty pharmaceutical  biologics  medical devices and over the counter products for the ophthalmic  neurological  medical aesthetics  medical dermatology  breast aesthetics  obesity intervention  urological and other specialty markets in more than countries around the world 
we are a pioneer in specialty pharmaceutical research  targeting products and technologies related to specific disease areas such as chronic dry eye  glaucoma  retinal disease  psoriasis  acne  movement disorders  neuropathic pain and genitourinary diseases 
additionally  we are a leader in discovering  developing and marketing therapeutic and aesthetic biological  pharmaceutical and medical device products  including saline and silicone gel breast implants  dermal fillers and obesity intervention products 
at december   we employed approximately  persons around the world 
our principal markets are the united states  europe  latin america and asia pacific 
results of operations we operate our business on the basis of two reportable segments specialty pharmaceuticals and medical devices 
the specialty pharmaceuticals segment produces a broad range of pharmaceutical products  including ophthalmic products for dry eye  glaucoma  retinal diseases and ocular surface disease  botox for certain therapeutic and aesthetic indications  skin care products for acne  psoriasis  eyelash growth and other prescription and over the counter skin care products  and urologics products 
the medical devices segment produces a broad range of medical devices  including breast implants for augmentation  revision and reconstructive surgery  obesity intervention products  including the lap band system and the orbera intragastric balloon system  and facial aesthetics products 
we provide global marketing strategy teams to coordinate the development and execution of a consistent marketing strategy for our products in all geographic regions that share similar distribution channels and customers 
management evaluates our business segments and various global product portfolios on a revenue basis  which is presented below in accordance with gaap 
we also report sales performance using the non gaap financial measure of constant currency sales 
constant currency sales represent current period reported sales  adjusted for the translation effect of changes in average foreign exchange rates between the current period and the corresponding period in the prior year 
we calculate the currency effect by comparing adjusted current period reported sales  calculated using the monthly average foreign exchange rates for the corresponding period in the prior year  to the actual current period reported sales 
we routinely evaluate our net sales performance at constant currency so that sales results can be viewed without the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates  thereby facilitating period to period comparisons of our sales 
generally  when the us dollar either strengthens or weakens against other currencies  the growth at constant currency rates will be higher or lower  respectively  than growth reported at actual exchange rates

product net sales product net sales increased by million in compared to due to an increase of million in our specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales and an increase of million in our medical devices product net sales 
the increase in specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales is due to increases in product net sales of our eye care pharmaceuticals  botox  and skin care product lines  partially offset by a small decrease in product net sales of our urologics product line 
the increase in medical devices product net sales reflects an increase in product net sales of our breast aesthetics and facial aesthetics product lines  partially offset by a decrease in product net sales of our obesity intervention product line 
several of our products  including botox cosmetic  latisse and our facial aesthetics  obesity intervention and breast implant products  are purchased based on consumer choice and have limited reimbursement or are not reimbursable by government or other health care plans and are  therefore  partially or wholly paid for directly by the consumer 
as such  the general economic environment and level of consumer spending have a significant effect on our sales of these products 
in march  the us government enacted the patient protection and affordable care act  as amended by the health care and education affordability reconciliation act  collectively  the ppaca  reforming the us health care system 
the ppaca includes provisions that we believe will have a significant negative impact on our product net sales  including an extension of medicaid and medicare benefits to new patient populations  an increase in medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the medicaid drug rebate program  a future increase in the initial coverage limit for medicare participants  future annual non deductible fees on entities that manufacture or import branded prescription drugs offered for 
table of contents sale in the united states  and future excise taxes on the sales of medical devices in the united states 
in  we recognized a reduction in product net sales of approximately million for additional rebates related to the ppaca 
based on internal information and assumptions  we currently estimate that the ppaca will have a negative impact on our fiscal year product net sales and operating expenses  resulting in a negative impact on our earnings on a pre tax equivalent basis of approximately million 
in addition  we expect incremental price reductions and rebate increases mandated by european governments to also have a negative impact on our pre tax earnings of approximately million 
in the aggregate  the incremental costs of the ppaca and european pricing pressures will have a negative impact on our fiscal year earnings on a pre tax equivalent basis of approximately million 
eye care pharmaceuticals product net sales increased in compared to primarily due to an increase in net sales of restasis  our therapeutic treatment for chronic dry eye disease  an increase in sales of our glaucoma drug lumigan  an increase in sales of ganfort  our lumigan and timolol combination for the treatment of glaucoma  an increase in new product sales of lumigan  which was launched in the united states in the fourth quarter of  an increase in sales of combigan  our alphagan and timolol combination for the treatment of glaucoma  an increase in sales of alphagan p  an increase in sales of ozurdex  our biodegradable  sustained release steroid implant for the treatment of certain retinal diseases  an increase in new product sales of zymaxid  our next generation anti infective product in the fluoroquinolone category indicated for the treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis  which was launched in the second quarter of  an increase in sales of acuvail  our next generation preservative free  non steroidal anti inflammatory  which was launched in the third quarter of  and an increase in sales of our artificial tears products refresh and refresh optive  partially offset by a decrease in sales of our glaucoma drugs alphagan and alphagan p  our older generation fluoroquinolone zymar and our non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs acular and acular ls 
aggregate product net sales for alphagan  alphagan p  acular  and acular ls decreased approximately million in compared to  primarily due to generic competition in the united states 
however  total product net sales for our alphagan franchise  which includes alphagan  alphagan p  alphagan p and combigan  and our products containing ketorolac  which include acular  acular ls and acuvail  decreased approximately million in the aggregate in compared to while we estimate that our product net sales will continue to be negatively impacted due to sales of generic formulations of alphagan  alphagan p  acular  and acular ls  we expect that any such negative impact on product net sales will be partially offset by increased sales of alphagan p  combigan and acuvail 
in addition  we expect generic versions of zymar and elestat to be launched in the united states in early while we estimate that our product net sales will be negatively impacted in due to sales of generic formulations of these products  we expect that any such negative impact on product net sales will be partially offset by increased sales of zymaxid and lastacaft  our topical allergy medication for the treatment and prevention of itching associated with allergic conjunctivitis  which we launched in january we do not believe that our liquidity will be materially impacted in by generic competition 
we increased prices on certain eye care pharmaceutical products in the united states in effective january   we increased the published us list price for combigan  alphagan p and zymar by five percent  restasis by four percent  elestat by ten percent and acular and acular ls by three percent 
effective april   we increased the published us list price of lumigan by six percent 
effective july   we increased the published us list price of alphagan p by eight percent and acular  acular ls  and acuvail by three percent 
effective october   we increased the published us list price of restasis by an additional five percent  alphagan p by an additional four percent  and combigan by an additional six percent 
these price increases had a positive net effect on our us sales in compared to  but the actual net effect is difficult to determine due to the various managed care sales rebate and other incentive programs in which we participate 
wholesaler buying patterns and the change in dollar value of the prescription product mix also affected our reported net sales dollars  although we are unable to determine the impact of these effects 

table of contents total sales of botox increased in compared to due to an increase in sales of botox for both cosmetic and therapeutic use in all of our principal geographic markets 
we believe sales of botox  primarily botox cosmetic  were negatively impacted in by the introduction of a competitive product that was launched in the united states in june based on internal information and assumptions  we estimate in that botox therapeutic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox sales and grew at a rate of approximately compared to in  botox cosmetic sales accounted for approximately of total consolidated botox sales and increased by approximately compared to we believe our worldwide market share for neuromodulators  including botox  was approximately in the third quarter of  the last quarter for which market data is available 
skin care product net sales increased in compared to primarily due to an increase in sales of latisse  our treatment for inadequate or insufficient eyelashes  an increase in sales of aczone  our topical dapsone treatment for acne vulgaris  and a small increase in total sales of tazorac  zorac and avage  our topical tazarotene products 
effective january   we increased the published us list price for aczone by approximately ten to sixteen percent  depending on package size  and tazorac and avage by approximately ten percent 
effective june   we increased the published us list prices of aczone by approximately an additional six percent and tazorac and avage by approximately an additional ten percent 
effective october   we increased the published us list prices of tazorac and avage by approximately an additional ten percent 
we expect a generic version of our tazorac cream product to be launched in the united states in mid and estimate that our product net sales will be negatively impacted in due to sales of generic formulations of this product 
urologics sales  which are presently concentrated in the united states and consist of our sanctura franchise products for the treatment of overactive bladder  decreased in compared to  primarily due to lower sales of sanctura  our twice a day anticholinergic for the treatment of overactive bladder  or oab  which was negatively impacted by the launch of trospium chloride generics at the beginning of september  partially offset by a small increase in sales of sanctura xr  our second generation  once daily anticholinergic for the treatment of oab 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a co promotion agreement with quintiles transnational corp  or quintiles  under which quintiles began to promote sanctura xr to general practitioners in the united states 
in the third quarter of  we terminated the co promotion agreement with quintiles due to lower than anticipated sales of sanctura xr in the general practitioner market 
we continue to focus our internal sales efforts on sanctura xr in the urology specialty market 
effective january   we increased the published us list price for sanctura by approximately nine percent 
effective february   we increased the published us list price for sanctura xr by six percent 
effective july   we increased the published us list price of sanctura xr by an additional three percent and sanctura by an additional ten percent 
we have a policy to attempt to maintain average us wholesaler inventory levels of our specialty pharmaceutical products at an amount less than eight weeks of our net sales 
at december   based on available external and internal information  we believe the amount of average us wholesaler inventories of our specialty pharmaceutical products was near the lower end of our stated policy levels 
breast aesthetics product net sales  which consist primarily of sales of silicone gel and saline breast implants and tissue expanders  increased in compared to due to increases in sales in all of our principal geographic markets 
the increase in sales of breast aesthetics products in the united states was primarily due to higher unit volume and the continued transition of the us market to higher priced silicone gel products from lower priced saline products 
the overall increase in sales of breast aesthetics products in our international markets was primarily due to higher unit volume 
obesity intervention product net sales  which consist primarily of sales of devices used for minimally invasive long term treatments of obesity such as our lap band and lap band ap systems and orbera 
table of contents system  decreased in compared to primarily due to a decrease in sales in the united states  partially offset by increases in sales in most markets in europe  latin america and canada 
we believe sales of obesity intervention products in the united states and other principal geographic markets continued to be negatively impacted in by general economic conditions given the substantial patient co pays associated with these products and government spending restrictions 
facial aesthetics product net sales  which consist primarily of sales of hyaluronic acid based and collagen based dermal fillers used to correct facial wrinkles  increased in compared to primarily due to significant increases in sales in the united states  canada and all of our other principal geographic markets 
we believe the increase in sales of facial aesthetic products was primarily due to the february launch of juv derm xc with lidocaine in the united states and recent launches of juv derm with lidocaine and juv derm voluma in other international markets  an expansion of the facial aesthetics market and an increase in our share of the hyaluronic acid based dermal filler market  partially offset by a decline in sales of older generation collagen based dermal fillers 
we currently expect to discontinue selling collagen based dermal fillers during foreign currency changes increased product net sales by million in compared to  primarily due to the strengthening of the canadian dollar  brazilian real and australian dollar compared to the us dollar  partially offset by the weakening of the euro compared to the us dollar 
us product net sales as a percentage of total product net sales decreased by percentage points to in compared to us sales of in  due primarily to higher sales growth in our international markets compared to the us market for our eye care pharmaceuticals  botox and obesity intervention product lines  partially offset by an increase in sales of our skin care products  which are highly concentrated in the united states 
additionally  international sales benefited from a positive translation impact due to a general strengthening of foreign currencies compared to the us dollar in markets where we sold products in compared to product net sales increased by million in compared to due to an increase of million in our specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales  partially offset by a decrease of million in our medical devices product net sales 
the increase in specialty pharmaceuticals product net sales is due to sales increases in our eye care pharmaceutical and skin care product lines  partially offset by small decreases in our botox and urologics product lines 
the decrease in medical devices product net sales reflects a decrease in product net sales across all of our medical device product lines 
net sales were negatively affected by a general weakening of foreign currencies compared to the us dollar in the foreign countries where we operated during compared to eye care pharmaceuticals product net sales increased in compared to primarily due to strong growth in sales of restasis  our therapeutic treatment for chronic dry eye disease  an increase in sales of combigan  our alphagan and timolol combination for the treatment of glaucoma  an increase in sales of ganfort  our lumigan and timolol combination for the treatment of glaucoma  an increase in sales of alphagan p  our most recent generation of alphagan for the treatment of glaucoma and an increase in new product sales of acuvail  our next generation preservative free  non steroidal anti inflammatory  which we launched in the united states in the third quarter of  partially offset by lower sales of our glaucoma drugs alphagan and alphagan p  lower sales of our non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs acular and acular ls and a small decline in sales in dollars of artificial tears products 
generic formulations of alphagan  alphagan p  acular and acular ls had a negative effect on our sales of these products in we estimate the majority of the increase in our eye care pharmaceuticals sales was due to an overall net increase in the volume of product sold and a shift in sales mix to a greater percentage of higher priced products  partially offset by the negative impact on our international product net sales from a general weakening of foreign currencies compared to the us dollar 

table of contents during  we increased the published list prices for certain eye care pharmaceutical products in the united states

a significant amount of our existing cash and equivalents are held by non us subsidiaries 
we currently plan to use these funds in our operations outside the united states 
withholding and us taxes have not been provided for unremitted earnings of certain non us subsidiaries because we have reinvested these earnings indefinitely in such operations 
at december   we had approximately  million in unremitted 
table of contents earnings outside the united states for which withholding and us taxes were not provided 
tax costs would be incurred if these funds were remitted to the united states 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with borrowings available under our existing credit facilities and existing cash and equivalents and short term investments  will provide us with sufficient resources to meet our current expected obligations  working capital requirements  debt service  including the potential redemption or conversion of our convertible notes  and other cash needs over the next year 
inflation although at reduced levels in recent years and at the end of  inflation continues to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services that we use 
the competitive and regulatory environments in many markets substantially limit our ability to fully recover these higher costs through increased selling prices 
we continually seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation through cost containment and improved productivity and manufacturing processes 
foreign currency fluctuations approximately of our product net sales in were derived from operations outside the united states  and a portion of our international cost structure is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in sales and earnings reported in us dollars due to changing currency exchange rates 
we routinely monitor our transaction exposure to currency rates and implement certain economic hedging strategies to limit such exposure  as we deem appropriate 
the net impact of foreign currency fluctuations on our sales was an increase of million in  a decrease of million in and an increase of million in  respectively 
the sales increase included million related to the brazilian real  million related to the canadian dollar  million related to the australian dollar  million related to the mexican peso and million related to other asian and latin american currencies  partially offset by decreases of million related to the euro and million related to the uk pound

in determining the minimum required funding  we utilize current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future 
in management s judgment  minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated 
where minimum funding as determined for each individual plan would not achieve a funded status to the level of local statutory requirements  additional discretionary funding may be provided from available cash resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our operations are exposed to risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we address these risks through controlled risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments to economically hedge or reduce these exposures 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
see note  financial instruments  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements listed under item of part iv of this report  exhibits and financial statement schedules  for activities relating to interest rate and foreign currency risk management 
to ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of our interest rate and foreign exchange hedge positions  we continually monitor our interest rate swap positions and foreign exchange forward and option positions both on a stand alone basis and in conjunction with our underlying interest rate and foreign currency exposures  from an accounting and economic perspective 
however  given the inherent limitations of forecasting and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to be hedged  we cannot assure you that such programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either interest or foreign exchange rates 
in addition  the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark to market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and  therefore  may adversely affect our consolidated operating results and financial position 

table of contents interest rate risk our interest income and expense are more sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of us interest rates than to changes in rates in other markets 
changes in us interest rates affect the interest earned on our cash and equivalents and short term investments and interest expense on our debt  as well as costs associated with foreign currency contracts 
on january   we entered into a nine year  two month interest rate swap with a million notional amount with semi annual settlements and quarterly interest rate reset dates 
the swap receives interest at a fixed rate of and pays interest at a variable interest rate equal to month libor plus  and effectively converts million of the million aggregate principal amount of our notes to a variable interest rate 
based on the structure of the hedging relationship  the hedge meets the criteria for using the short cut method for a fair value hedge 
the investment in the derivative and the related long term debt are recorded at fair value 
at december  and  we recognized in our consolidated balance sheets an asset reported in investments and other assets and a corresponding increase in long term debt associated with the fair value of the derivative of million and million  respectively 
the differential to be paid or received as interest rates change is accrued and recognized as an adjustment of interest expense related to the notes 
during  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  as a reduction of interest expense due to the differential to be received 
in february  we entered into interest rate swap contracts based on month libor with an aggregate notional amount of million  a swap period of years and a starting swap rate of 
we entered into these swap contracts as a cash flow hedge to effectively fix the future interest rate for our notes 
in april  we terminated the interest rate swap contracts and received approximately million 
the total gain is being amortized as a reduction to interest expense over a year period to match the term of the notes 
as of december   the remaining unrecognized gain  net of tax  of million is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease by for the year  annual interest expense  including the effect of the million notional amount of the interest rate swap entered into on january   would increase or decrease by approximately million 
commercial paper  when outstanding  is issued at current short term interest rates 
additionally  any future borrowings that are outstanding under the long term credit facility will be subject to a floating interest rate 
therefore  higher interest costs could occur if interest rates increase in the future

table of contents foreign currency risk overall  we are a net recipient of currencies other than the us dollar and  as such  benefit from a weaker dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a strengthening of the us dollar  may negatively affect our consolidated revenues or operating costs and expenses as expressed in us dollars 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts to reduce earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes to allow our management to focus its attention on our core business issues 
accordingly  we enter into various contracts which change in value as foreign exchange rates change to economically offset the effect of changes in the value of foreign currency assets and liabilities  commitments and anticipated foreign currency denominated sales and operating expenses 
we enter into foreign currency option and forward contracts in amounts between minimum and maximum anticipated foreign exchange exposures  generally for periods not to exceed months 
we use foreign currency option contracts  which provide for the sale or purchase of foreign currencies to offset foreign currency exposures expected to arise in the normal course of our business 
while these instruments are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are anticipated to offset changes in the value of the underlying exposures 
all of our outstanding foreign currency option contracts are entered into to reduce the volatility of earnings generated in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily earnings denominated in the canadian dollar  mexican peso  australian dollar  brazilian real  euro  korean won and turkish lira
