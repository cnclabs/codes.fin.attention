we conduct a significant portion of our operations in foreign countries 
approximately and of our consolidated service revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  were from non us operations 
because our financial statements are denominated in us dollars  changes in foreign currency exchange rates can have a significant effect on our operating results 
for the fiscal year  approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in euros and approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in pounds sterling 
for the fiscal year  approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in euros and approximately of total consolidated service revenue was denominated in pounds sterling 
approximately of our contracts are fixed price  with some variable components  and range in duration from a few months to several years 
cash flows from these contracts typically consist of a down payment required to be paid at the time of contract execution with the balance due in installments over the contract s duration  usually on a milestone achievement basis 
revenue from these contracts is recognized generally as work is performed 
as a result  the timing of cash receipts do not necessarily correspond to costs incurred and revenue recognized on contracts 
generally  our clients can either terminate their contracts with us upon thirty to sixty days notice or delay execution of services 
clients may terminate or delay contracts for a variety of reasons  including merger or potential merger related activities involving the client  the failure of products being tested to satisfy safety requirements or efficacy criteria  unexpected or undesired clinical results of the product  client cost reductions as a result of budgetary limits or changing priorities  the client s decision to forego a particular study  insufficient patient enrollment or investigator recruitment  or clinical drug manufacturing problems resulting in shortages of the product 

table of contents acquisitions acquisitions are an important component of our business strategy 
we account for acquisitions in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  business combinations 
since june   we have completed the following acquisition clinphone in august  we completed the acquisition of clinphone  one of the world s leading clinical technology organizations  for approximately million  comprised of million for the stock of clinphone and million as repayment of clinphone s existing debt 
we believe that the acquisition of clinphone has advanced our position as a clinical technology leader 
biopharmaceutical companies have increasingly requested technology solutions and expertise to support the full range of clinical development activities while improving the speed and efficiency of clinical programs 
we believe that the broad technological offering that we now provide gives clients a more comprehensive and robust suite of clinical information technologies 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate if the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment involved  or the susceptibility of such matter to change  and if the impact of the estimate or assumption on financial condition or operating performance is material 
we believe that the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results revenue recognition we derive revenue from the delivery of service or software solutions to clients in the worldwide pharmaceutical  biotechnology  and medical device industries 
in general  we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the service offering has been delivered to the client  the collection of fees is probable  and the amount of fees to be paid by the client is fixed or determinable 
our client arrangements generally involve multiple service deliverables  where bundled service deliverables are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  multiple element arrangements and accounting standards update asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
we determined that each of our service deliverables has standalone value and base the selling price upon third party evidence tpe 
tpe is established for each of our arrangement deliverables based on the price we charge for equivalent services when sold to other similar customers as well as our knowledge of market pricing from the competitive bidding process for customer contracts offering similar services to comparably situated customers 
within perceptive s clinphone rtsm business  we offer selected software solutions through a hosted application delivered through a standard web browser 
we recognize revenue from application hosting services in accordance with asc  revenue recognition in the software industry and asc as our customers do not have the right to take possession of the software 
revenue resulting from these hosting services consists of three stages set up client specification and workflow  hosting and support services  and closeout reporting 

table of contents critical management estimates may be involved in the determination of hosting period  and other revenue elements 
changes to these elements could affect the amount and timing of revenue recognition 
billed and unbilled accounts receivable billed accounts receivable represent amounts for which invoices have been sent to clients 
unbilled accounts receivable represent amounts recognized as revenue for which invoices have not yet been sent to clients 
we maintain a provision for losses on receivables based on historical collectability and specific identification of potential problem accounts 
critical management estimates may be involved in the determination of collectability and the amounts required to be recorded as provisions for losses on receivables 
income taxes our global provision for corporate income taxes is determined in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance is established if it is more likely than not that future tax benefits from the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
income tax expense is based on the distribution of profit before tax among the various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate  adjusted as required by the tax laws of each taxing jurisdiction 
changes in the distribution of profits and losses among taxing jurisdictions may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of asc  which requires financial statement reporting of the expected future tax consequences of uncertain tax return reporting positions on the presumption that all relevant tax authorities possess full knowledge of those tax reporting positions  as well as all of the pertinent facts and circumstances 
in addition  asc requires financial statement disclosure about uncertainty in income tax reporting positions 
we are subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities that may result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is based on judgment 
we believe we have adequately provided for any uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the related net assets at the date of acquisition 
under asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles such as tradenames is subject to annual impairment testing or more frequent testing if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the carrying value below its fair value 
the impairment testing for goodwill involves determining the fair value of each of the reporting units with which the goodwill was associated and comparing that value with the reporting unit s carrying value 
we conducted an impairment assessment in fiscal year using a market approach analysis and a discounted cash flow analysis at the reporting unit level to determine fair value 
the discounted cash flow analysis included significant judgment regarding the assumptions used  such as our weighted average cost of capital  revenue growth rates  profit margins  capital expenditures  and other factors that were all based on current strategic forecasts and other financial metrics 
as of june   there were no required adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill since the fair value of our net assets were substantially above the carrying value of our net assets at each of our reporting units 
variations over time in the measures and estimates used in the discounted cash flow analysis could result in future impairment of goodwill that could have a material impact to our financial position or our results of operations 

table of contents results of operations note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k provides a summary of our unaudited quarterly results of operations for the years ended june  and analysis by segment we evaluate our segment performance and allocate resources based on service revenue and gross profit service revenue less direct costs  while other operating costs are allocated and evaluated on a geographic basis 
accordingly  we do not include the impact of selling  general  and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization expense  interest income expense  other income loss  and income tax expense benefit in segment profitability 
we attribute revenue to individual countries based upon the number of hours of services performed in the respective countries and inter segment transactions are not included in service revenue

the increases were due primarily to strong new business growth in crs  especially in the asia pacific region 
growth in the americas was also due to a change in internal contractual arrangements that determine how much revenue from a client contract is attributed to respective parexel legal entities 
in the past  we recognized revenue in respective regions based upon the work performed therein 
furthermore  service revenue in europe  middle east africa was positively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations of approximately million 
the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations in asia pacific was approximately million 
on a segment basis  crs service revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was attributable to a million improvement in our phase ii iii pace business and million related to the positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations  partly offset by a million decrease in early phase 
the growth is a result of successful sales efforts over the past year and the continued positive impact of strategic partnerships 
however  it has taken longer to recognize revenue from backlog related to strategic partnerships than from backlog related to traditional client contracts 
pcms service revenue increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for the same period in the increase was due primarily to a million increase in strategic compliance related services due to increased regulatory activities that our clients have encountered

income from operations income from operations decreased to million for fiscal year from million for the same period in due the factors described above 
income from operations as a percentage of service revenue  or operating margin  decreased to from for the respective periods 
this decrease in operating margin was due primarily to increases in direct costs described above 
other expense  net we recorded net other expense of million for fiscal year compared with million for fiscal year the million increase was due to a million increase in interest expense  including million of accelerated financing fees from the refinancing of our debt  and a million increase in miscellaneous expense 
miscellaneous expense for fiscal year of million was primarily attributable to million of losses on certain foreign denominated assets and liabilities and the million charge for the impairment of certain long lived assets in france  partly offset by million of unrealized gains related to derivatives contracts 
the higher than anticipated net loss was caused  in part  by short term disruptions associated with the implementation of our new project accounting and billing system which adversely impacted cash flow and delayed the settlement of certain intercompany transactions 
miscellaneous expense for fiscal year of million included million of losses related to derivatives contracts  a million reserve for an impaired investment in a french laboratory that filed for bankruptcy protection  and a million asset impairment charge  partly offset by million in gains on the revaluation of foreign denominated assets liabilities 
taxes for fiscal year and  we had an effective income tax rate of and  respectively 
the decrease in tax rate is primarily attributable to the favorable impact of a change in the geographic distribution of earnings  a reduction in non deductible expenses outside of the united states  and a reduction in valuation reserves in the united kingdom and united states 
we do not expect that the low rate in fiscal year will carry into fiscal year

investing activities primarily reflect the costs of acquisitions and capital expenditures for information systems enhancements and leasehold improvements 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
our cash is held in deposit accounts and money market funds  which provide us with immediate and unlimited access to funds 
repatriation of funds to the us from us entities may be subject to taxation or certain legal restrictions 
nevertheless  most of our cash resides in countries with little or no such restrictions 
days sales outstanding our operating cash flow is heavily influenced by changes in the levels of billed and unbilled receivables and deferred revenue 
these account balances as well as days sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable  net of deferred revenue  can vary based on contractual milestones and the timing and size of cash receipts 
we calculate dso by adding the end of period balances for billed and unbilled account receivables  net of deferred revenue short term and long term and the provision for losses on receivables  then dividing the resulting amount by the sum of total revenue plus investigator fees billed for the most recent quarter  and multiplying the resulting fraction by the number of days in the quarter

we have a cash pooling arrangement with rbs nederland  nv 
pooling occurs when debit balances are offset against credit balances and the overall net position is used as a basis by the bank for calculating the overall pool interest amount 
each legal entity owned by us and party to this arrangement remains the owner of either a credit deposit or a debit overdraft balance 
therefore  interest income is earned by legal entities with credit balances  while interest expense is charged to legal entities with debit balances 
based on the pool s aggregate balance  the bank then recalculates the overall interest to be charged or earned  compares this amount with the sum of previously charged earned interest amounts per account and additionally pays charges the difference 
the gross overdraft balance related to this pooling arrangement was million and million at june  and june   respectively 
however  on a net basis  we have surplus cash balances over all accounts for the respective periods

our principal source of cash is from the performance of services under contracts with our clients 
if we were unable to generate new contracts with existing and new clients or if the level of contract cancellations increased  our revenue and cash flow would be adversely affected see part i  item a risk factors for further detail 
absent a material adverse change in the level of our new business bookings or contract cancellations  we believe that our existing capital resources together with cash flow from operations and borrowing capacity under existing lines of credit will be sufficient to meet our foreseeable cash needs over the next twelve months and on a longer term basis 
depending upon our revenue and cash flow from operations  it is possible that we will require external funds to repay amounts outstanding under our credit agreement upon maturity in we expect to continue to acquire businesses to enhance our service and product offerings  expand our therapeutic expertise  and or increase our global presence 
depending on their size  any future acquisitions may require additional external financing  and we may from time to time seek to obtain funds from public or private issuances of equity or debt securities 
we may be unable to secure such financing at all or on terms acceptable to us  as a result of our outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement 
in addition  under the terms of the credit agreement  interest rates are fixed based on market indices at the time of borrowing and  depending upon the interest mechanism selected by us  may float thereafter 
as a result  the amount of interest payable by us on our borrowings may increase if market interest rates change 
however  we expect to mitigate the risk of increasing market interest rates with our hedging programs described below

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency rates  interest rates  and other relevant market rates or price changes 
in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to market risk resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  and we regularly evaluate our exposure to such changes 
our overall risk management strategy seeks to balance the magnitude of the exposure and the costs and availability of appropriate financial instruments 
foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates we derived approximately of our consolidated service revenue for the twelve months ended june  from operations outside of the us  including denominated in euros and denominated in pounds sterling 
we derived approximately of our consolidated service revenue for the twelve months ended june  from operations outside of the us  including denominated in euros and denominated in pounds sterling 
we do not have significant operations in countries in which the economy is considered to be highly inflationary 
our financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the translation of financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting our consolidated financial results 
it is our policy to mitigate the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and in market rates of interest 
accordingly  we have instituted foreign currency hedging programs and an interest rate swap program 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for more information on our hedging programs and interest rate swap program 
as of june   the programs with derivatives designated as hedging instruments under asc were deemed effective and the notional values of the derivatives were approximately million  including an interest rate swap agreement with a notional value of million in connection with our variable rate borrowings 
under certain circumstances  such as the occurrence of significant differences between actual cash receipts and forecasted cash receipts  the asc programs could be deemed ineffective 
in that event  the unrealized gains and losses related to these derivatives  and currently reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  would be recognized in earnings 
as of june   the estimated amount that could be recognized in other income was a loss of approximately million  net of tax 
this hedge will expire in september and we anticipate that it will be replaced by another instrument 
as of june   the notional value of derivatives primarily foreign exchange derivative that were not designated as hedging instruments under asc was approximately million 
the potential change in the fair value of these foreign currency exchange contracts that would result from a hypothetical change of in exchange rates would be approximately million 
during the twelve months ended june  and  we recorded foreign exchange losses of million and million  respectively 
we acknowledge our exposure to additional foreign exchange risk as it relates to assets and liabilities that are not part of the economic hedge program  but quantification of this risk is difficult to assess at any given point in time 
our exposure to interest rate changes relates primarily to the amount of our short term and long term debt 
short term debt was million at june  and million at june  long term debt was million at june  and million at june  marketable securities as of june   we held no marketable securities 
as of june   the value of our marketable securities was million
