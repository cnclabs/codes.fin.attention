part i items and business and properties general ivanhoe is an independent international heavy oil development and production company focused on pursuing long term growth in its reserve base and production using advanced technologies  including its htl technology 
core operations are in canada  ecuador  china and mongolia  with business development opportunities worldwide 
ivanhoe is the listed parent company and is responsible for canadian operations 
operations in latin american are conducted through ivanhoe energy latin america inc  while activities in china and southeast asia are operated by sunwing energy ltd 
sunwing 
we were incorporated pursuant to the laws of the yukon territory of canada  on february   under the name china holdings limited 
on june   we changed our name to black sea energy ltd 
on june   black sea energy ltd 
merged with sunwing  and we changed our name to ivanhoe 
in  ivanhoe completed a merger with ensyn group inc ensyn acquiring the proprietary  patented heavy oil upgrading process called htl 
in july  the company acquired oil sand assets in the athabasca region of canada 
later in  we signed a contract with the ecuador state oil companies to explore and develop ecuador s pungarayacu heavy oil field in block in  ivanhoe sold its wholly owned subsidiary  ivanhoe energy usa inc  disposing of all our oil and gas exploration and production operations in the united states us 
we also acquired a production sharing contract for the nyalga block xvi in mongolia in  through a merger with panasian petroleum inc  a privately owned corporation 
corporate strategy ivanhoe continues to pursue its core strategies  which are utilize long standing knowledge and relationships in the far east to pursue conventional oil and gas production and exploration opportunities  seek out heavy oil development projects globally that have operational needs that can benefit from our proprietary htl tm technology  and bias new country entry and business development to projects that  because of their remote setting  geo political status or operational needs  have been overlooked by the broader industry  subsequently expanding efforts in the new locations to more conventional oil and gas industry activities 
pursuing natural gas in china ivanhoe s wholly owned subsidiary  sunwing  has been conducting operations in china since the mid s 
in particular  sunwing is focused on a key natural gas exploration project the zitong block in sichuan province of china 
sichuan is the oldest and one of the most productive gas producing regions of china 
sinopec and petrochina have made significant gas discoveries in blocks adjacent to sunwing s zitong block 
the sichuan basin  located in central china approximately miles southwest of beijing  is the country s largest gas producing region  currently producing more than mmcf d and estimated by chinese officials to contain a natural gas resource potential of tcf 
there is a strong and growing local market for natural gas  with approximately million people living within the basin and with well developed grid connections to adjacent industrial and population areas 
natural gas sales are regulated in china and current prices are approximately mcf at the wellhead 
as part of china s commitment to develop cleaner sources of energy  demand for natural gas is projected to continue to grow in the country and sunwing s goal is to tap into this burgeoning market 

table of contents importance of the heavy oil segment of the oil and gas industry the global oil and gas industry is being impacted by the declining availability of low cost replacement reserves 
this has resulted in volatility in oil markets and marked shifts in the demand and supply landscape 
ivanhoe believes that long term demand and the natural decline of conventional oil production will see the development of higher cost and lower value resources  including heavy oil 
heavy oil developments can be segregated into two types conventional heavy oil that flows to the surface without steam enhancement and non conventional heavy oil and bitumen 
while the company focuses on the non conventional heavy oil  both types of oil play an important role in our corporate strategy 
production of conventional heavy oil has been steadily increasing worldwide  led by canada and latin america but with significant contributions from most other oil basins  including the middle east and the far east  as producers struggle to replace declines in light oil reserves 
even without the impact of the large non conventional heavy oil projects in canada and venezuela  world heavy oil production has become increasingly more common 
with regard to non conventional heavy oil and bitumen  a dramatic increase in interest and activity has been fueled by higher prices  in addition to various key advances in technology  including improved remote sensing  horizontal drilling and new thermal techniques 
this has enabled producers to more effectively access the extensive heavy oil resources around the world 
these newer technologies  together with higher oil prices  have generated increased interest in heavy oil resources 
nevertheless  remaining challenges for profitable exploitation include i the requirement for steam and electricity to help extract heavy oil  ii the need for diluent to move the oil once it is at the surface  iii the heavy versus light oil price differentials that the producer is faced with when the product gets to market  and iv conventional upgrading technologies are limited to very large scale  high capital cost facilities 
these challenges can lead to distressed assets  where economics are poor  or to stranded assets  where the resource cannot be economically produced and lies fallow 
ivanhoe s value proposition with the application of the htl process  ivanhoe seeks to address the key heavy oil development challenges and can do so at a relatively small minimum economic scale 
ivanhoe s htl upgrading is a partial upgrading process that is designed to operate in facilities as small as  to  bbls d 
this is substantially smaller than the minimum economic scale for conventional stand alone upgraders such as delayed cokers  which typically operate at scales of over  bbls d 
the htl process is based on carbon rejection  a tried and tested concept in heavy oil processing 
the key advantage of htl is that it is a very fast process  with processing times typically under a few seconds 
this results in smaller  less costly facilities and eliminates the need for hydrogen addition  an expensive  large minimum scale step typically required in conventional upgrading 
htl has the added advantage of converting the by products from the upgrading process into onsite energy  rather than generating large volumes of low value coke 
the htl process offers significant advantages as a field located upgrading alternative  integrated with the upstream heavy oil production operation 
htl provides four key benefits to the producer virtual elimination of external energy requirements for steam generation and or power for upstream operations  elimination of the need for diluent or blend oils for transport  capture of the majority of the heavy versus light oil value differential  and relatively small minimum economic scale of operations suited for field upgrading and for smaller field developments 
the economics of a project are effectively dictated by the advantages that htl can bring to a particular opportunity 
the more stranded the resource and the fewer monetization alternatives that the resource owner has  the greater the opportunity ivanhoe will have to establish its unique value proposition 
implementation strategy ivanhoe is an oil and gas company with a unique technology which addresses several major problems confronting the oil and gas industry today and the company believes it has a competitive advantage because of its patented upgrading process 
in addition  because ivanhoe has experienced thermal recovery teams  the company is in a position to add value and leverage its technology advantage by working with partners on stranded heavy oil resources around the world 

table of contents the company s continuing strategy is as follows advance its two key heavy oil projects in canada and ecuador 
continue to deploy personnel and financial resources in support of the company s goal to become a significant heavy oil producer 
advance the htl process 
additional development work will continue to advance the htl process through the commercial application of htl upgrading in canada  ecuador and beyond 
advance its natural gas project in the zitong block in sichuan province  china 
through its wholly owned subsidiary  sunwing energy  proceed with additional planning and operational analysis to develop an appraisal program leading to a full development plan for the zitong block 
enhance the company s financial position to support its major projects 
implementation of large projects requires significant capital outlays 
the company is working on various financing initiatives and establishing the relationships required for future development activities 
build internal capabilities 
the company continues to seek to build its internal leadership and technical capabilities through the addition of key personnel associated with each major project 
continue to deploy the personnel and the financial resources to capture additional opportunities for development projects utilizing the company s htl process 
commercialization of the company s upgrading process requires close alignment with partners  suppliers  host governments and financiers 
property descriptions our oil and gas operations are broken down into three geographic areas canada  ecuador and asia 
the business and technology development area captures costs incurred in the pursuit of projects throughout the world as well as expenses incurred to develop  enhance and identify improvements in the application of the htl technology 
production  revenues  net income  capital expenditures and identifiable assets for these segments appear in note to the consolidated financial statements and in the md a in this annual report 
integrated oil and gas properties canada tamarack  acquired in  is a  acre block located approximately miles northeast of fort mcmurray  alberta  canada 
ivanhoe holds a working interest in the property  subject only to a back in right held by talisman energy canada talisman  which expires in mid our independent reserve evaluator  glj petroleum consultants ltd 
glj  has assigned total p reserves of mmbbls of bitumen to tamarack 
it is anticipated that the resources will be developed utilizing steam assisted gravity drainage sagd technology 
the company expects that well pads and approximately sagd well pairs will be required to fully develop and produce the targeted resource base 
in march  a well winter delineation program was completed  which provided information necessary for regulatory filings 
in november  ivanhoe filed a comprehensive environmental impact assessment with the government of alberta 
in support of the application  basic engineering and design and front end engineering and design were completed to generate a class iii capital cost estimate 
subject to regulatory approvals from the alberta energy resources conservation board and alberta environment  construction at tamarack could commence in mid  with commissioning and start up of the production facilities expected in the fourth quarter of ecuador in october  ivanhoe energy ecuador inc  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary  signed a year contract with the ecuador state oil companies petroecuador and petroproduccion 
the contract gives us the right to explore and develop the pungarayacu heavy oil field in block  an area of square miles  approximately miles southeast of quito  ecuador s capital 
we anticipate using htl technology  as well as providing advanced oilfield technology  expertise and capital to develop  produce and upgrade heavy oil from the pungarayacu field 
the company may also explore for lighter oil in the contract area and use any light oil discoveries to blend with the heavy oil for delivery to petroproduccion 
in  the ip b well was successfully drilled  cored and logged to a total depth of  feet 
the well was perforated in the hollin oil sands and steam was successfully injected into the reservoir resulting in production of heated heavy oil 
the company s ip well  drilled in  encountered certain cementing and completion problems during steam injection operations and testing at the well was suspended without recovering oil 
ivanhoe sees significant variability between the two well locations  supporting the view that geological faulting is prevalent in block due to the close proximity of the andes  directly to the west of the block 
we plan to commence a seismic program following testing operations at ip b to increase understanding of the geological faulting and to help determine locations for our next appraisal wells 

table of contents conventional oil and gas properties asia china zitong in november  we entered into a year production sharing contract with china national petroleum corporation cnpc for the zitong block  which covers an area of approximately  gross acres after contractual relinquishments in the sichuan basin 
the parties will jointly participate in the development and production of any commercially viable deposits  with production rights limited to the later of or years of continuous production 
in  we farmed out of our working interest in the zitong block to mitsubishi gas chemical company inc of japan for million 
in phase i of the contract  ivanhoe reprocessed  miles of existing d seismic data and acquired miles of new d seismic data 
two wells were drilled and although both wells encountered expected reservoirs and gas was tested on the second well  neither well demonstrated commercially viable flow rates and both wells were suspended 
in phase ii  two wells were drilled in at the zitong block  both resulting in gas discoveries 
the yixin well was tested in december with gas flowing from the xu formation 
following initial flow and pressure tests  the well was shut in for pressure build up 
the zitong well reached total depth in december and was tested in january  with gas flowing from the xu formation 
the well was subsequently shut in to record reservoir pressure build up and allow testing of the shallower  xu formation 
following the drilling of the zitong and yixin wells  areas excluding those identified for development and future production were to be relinquished 
in january  ivanhoe received notice that the exploration period has been extended for an additional six months 
dagang ivanhoe s oil production originates in the kongnan oilfield in dagang  hebei province  china the dagang field 
we have a year production sharing contract with cnpc  covering an area of  gross acres 
from to  we drilled wells and commercial production commenced on january  the project reached cost recovery in september and our working interest decreased to 
operations in the dagang field will revert to cnpc at the end of the year production phase of the contract or earlier if the field is abandoned 
in  quotas restricted production to  gross tonnes or  bbls d gross 
actual production in averaged bbls d net 
production quotas in are set at  gross tonnes or approximately  bbls d gross 
mongolia through a merger with panasian petroleum inc in november  we acquired a production sharing contract for the nyalga block xvi in the khenti and tov provinces in mongolia 
the block covers an area of approximately million gross acres  after a relinquishment in the five year exploration period is divided into three consecutive phases  consisting of two years phase i  one year phase ii and two years phase iii  with the ability to nominate a two year extension following phase i or phase ii 
during the initial seismic program  approximately of the block in the delgerkhaan area was declared by the mongolian government to be a historical site and operations in this area were suspended 
a letter from the mineral resources and petroleum authority of mongolia mrpam stated that the obligations under year one of phase i would be extended for one year from the time the company is allowed to re enter the suspended area 
to date  access has not been granted and discussions with mrpam are ongoing 
as a result  the government has adjusted the dates in which the project year begins 
phase ii is now considered to have commenced on july  
table of contents from late through the first quarter of  the company acquired an additional kilometres of d seismic across block xvi  for a total of kilometres of d seismic data over the kherulen sub basin 
in  preparations commenced for a five well drilling program and a seismic acquisition program 
the first exploratory location has been identified and we expect to initiate drilling operations in mongolia in the first half of reserves  production and related information in addition to the information provided below  please refer to the supplementary disclosures about oil and gas production activities unaudited set forth in item in this annual report for certain details regarding the company s oil and gas proved reserves  the estimation process and production by country 
we have not filed with nor included in reports to any other us federal authority or agency  any estimates of total proved oil reserves since the beginning of the last fiscal year 
the following table presents estimated proved  probable and possible oil reserves as of december  summary of oil and gas reserves using average prices canada china mbbl tamarack dagang other total proved developed undeveloped total proved probable developed undeveloped possible developed undeveloped reserves are the company s total gross reserves before royalty deductions 
canada probable and possible reserves in  probable and possible reserves increased from nil in to  mbbls as a result of completing a well delineation drilling program on the tamarack lands  further technical evaluation and the submission of ivanhoe s regulatory application to the government of alberta in november further reserve development is subject to regulatory approval and availability of financing 
possible reserves are within the tamarack project application area  but have a lower degree of certainty compared to our probable reserves due to lower quality reservoir characteristics or decreased certainty based on the level of reservoir delineation 
basis of reserves estimates probable and possible reserves will be developed using a sagd thermal recovery process  which has been successfully demonstrated in similar projects in the athabasca oil sands region 
recovery estimates for tamarack are based on applying appropriate recovery factors to original oil in place estimates developed through detailed reservoir characterization 
the reservoir characterization is based on information gathered during historical field delineation programs 
recovery factors applied to the oil in place estimates are the result of simulation and analytical models  incorporating the actual performance of existing analog projects 

table of contents china proved reserves proved reserves at december   were  mbbls compared to  mbbls at december   an increase of after production 
proved reserves increased due to in field performance improvements from continued water injections  a partial natural water drive and our ongoing hydraulic fracture stimulation program in the dagang field 
drilling activity in late december was successful and  in combination with geological review and reservoir mapping  supported additional future drilling locations 
proved reserves also benefitted from a pool extension due to the addition of re activated wells in the periphery of the reservoir 
the transfer of reserves from proved undeveloped to the proved category was immaterial in probable reserves at december   probable reserves in china were mbbls  an increase of over the mbbls reported at december  additional probable reserves were assigned based on production improvements and increased recovery factors discussed under proved reserves 
basis of reserve estimates reserve estimates were calculated using recovery forecasts based on historical production  supported by volumetric estimates using geological parameters 
recoveries rarely exceed of the volumetrically calculated original oil in place per well spacing  which is judged acceptable for a water flood in a light oil reservoir 
improvements in production history and production declines are used for a review of producing reserves 
with further mapping and geological reviews  proved and probable undeveloped reserves may then be assigned to future drilling and well optimizations 
internal control over reserve estimation management is responsible for the estimates of oil and gas reserves and for preparing related disclosures 
estimates and related disclosures are prepared in accordance with sec requirements  generally accepted industry practices in the us and the standards of the canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook modified to reflect sec requirements 
our reserve estimates and disclosures may differ from other canadian issuers who follow national instrument  standards of disclosure for oil and gas activities ni 
significant differences between sec and canadian reserve estimates and disclosures are described in the special note to canadian investors on page the process of estimating reserves requires complex judgments and decision making based on available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
to estimate the economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and related future net cash flows  we consider many factors and make various assumptions including expected reservoir characteristics based on geological  geophysical and engineering assessments  future production rates based on historical performance and expected future operating and investment activities  future oil and gas prices and quality differentials  assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies  and future development and operating costs 
we believe these factors and assumptions are reasonable based on the information available to us at the time we prepared our estimates 
however  these estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production performance becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change 
reserve estimates are categorized by the level of confidence that they will be economically recoverable 
proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions  operating methods and government regulations 
the term reasonable certainty implies a high degree of confidence that the quantities of oil and gas actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate 
to achieve reasonable certainty  the technologies used in the estimation process have been demonstrated to yield results with consistency and repeatability 

table of contents probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which  together with proved reserves  are as likely as not to be recovered 
therefore  probable reserves have a higher degree of uncertainty than proved reserves 
possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves 
although possible reserve locations are found by stepping out from proved reserve locations  estimates of probable and possible reserves are  by their nature  more speculative than estimates of proved reserves and  accordingly  are subject to substantially greater risk of being realized 
our reserve estimates were prepared by glj and reviewed by our in house senior engineering advisor sea 
our sea is a professional engineer  with over years of experience in the oil industry focused on heavy oil recovery techniques 
his past experience includes international positions responsible for thermal horizontal and vertical well development projects using state of the art reservoir management techniques and advanced d reservoir visualization methods to integrate complex data sets 
he has experience supervising project expansions and investigating new development scenarios using reservoir simulation and advanced economic modeling 
all reserve information in this annual report is based on estimates prepared by glj 
the technical personnel responsible for preparing the reserve estimates at glj meet the requirements regarding qualifications  independence  objectivity and confidentiality set forth in the standards pertaining to the estimating and auditing of oil and gas by the society of petroleum engineers 
glj is an independent firm of petroleum engineers  geologists  geophysicists and petrophysicists  they do not own an interest in our properties and are not employed on a contingent fee basis

special note to canadian investors ivanhoe is a sec registrant and files annual reports on form k  accordingly  our reserves estimates and regulatory securities disclosures are prepared based on sec disclosure requirements 
in  certain canadian securities regulatory authorities adopted ni which prescribes standards that canadian companies are required to follow in the preparation and disclosure of reserves and related information 
in  we re applied for  and received  exemptions from certain ni requirements 
these exemptions permit us to substitute disclosures based on sec requirements for much of the annual disclosure required by ni and to prepare our reserves estimates and related disclosures in accordance with sec requirements  generally accepted industry practices in the us as promulgated by the society of petroleum engineers and the standards of the canadian oil and gas evaluation handbook the coge handbook modified to reflect sec requirements

 disclosures about oil and gas producing activities 
such information differs from the corresponding information prepared in accordance with canadian disclosure standards under ni the primary differences between the current sec requirements and the ni requirements are as follows sec registrants apply sec reserves definitions and prepare their reserves estimates in accordance with sec requirements and generally accepted industry practices in the us  whereas ni requires adherence to the definitions and standards promulgated by the coge handbook  the sec mandates disclosure of proved reserves calculated using an average  first day of the month price during the month period preceding and existing costs only  whereas ni requires disclosure of reserves and related future net revenues using forecasted prices  with additional constant pricing disclosure being optional  the sec mandates disclosure of reserves by geographic area only  whereas ni requires disclosure of more reserve categories and product types  and the sec leaves the engagement of independent qualified reserves evaluators to the discretion of a company s board of directors  whereas ni requires issuers to engage such evaluators 
the foregoing is a general and non exhaustive description of the principal differences between sec disclosure requirements and ni requirements

the tamarack lease in canada will expire in october  but ivanhoe has sufficient drill density to be granted a continuation by the alberta department of energy one year prior to expiry or upon first production  whichever comes first 
although production activities from the tamarack lease is anticipated to commence in  we plan to apply for a continuation of the lease prior to its expiration if the project is delayed 
we signed a specific services contract with affiliated entities of the state of ecuador in october that allows us to develop block for a term of years  extendable by mutual agreement of the parties  for two additional periods of five years each  depending on the interests of the state and in conformity with local laws 
acreage in the dagang field will return to cnpc in following the completion of phase ii of the zitong contract  the remaining acreage must be relinquished to cnpc except for areas identified for development and future production  which will be relinquished upon termination of the production sharing contract in 
table of contents acreage in mongolia is subject to periodic relinquishments up to the end of the exploration period and the remaining acreage designated for appraisal and development will expire years after the final commercial discovery on the nyalga block 
business and technology development the company s business and technology development segment captures htl activities as well as costs associated with the pursuit of new business development opportunities 
technology development in april  ivanhoe acquired ensyn and thereby obtained an exclusive  irrevocable license to the htl process for all applications other than biomass 
we have since continued to expand patent coverage to protect innovations to the htl technology and to significantly extend ivanhoe s portfolio of htl intellectual property 
ivanhoe is the assignee of three granted us patents and currently has three us patent applications pending 
in other countries  patents are pending 
in addition  ivanhoe owns exclusive  irrevocable licenses to global patents as well as proprietary technological knowledge for the rapid thermal processing process of petroleum 
ivanhoe operates a feedstock test facility ftf at the southwest research institute in san antonio  texas 
the ftf is a small bbls d  highly flexible state of the art facility which will permit analysis of crude oil in small volumes 
in  the ftf was used to support basic and front end engineering for a commercial scale htl plant for the tamarack project in canada 
also  the unit was used to support conceptual design for several projects  including pungarayacu in ecuador 
as we continue to advance our technology  the ftf will serve an integral role in supporting the company s commercial operations 
the ftf replaced the commercial demonstration facility cdf  constructed in the cdf was decommissioned in and all future testing will be conducted at the ftf 
business development the company pursues htl business development opportunities globally  with an emphasis on creating value from stranded resources or resource accumulations considered too small to be economically viable using other technologies 
in  htl tm heavy oil and selected conventional oil opportunities were pursued in north and south america  the middle east and north africa 
certain factors affecting the business competition the oil and gas industry is highly competitive 
our position in the oil and gas industry  which includes the search for and development of new sources of supply  is particularly competitive 
our competitors include major  intermediate and junior oil and gas companies and other individual producers and operators  many of which have substantially greater financial and human resources and more developed and extensive infrastructure 
our larger competitors  by reason of their size and relative financial strength  can more easily access capital markets and may enjoy a competitive advantage in the recruitment of qualified personnel 
they may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business more easily  adversely affecting our competitive position 
our competitors may be able to pay more for producing oil and gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for  and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects 
further  these companies may enjoy technological advantages and may be able to implement new technologies more rapidly 
our ability to acquire additional properties in the future will depend upon our ability to conduct efficient operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties  implement advanced technologies  and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
the oil and gas industry also competes with other industries in supplying energy  fuel and other needs of consumers 

table of contents environmental regulations our conventional oil and gas and htl operations are subject to various levels of government laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment in the countries in which we operate 
we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws 
environmental legislation imposes  among other things  restrictions  liabilities and obligations in connection with the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and waste and in connection with spills  releases and emissions of various substances to the environment 
as well  environmental regulations are imposed on the qualities and compositions of the products sold and imported 
environmental legislation also requires that wells  facility sites and other properties associated with our operations be operated  maintained  abandoned and reclaimed to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities 
in addition  certain types of operations  including exploration and development projects and significant changes to certain existing projects  may require the submission and approval of environmental impact assessments 
compliance with environmental legislation can require significant expenditures and failure to comply with environmental legislation may result in the imposition of fines and penalties and liability for clean up costs and damages 
we anticipate that changes in environmental legislation may require  among other things  reductions in emissions to the air from our operations and result in increased capital expenditures 
operations in canada are governed by comprehensive federal  provincial and municipal regulations 
we have submitted the regulatory application environmental impact assessment for the tamarack project to the government of alberta 
the regulatory process is expected to take approximately to months 
in addition  the company will be required to obtain numerous ancillary approvals prior to commencing operations and will be subject to ongoing environmental monitoring and auditing requirements 
china  mongolia and ecuador continue to develop and implement more stringent environmental protection regulations and standards for different industries 
projects are currently monitored by governments based on the approved standards specified in the environmental impact statement prepared for individual projects 
government regulations our business is subject to certain federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulations in the regions in which we operate relating to the exploration for  and development  production and marketing of  crude oil and gas  as well as environmental and safety matters 
in addition  the chinese government regulates various aspects of foreign company operations in china 
such laws and regulations have generally become more stringent in recent years in the us  canada  ecuador and china  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed  we are not able to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
employees as at december   we had employees actively engaged in the business 
none of our employees are unionized 
item a risk factors our operations are exposed to various risks  some of which are common to others in the oil and gas industry and some of which are unique to our operations 
certain risks set out below constitute forward looking statements and readers should refer to the special note regarding forward looking statements set out on page of this annual report 
our ability to continue as a going concern may be adversely affected by inadequate funding we have a history of operating losses and cash flow from operating activities will not be sufficient to meet our current obligations and fund future capital projects 
historically  we have relied upon equity capital as our principal source of funding 
continuation of the company is dependent upon our ability to obtain additional capital to preserve our interests in current projects and to meet obligations associated with future projects 
we may seek financing from a combination of strategic investors and or public and private debt and equity markets  either at a parent company level or at the project level 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all  and any future equity issuances may be dilutive to investors 
obtaining financing may be hampered by the inability to attract strategic investors to our projects on acceptable terms  volatility in equity and debt markets and a sustained decrease in the market price of our common shares 
without access to financing  we may not be able to continue as a going concern 

table of contents we may not be able to fund our substantial capital requirements our business is capital intensive and the advancement of our exploration projects in china and mongolia  development projects in canada and ecuador and htl initiatives require significant funding 
since cash flows from existing operations are insufficient to fund future capital expenditures  we intend to finance future capital projects with a combination of strategic investors and or public and private debt and equity markets  either at a parent company level or at the project level or from the sale of existing assets 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all  and any future equity issuances may be dilutive to investors 
obtaining financing in the future may be hampered by the inability to attract strategic investors to our projects on acceptable terms  volatility in equity and debt markets and a sustained decrease in the market price of our common shares 
if we fail to obtain adequate funding when needed  we may have to delay or forego potentially valuable project acquisition and development opportunities or default on existing funding commitments to third parties and forfeit or dilute our rights in existing oil and gas property interests 
we have fixed and contingent payment obligations to talisman as a result of acquiring our athabasca heavy oil leases from talisman in  we have fixed and contingent payment obligations to talisman 
these obligations include a cdn million convertible promissory note the convertible note that  unless converted into ivanhoe common shares  is due in july  and a contingent payment of up to cdn million that will become due and payable if and when the requisite government and other approvals to develop the northern border of one of the athabasca heavy oil leases are obtained 
we intend to finance such future payments through debt and equity markets  arrangements with third parties  either at the ivanhoe parent company level or at the subsidiary or project level or from the sale of existing assets 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all  and any future equity issuances may be dilutive to investors 
obtaining financing in the future may be hampered by the inability to attract strategic investors to our projects on acceptable terms  volatility in equity and debt markets and a sustained decrease in the market price of our common shares 
failure to obtain such additional financing could put us in default of our obligations to talisman  which are secured by a first fixed charge and security interest in favor of talisman over the athabasca heavy oil leases and a general security interest in all of our present and after acquired property other than the common shares we own in our subsidiaries 
in the case of such default  talisman could foreclose on the secured assets  including the leases 
the volatility of oil prices may affect our financial results our revenues  operating results  profitability and future growth are highly dependent on the price of oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital 
even relatively modest changes in oil prices may significantly change our revenues  results of operations  cash flows and proved reserves 
historically  the market for oil has been volatile and is likely to continue to be volatile in the future 
oil prices may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  such as weather conditions  overall global economic conditions  terrorist attacks or military conflicts  political and economic conditions in oil producing countries  the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls  the level of demand and the price and availability of alternative fuels  speculation in the commodity futures markets  technological advances affecting energy consumption  governmental regulations and approvals  and proximity and capacity of oil pipelines and other transportation facilities 
these factors and the volatility of the energy markets make it extremely difficult to predict future oil price movements with any certainty 
we may be required to take write downs if oil prices decline  our estimated development costs increase or our exploration results deteriorate we may be required to write down the carrying value of our properties if oil prices decline or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves  increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our exploration results 
see critical accounting principles and estimates impairment in item  md a  of this annual report 
estimates of proved reserves and future net revenue may change if the assumptions on which such estimates are based prove to be inaccurate our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment  the assumptions used regarding prices for oil and gas  production volumes  required levels of operating and capital expenditures and quantities of recoverable oil reserves 
any significant variance from the assumptions used could result in the actual quantity of our reserves and future net cash flow being materially different from the estimates we report 
in addition  actual results of drilling  testing and production and changes in oil and gas prices after the date of the estimate may result in revisions to our reserve estimates 
revisions to prior estimates may be material 

table of contents we may incur significant costs on exploration or development efforts which may prove unsuccessful or unprofitable there can be no assurance that the costs we incur on exploration or development will result in an acceptable level of economic return 
we may misinterpret geological or engineering data  which may result in material losses from unsuccessful exploration or development drilling efforts 
we bear the risks of project delays and cost overruns due to unexpected geologic conditions  equipment failures  equipment delivery delays  accidents  adverse weather  government and joint venture partner approval delays  construction or start up delays  and other associated risks 
such risks may delay expected production and or increase production costs 
we compete for oil and gas properties and personnel with many other exploration and development companies throughout the world who have access to greater resources we operate in a highly competitive environment and compete with oil and gas companies and other individual producers and operators  many of which have longer operating histories and substantially greater financial and other resources 
many of these companies not only explore for and produce oil and gas  but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a worldwide basis 
we also compete with companies in other industries supplying energy  fuel and other needs to consumers 
our larger competitors  by reason of their size and relative financial strength  can more easily access capital markets and may enjoy a competitive advantage in the recruitment of qualified personnel 
they may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business and handle longer periods of reduced oil and gas prices more easily 
our competitors may be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects 
we compete with other companies to recruit and retain the limited number of individuals who possess the requisite skills and experience that are relevant to our business 
this competition exposes us to the risk that we will have to pay increased compensation to such employees or increase the company s reliance and associated costs from partnering or outsourcing arrangements 
there can be no assurance that employees with the abilities and expertise we require will be available 
changes to laws  regulations and government policies in the jurisdictions in which we operate could adversely affect our ability to develop our projects our projects in canada  ecuador  china and mongolia are subject to various international  federal  state  provincial  territorial and local laws and regulations relating to the exploration for and the development  production  upgrading  marketing  pricing  taxation and transportation of heavy oil  bitumen and related products and other matters  including environmental protection 
the exercise of discretion by governmental authorities under existing legislation and regulations  the amendment of existing legislation and regulations or the implementation of new legislation or regulations  affecting the oil and gas industry could materially increase the cost of developing and operating our projects and could have a material adverse impact on our business 
there can be no assurance that laws  regulations and government policies relevant to our projects will not be changed in a manner which may adversely affect our ability to develop and operate them 
failure to obtain all necessary permits  leases  licenses and approvals  or failure to obtain them on a timely basis  could result in delays or restructuring of our projects and increase costs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
construction  operation and decommissioning of these projects will be conditional upon the receipt of necessary permits  leases  licenses and other approvals from applicable government and regulatory authorities 
the approval process can involve stakeholder consultation  environmental impact assessments  public hearings and appeals to tribunals and courts  among other things 
an inability to secure local and regional community support could result in the necessary approvals being delayed or denied 
there is no assurance that such approvals will be issued  or if granted  will not be appealed or cancelled or will be renewed upon expiry or will not contain terms and conditions that adversely affect the final design or economics of our projects 

table of contents complying with environmental and other government regulations could be costly and could negatively impact our production our operations are governed by various international  federal  state  provincial  territorial and local laws and regulations 
oil  gas  oil sands and heavy oil extraction  upgrading and transportation operations are subject to extensive regulation 
various approvals are required before such activities may be undertaken 
we are subject to laws and regulations that govern the operation and maintenance of our facilities  the discharge of materials into the environment and other environmental protection issues 
these laws and regulations may  among other potential consequences  require that we acquire permits before commencing drilling  restrict the substances that can be released into the environment with drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities in protected areas such as wetlands or wilderness areas  require that reclamation measures be taken to prevent pollution from former operations  require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former operations  such as plugging abandoned wells and remediating contaminated soil and groundwater  and require remedial measures be taken with respect to property designated as a contaminated site 
the costs of complying with environmental laws and regulations in the future may harm our business 
furthermore  future changes in environmental laws and regulations may result in stricter standards and enforcement  larger fines and liability  and increased capital expenditures and operating costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
no assurance can be given with respect to the impact of future environmental laws or the approvals  processes or other requirements thereunder or our ability to develop or operate our projects in a manner consistent with our current expectations 
no assurance can be given that environmental laws will not limit project development or materially increase the cost of production  development or exploration activities or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or prospects 
our business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses  insurance may not protect us against all these risks our operations are subject to many risks inherent in the oil and gas industry  including fires  natural disasters  adverse weather conditions  explosions  encountering formations with abnormal pressures  encountering unusual or unexpected geological formations  blowouts  cratering  unexpected operational events  equipment malfunctions  pipeline ruptures  spills  compliance with environmental and government regulations and title problems  any of which could cause us to experience material losses 
we are insured against some  but not all  of the hazards associated with our business  so we may sustain losses that could be substantial due to events that are not insured or are underinsured 
the occurrence of an event that is not covered or not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not carry business interruption insurance and  therefore  the loss and delay of revenues resulting from curtailed production are not insured 
under environmental laws and regulations  we could be liable for personal injury  clean up costs and other environmental and property damages  as well as administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
we maintain limited insurance coverage for sudden and accidental environmental damages as well as environmental damage that occurs over time 
however  we do not believe that insurance coverage for the full potential liability of environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost 
accordingly  we could be liable  or could be required to cease production  if environmental damage occurs 
sagd technologies for in situ recovery of heavy oil and bitumen are energy intensive and may be unsustainable we intend to integrate established sagd thermal recovery techniques with our patented htl upgrading process 
heavy oil recovery using the sagd process is subject to technical and financial uncertainty 
current sagd technologies for in situ recovery of heavy oil and bitumen are energy intensive  requiring significant consumption of natural gas and other fuels for the production of steam used in the recovery process 
the amount of steam required in the production process can also vary and impact costs 
the performance of the reservoir can also impact the timing and levels of production using sagd technology 
while the technology is now being used by several producers  commercial application of this technology is still in the early stages relative to other methods of production and  accordingly  in the absence of an extended operating history  there can be no assurances with respect to the sustainability of sagd operations 
we may not successfully commercialize our htl technology success in commercializing our htl technology in the oil and gas industry depends on our ability to economically design  construct and operate commercial scale plants and a variety of other factors  many of which are outside our control 
to date  commercial scale htl plants have only been constructed in the bio mass industry 

table of contents technological advances could render our htl technology obsolete we expect that technological advances in the processes and procedures for upgrading heavy oil and bitumen into lighter  less viscous products will continue to progress 
it is possible that those advances could cause our htl technology to become uncompetitive or obsolete 
alternate sources of energy could lower the demand for our htl technology alternative sources of energy are continually under development 
if reliance upon petroleum based fuels decreases  the demand for our htl upgraded product may decline 
it is possible that technological advances in engine design and performance could reduce the use of petroleum based fuels  which would also lower the demand for our htl upgraded product 
efforts to commercialize our htl technology may give rise to claims of infringement upon the patents or other proprietary rights of others we own a license to use the htl technology that we are seeking to commercialize  but we may not become aware of claims of infringement upon the patents or other rights of others in this technology until after we have made a substantial investment in the development and commercialization of projects utilizing the technology 
third parties may claim that the technology infringes upon past  present or future patented technologies 
legal actions could be brought against us and our licensors claiming damages and seeking an injunction that would prevent us from testing or commercializing the technology 
if an infringement action were successful  in addition to potential liability for damages  we and our licensors could be required to obtain a claiming party s license in order to continue to test or commercialize the technology 
any required license might not be made available or  if available  might not be available on acceptable terms  and we could be prevented entirely from testing or commercializing the technology 
we may have to expend substantial resources in litigation defending against the infringement claims of others 
many possible claimants  such as the major energy companies that have or may be developing proprietary heavy oil upgrading technologies competitive with our technology  may have significantly more resources to spend on litigation 
a breach of confidentiality obligations could put us at competitive risk and potentially damage our business while discussing potential business relationships with third parties  we may disclose confidential information on operating results or proprietary intellectual property 
although confidentiality agreements are signed by third parties prior to the disclosure of any confidential information  a breach could put us at competitive risk and may cause significant damage to our business 
the harm to our business from a breach of confidentiality cannot presently be quantified  but may be material and may not be compensable in damages 
there is no assurance that  in the event of a breach of confidentiality  we will be able to obtain equitable remedies  such as injunctive relief  from a court of competent jurisdiction in a timely manner  if at all  in order to prevent or mitigate any damage to our business that such a breach of confidentiality may cause 
certain projects are at a very early stage of development our projects are at varying stages of development 
we have submitted the regulatory application environmental impact assessment for the tamarack project to the government of alberta 
the regulatory process is expected to take approximately to months  however  there is no assurance that the process will be completed on a timely basis and construction of the tamarack project could be significantly delayed 
the government of alberta may not approve the project as proposed  or it may place certain conditions upon the approval  which could significantly impair the economics of the project 
our zitong project in china and projects in ecuador and mongolia are at a very early stage of development  no reserves have yet been established and no detailed feasibility or engineering studies have yet been produced 
there can be no assurances that these projects will be completed within any time frame or within the parameters of any determined capital cost 
we have yet to establish a defined schedule for financing and fully developing such projects 
in our efforts to continue developing these projects  we may experience delays  interruption of operations or increased costs as a result of unanticipated events and circumstances 
these include breakdowns or failures of equipment or processes  construction performance falling below expected levels of output or efficiency  design errors  challenges to proprietary technology  contractor or operator errors  non performance by third party contractors  labor disputes  disruptions or declines in productivity  increases in materials or labor costs  inability to attract sufficient numbers of qualified workers  delays in obtaining  or conditions imposed by  regulatory approvals  violation of permit requirements  disruption in the supply of energy  and catastrophic events such as fires  earthquakes  storms or explosions 

table of contents our heavy oil project in canada may be exposed to title risks and aboriginal claims we have not obtained title opinions in respect of the athabasca heavy oil leases we acquired from talisman and there is a risk that our ownership of those leases may be subject to prior unregistered agreements or interests or undetected claims or interests that could impair our title 
any such impairment could jeopardize our entitlement to the economic benefits  if any  associated with the leases  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and ability to execute our business plans in a timely manner  if at all 
aboriginal peoples have claimed aboriginal title and rights to large areas of land in western canada where oil and gas operations are conducted  including a claim filed against the government of canada  the province of alberta  certain governmental entities and the regional municipality of wood buffalo which includes the city of fort mcmurray  alberta claiming  among other things  aboriginal title to large areas of lands surrounding fort mcmurray where most of the oil sands operations in alberta are located 
such claims  if successful  could affect the title to our heavy oil leases and have a material adverse effect on our business 
our investment in ecuador may be at risk if the agreement through which we hold our interest in the block project is challenged or cannot be enforced we hold our interest in the block heavy oil project in ecuador through a services agreement with petroecuador and its subsidiary petroproduccion 
the agreement is governed by the laws of ecuador 
although the agreement has been translated into english  the official and governing language of the agreement is spanish and if any discrepancy exists between the official spanish version of the agreement and the english translation  the official spanish version prevails 
there may be ambiguities  inconsistencies and anomalies between the official spanish version of the agreement and the english translation that could materially affect how our rights and obligations under the agreement are conclusively interpreted and such interpretations may be materially adverse to our interests 
the dispute resolution provisions of the block agreement stipulate that disputes involving industrial property  including intellectual property  and technical or economic issues are subject to international arbitration 
other disputes are subject to resolution through mediation or arbitration in ecuador 
there is a risk that we  and the other parties to the block agreement  will be unable to agree upon the proper forum for the resolution of a dispute based on the subject matter of the dispute 
there can also be no assurance that the other parties will comply with the dispute resolution provisions or otherwise voluntarily submit to arbitration 
government policy in ecuador may change to discourage foreign investment or requirements not foreseen may be implemented 
there can be no assurance that our investments and assets in ecuador will not be subject to nationalization  requisition or confiscation  whether legitimate or not  by any authority or body 
while the block agreement contains provisions for compensation and reimbursement of losses we may suffer under such circumstances  there is no assurance that such provisions would effectively restore the value of our original investment 
there can be no assurance that ecuadorian laws protecting foreign investments will not be amended or abolished or that the existing laws will be enforced or interpreted to provide adequate protection against any or all of the risks described above 
there can also be no assurance that the block agreement will prove to be enforceable or provide adequate protection against any or all of the risks described above 
our business may be harmed if we are unable to retain our interests in licenses  leases and production sharing contracts some of our properties are held under licenses and leases  working interests in licenses and leases or production sharing contracts 
if we fail to meet the specific requirements of the instrument through which we hold our interest  it may terminate or expire 
we may not be able to meet any or all of the obligations required to maintain our interest in each such license  lease or production sharing contract 
some of our property interests will terminate unless we fulfill such obligations 
if we are unable to satisfy these obligations on a timely basis  we may lose our rights in these properties 
the termination of our interests in these properties may harm our business 
our principal shareholder may significantly influence our business as at the date of this annual report  our largest shareholder  robert m 
friedland  owned approximately of our common shares 
as a result  he has the voting power to significantly influence our policies  business and affairs and the outcome of any corporate transaction or other matter  including mergers  consolidations and the sale of all  or substantially all  of our assets 
in addition  the concentration of our ownership may have the effect of delaying  deterring or preventing a change in control that otherwise could result in a premium in the price of our common shares 

table of contents if we lose our key management and technical personnel  our business may suffer we rely upon a relatively small group of key management personnel 
given the technological nature of our business  we also rely heavily upon our scientific and technical personnel 
our ability to implement our business strategy may be constrained and the timing of implementation may be impacted if we are unable to attract and retain sufficient personnel 
we do not maintain any key man insurance 
we do not have employment agreements with certain of our key management and technical personnel and we cannot assure that these individuals will remain with us in the future 
an unexpected partial or total loss of their services would harm our business 
information regarding our future plans reflects our current intent and is subject to change we describe our current exploration and development plans in this annual report 
whether we ultimately implement our plans will depend on the availability and cost of capital  the htl technology process test results  additional seismic data or reprocessed existing data  current and projected oil or gas prices  costs and availability of drilling rigs and other equipment  supplies  personnel  success or failure of activities in similar areas  changes in estimates of project completion costs  and our ability to attract other industry partners to acquire a portion of the working interest to reduce costs and exposure to risks 
we will continue to gather data about our projects and it is possible that additional information will cause us to alter our schedule or determine that a project should not be pursued at all 
our plans regarding our projects might change

dividends we have not paid any dividends on our outstanding common shares since we were incorporated and we do not anticipate that we will do so in the foreseeable future 
the declaration of dividends on our common shares is  subject to certain statutory restrictions described below  within the discretion of our board of directors based on their assessment of  among other factors  our earnings or lack thereof  our capital and operating expenditure requirements and our overall financial condition 
under the yukon business corporations act  our board of directors has no discretion to declare or pay a dividend on our common shares if they have reasonable grounds for believing that we are  or after payment of the dividend would be  unable to pay our liabilities as they become due or that the realizable value of our assets would  as a result of the dividend  be less than the aggregate sum of our liabilities and the stated capital of our common shares 
exemptions from certain nasdaq marketplace rules as a canadian issuer listed on nasdaq  we are not required to comply with certain of nasdaq s marketplace rules and instead may comply with applicable canadian requirements 
as a foreign private issuer  we are only required to comply with the following nasdaq rules i we must have an audit committee that satisfies applicable nasdaq requirements and that is composed of directors each of whom satisfy nasdaq s prescribed independence standards  ii we must provide nasdaq with prompt notification after an executive officer of the company becomes aware of any material non compliance by us with any applicable nasdaq marketplace rule  iii our common shares must be eligible for a direct registration program operated by a clearing agency registered under section a of the exchange act  and iv we must provide a brief description of any significant differences between our corporate governance practices and those followed by us companies quoted on nasdaq 
applicable canadian rules pertaining to corporate governance require us to disclose in our management proxy circular  on an annual basis  our corporate governance practices  including whether or not our independent directors hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present  but there is no legal requirement in canada for independent directors to hold regularly scheduled meetings at which only independent directors are present 
although our independent directors hold meetings from time to time  as and when considered necessary or desirable by the independent lead director or by any other independent director  such meetings are not regularly scheduled 

table of contents enforceability of civil liabilities we are a company incorporated under the laws of the yukon territory of canada 
some of our directors  controlling shareholders  officers and representatives of the experts named in this annual report reside outside the us and a substantial portion of their assets and our assets are located outside the us 
as a result  it may be difficult to effect service of process within the us upon the directors  controlling shareholders  officers and representatives of experts who are not residents of the us or to enforce against them judgments obtained in the courts of the us based upon the civil liability provisions of the federal securities laws or other laws of the us 
there is doubt as to the enforceability in canada  against us or against any of our directors  controlling shareholders  officers or experts who are not residents of the us  in original actions or in actions for enforcement of judgments of us courts  of liabilities based solely upon civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws 
therefore  it may not be possible to enforce those actions against us  our directors  officers  controlling shareholders or experts named in this annual report 
exchange controls and taxation there is no law or governmental decree or regulation in canada that restricts the export or import of capital  or affects the remittance of dividends  interest or other payments to a non resident holder of our common shares  other than withholding tax requirements 
there is no limitation imposed by the laws of canada  the laws of the yukon territory  or our constating documents on the right of a non resident to hold or vote our common shares  other than as provided in the investment canada act canada the investment act  which generally prohibits a reviewable investment by an investor that is not a canadian  as defined  unless after review  the minister responsible for the investment act is satisfied that the investment is likely to be of net benefit to canada 
an investment in our common shares by a non canadian who is not a wto investor which includes governments of  or individuals who are nationals of  member states of the world trade organization and corporations and other entities which are controlled by them  at a time when we were not already controlled by a wto investor  would be reviewable under the investment act under two circumstances 
first  if it was an investment to acquire control within the meaning of the investment act and the value of our assets  as determined under investment act regulations  was cdn million or more 
second  the investment would also be reviewable if an order for review was made by the federal cabinet of the canadian government on the grounds that the investment related to canada s cultural heritage or national identity as prescribed under the investment act  regardless of asset value a cultural business 
currently  an investment in our common shares by a wto investor  or by a non canadian at a time when we were already controlled by a wto investor  would be reviewable under the investment act if it was an investment to acquire control and the value of our assets  as determined under investment act regulations  was not less than a specified amount  which for is cdn million 
the investment act provides detailed rules to determine if there has been an acquisition of control 
for example  a non canadian would acquire control of us for the purposes of the investment act if the non canadian acquired a majority of our outstanding common shares 
the acquisition of less than a majority  but one third or more  of our common shares would be presumed to be an acquisition of control of us unless it could be established that  on the acquisition  we were not controlled in fact by the acquirer through the ownership of common shares 
an acquisition of control for the purposes of the investment act could also occur as a result of the acquisition by a non canadian of all or substantially all of our assets 
the canadian federal government has brought forth certain amendments the amendments to the investment act 
once they come into force  the amendments would generally raise the thresholds that trigger governmental review 
specifically  with respect to wto investors  the amendments would see the thresholds for the review of direct acquisitions of control of a business which is not a cultural business increase from the current cdn million based on book value to cdn million to be based on the enterprise value of the canadian business for the two years after the amendments come into force  to cdn million in the following two years and then to cdn billion for the next two years 
thereafter  the threshold is to be adjusted to account for inflation 
the amendments will come into force when the government enacts regulations which  among other things  will provide how the enterprise value is to be determined 
the investment act also provides that the minister of industry may initiate a review of any acquisition by a non canadian of our common shares or assets if the minister considers that the acquisition could be injurious to canada s national security 
amounts that we may  in the future  pay or credit  or be deemed to have paid or credited  to shareholders as dividends in respect of the common shares held at a time when the beneficial owner is not a resident of canada within the meaning of the income tax act canada  will generally be subject to canadian non resident withholding tax of of the amount paid or credited  which may be reduced under the canada us income tax convention  as amended  the convention 
currently  under the convention  the rate of canadian non resident withholding tax on the gross amount of dividends paid or credited to a us resident that is entitled to the benefits of the convention is generally 
however  if the beneficial owner of such dividends is a us resident corporation that is entitled to the benefits of the convention and owns or more of our voting stock  the withholding rate is reduced to 
in the case of certain tax exempt entities  which are residents of the us for the purpose of the convention  the withholding tax on dividends may be reduced to

the ip b well was drilled  perforated in the hollin oil sands and steam was successfully injected into the reservoir resulting in production of heated heavy oil 
the company s initial well  ip  encountered cementing and completion problems during steam injection operations and testing at the well was suspended without recovering oil 
gas was discovered at the zitong and yixin wells drilled in the zitong block in china 
following initial flow and pressure tests  both wells have been shut in for pressure build up 
in dagang  one well was drilling at year end and five fracture stimulations were performed during in the nyalga basin of mongolia  additional d seismic was acquired and preparations were made for a further d seismic program and a drilling program

table of contents operating costs vs operating costs on a per barrel basis rose in  primarily as the result of an increase in the windfall levy administered in china due to higher realized oil prices in than in the windfall levy is imposed at progressive rates from to on the portion of the monthly weighted average sales price exceeding bbl 
higher field costs in also contributed to the increase in operating costs per barrel 
additional electrical and instrumentation costs were incurred in dagang as we installed variable frequency drives on certain producing wells to assist in reducing future maintenance and power costs 
additional transportation  oil treatment and processing expenses were also incurred  as well as higher local office costs due to increased field activity 
vs operating costs on a per barrel basis  as well as in total  decreased in from the prior year due to lower field costs as well as a reduction in the windfall levy 
field operating costs in declined from as the result of decreased road and lease maintenance and workover costs  offset by higher oil treatment costs 
once key milestones in the production sharing contract with cnpc were reached in september  we incurred a smaller proportionate share of costs in and a decline in overall working interest 
had the company paid a smaller proportionate share of costs in and the overall working interest had also been lower  field operating costs would have been bbl lower in the windfall levy expense decreased in from the prior year since oil prices realized by the company were lower in general and administrative vs general and administrative expenses g a rose in  primarily as a result of higher staff and office costs incurred with the company s growing commitments to its projects around the world 
staff and office costs increased million in across all operating segments and corporate costs  such as stock exchange filing fees and non cash stock based compensation  increased by million  which were offset by a decrease of million in contract labour 
vs in  g a rose in comparison to the prior period primarily as the result of higher costs in the corporate area and ecuador 
corporate g a rose million in over due to incurring additional legal fees see item to part i of this annual report  corporate aircraft costs and personnel costs previously allocated to our us segment 
these increases were partially offset by lower salary and benefit costs in due to the resignation of an executive in  severance paid in and reallocating certain executive salaries to the business and technology development segment 
g a for ecuador were million higher in as costs incurred prior to signing the contract to explore and develop block were minimal 
g a in china increased million for over since a lower amount of g a was allocated to capital projects in these increases were offset by a million decrease in g a incurred in canada due to capitalizing costs related to the tamarack property 
business and technology development vs business and technology development costs were higher in than in in  the ftf was used to support basic and front end engineering for a commercial scale htl plant for the tamarack project in canada and to support conceptual design for several projects  including pungarayacu in ecuador 
costs were also incurred in in connection with pursuing htl tm heavy oil and selected conventional oil opportunities in north and south america  the middle east and north africa 
vs business and technology development expenses increased in over  as a result of the startup of the ftf  opening an office in houston  the pursuit of financing initiatives in  as well as the reallocation of certain executive salaries to the business and technology development segment in late 
table of contents depletion and depreciation vs depletion and depreciation expense decreased in compared to due to lower depletion in asia and reduced depreciation in the business and technology development segment 
depletion in asia was lower due to the combination of reduced production and higher proved reserves in china 
we stopped depreciating the cdf at the end of when it was retired  lowering our depreciation expense in vs ivanhoe s depletion and depreciation expense in was lower than in depletion in asia decreased in as a result of an increase in proved reserves at our dagang project in china as well as lower production in the current year 
additionally  our depreciation expense in the business and technology development segment decreased in in comparison to the prior year as the depreciation expense associated with the ftf was lower than the depreciation expense incurred on the cdf 
foreign exchange vs the company incurred a net foreign exchange gain in in comparison to a net foreign exchange loss in the prior year 
in  the canadian dollar continued to strengthen relative to the us dollar resulting in a foreign exchange gain on the cdn million proceeds raised in our private placement in the first quarter of  partially offset by a foreign exchange loss on our canadian dollar debt 
vs we incurred a foreign exchange loss primarily due to the translation of our canadian dollar debt in and the loss was greater in than in due to the canadian dollar strengthening relative to the us dollar 
interest vs in the first quarter of  the company raised cdn million through a private placement 
the short term investment of these funds earned interest income 
interest expense in was lower than in from the repayment of loan obligations associated with the company s china and us operations during the course of vs interest expense in was lower in comparison to due to the repayment of debt 
in  we repaid a cdn million promissory note and million against our bank loan for asian operations 
impairment when the ftf was completed in  we commenced the abandonment process for the cdf 
the million net asset value of the cdf was impaired 
additionally  million of development costs related to the pursuit of projects in the middle east were impaired in in  we impaired costs associated with our gtl project due to the lack of a definitive agreement and appropriate financing 
development costs of million and intangible license costs of million were written off 
the company incurred costs associated with the pursuit of corporate financing initiatives by sunwing 
in the fourth quarter of  this financing initiative was postponed indefinitely and therefore the associated costs were written down to nil 
derivatives in  we entered into a costless collar derivative as required by the company s lenders to minimize variability in our cash flow 
this derivative had a ceiling of bbl and a floor of bbl using the wti as the index traded on the nymex 
in december  the company repaid the outstanding loan balance and this derivative was subsequently cancelled 

table of contents the derivative instrument resulted in a loss to the company in  compared to a gain in  due to movements in wti 
wti reached record highs at the beginning of the third quarter of before steadily declining at the end of the fourth quarter to a level that was the lowest dating back several years 
the low benchmark prices continued into the first half of  recovering in the last half of the year 
income taxes the company s income tax recovery was lower in than in due to a decrease in future taxes in the current year 
future taxes were significantly higher in due to the sale of the company s us oil and gas operations 
in  current income taxes included a provision for taxes in asia and a net adjustment of million related to from changes in the minimum depreciation and amortization periods for oil and gas companies by the chinese state tax administration bureau 
the future tax recovery in was driven by the sale of our us operating segment 
in  current taxes were payable on asian operations 
discontinued operations in  ivanhoe sold its wholly owned subsidiary  ivanhoe energy usa inc  disposing of all our oil and gas exploration and production operations in the us 
the us operations have been accounted for as discontinued operations on a retroactive basis in accordance with canadian gaap and the results for and have been amended accordingly 
the operating results for the discontinued operations were as follows revenue oil and gas gain on derivative instruments interest expenses operating general and administrative depletion and depreciation interest and financing income loss before disposition loss on disposition net of tax of million for  nil for net income loss from discontinued operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commitments the following information about our contractual obligations and other commitments summarizes certain liquidity and capital resource requirements 
the information presented in the table below does not include planned  but not legally committed  capital expenditures or obligations that are discretionary and or being performed under contracts which are cancelable with a day notification period 
previous exploration commitments in zitong and nyalga have been fulfilled and therefore are not included below 
total after debt interest asset retirement obligations long term obligation leases total represents undiscounted asset retirement obligations after inflation 
the discounted value million of these estimated obligations is provided for in the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents debt as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company issued a cdn million convertible promissory note maturing in july the outstanding principal amount is convertible  at talisman s option  into a maximum of  ivanhoe common shares at cdn per common share 
interest at the prime rate plus is calculated daily and payable semi annually 
the estimated interest payments on the convertible promissory note are included in the above table 
asset retirement obligations the company is required to remedy the effect of our activities on the environment at our operating sites by dismantling and removing production facilities and remediating any damage caused 
at december   we estimated the total undiscounted  inflated cost to settle our asset retirement obligations in canada  ecuador and the ftf in the us was million 
these costs are expected to be incurred between and ivanhoe does not make such a provision for asset retirement costs in connection with its oil and gas operations in china as dry holes are abandoned as occurred and the company is under no obligation to contribute to the future costs to restore well sites or abandon the field 
long term obligation as part of its merger with ensyn  the company assumed an obligation to pay million in the event that proceeds from the sale of units incorporating the htl technology for petroleum applications reach a total of million 
operating leases we have long term operating leases for office space  which expire between january and september other from time to time  ivanhoe enters into consulting agreements whereby a success fee may be payable if and when either a definitive agreement is signed or certain other contractual milestones are met 
under the agreements  the consultant may receive cash  common shares  stock options or some combination thereof 
these fees are not considered to be material 
the company may provide indemnities to third parties  in the ordinary course of business  that are customary in certain commercial transactions  such as purchase and sale agreements 
the terms of these indemnities will vary based upon the contract  the nature of which prevents ivanhoe from making a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amounts that may be required to be paid 
the company s management is of the opinion that any resulting settlements relating to indemnities are immaterial 
in the normal course of business  we are subject to legal proceedings being brought against us 
while the final outcome of these proceedings is uncertain  we believe that these proceedings  in the aggregate  are not reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
sources and uses of cash the following table sets forth a summary of our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reported in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities operating activities vs operating activities in used more cash than in primarily as a result of lower oil revenue and higher g a costs  partially offset by current tax savings 
operating activities benefitted from net cash from discontinued operations 
an increase in accounts payable  partially offset by changes in accounts receivable and income taxes  represented working capital cash in flows from operating activities in compared to an overall working capital outflow in 
table of contents vs operating activities in resulted in a use of cash due to significantly lower revenue in  in contrast to activities which generated cash inflows 
investing activities vs net cash used for investing activities was higher in than in due to a more extensive capital program 
payables related to capital expenditures were higher at december   than the prior year  creating a source of working capital 
in  million cash was generated from the sale of our us operating segment 
vs in  investing activities resulted in a net cash inflow due to the sale of the us operating segment 
in comparison  million was paid to acquire the tamarack leases in  and when combined with other capital expenditures  created a net cash outflow in financing activities vs in  financing activities raised million of cash with the private placement of million special warrants in february and march at a price of cdn per special warrant 
additional cash was raised through the exercise of stock options 
the repayment of debt in resulted in a net cash outflow from financing activities 
vs financing activities in resulted in a net cash outflow due to the final debt repayment of long term notes and the repayment of a note associated with discontinued operations 
in  financing activities resulted in a net cash inflow due to a private placement in the third quarter and the receipt of cash from a cdn million loan 
capital structure as at december  cash and cash equivalents debt long term debt shareholders equity ivanhoe intends to use its cash and cash equivalent balance to fulfill its commitments and partially fund operations in cash flow from operating activities may be insufficient to meet operating requirements in the next months and additional sources of funding  either at a parent company level or at a project level  will be required to grow the company s major projects and fully develop its oil and gas properties 
historically  ivanhoe has used external sources of funding  such as public and private equity and debt markets 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all  and any future equity issuances may be dilutive to our current investors 
if we cannot secure additional financing  we may have to delay our capital programs and forfeit or dilute our rights in existing oil and gas property interests 
critical accounting principles and estimates our significant accounting policies may be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
some of these policies involve critical accounting estimates because they require us to make particularly subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following section discusses our critical accounting estimates and assumptions and how they affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of reserves is inherently uncertain and complex 
it requires significant judgment and decisions based on available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
these estimates may change substantially as additional data from ongoing development activities and production becomes available and as economic conditions impacting oil and gas prices and costs change 
such revisions could be upwards or downwards 
for details on our reserve estimation process  refer to the section titled reserves  production and related information in items and of this annual report 
reserve estimates have a material impact on depletion and the company s impairment evaluations  which in turn have a material impact on the results of operations 
total proved reserves estimates are used to determine rates that are applied to each barrel of production in calculating our depletion expense 
in  depletion expense of million was recorded 
if our proved reserves estimates changed by  our depletion and depreciation expense would have changed by approximately million  assuming all other variables remained constant 
impairment oil and gas properties and development costs we periodically evaluate our oil and gas properties and development costs for impairment 
among other things  an impairment of these assets may be triggered by falling oil and gas prices  a significant negative revision to our reserve estimates  the inability to use our htl technology in certain projects  changes in capital costs or the inability to raise sufficient financial resources to further develop the property 
if one of these occurs  we assess if the undiscounted future net cash flows from proved reserves at future commodity prices plus the cost of undeveloped properties is less than the carrying value of the capitalized costs 
if an impairment is found to exist  the impaired properties are written down to their fair value 
the fair value of the assets is calculated based on future net cash flows from proved plus probable reserves  discounted at a risk free interest rate using future commodity prices  plus the cost of undeveloped properties 
cash flow estimates for our impairment assessments require assumptions about future prices and costs  reserves  discount rates and potential benefits from the application of our htl technology 
given the significant assumptions required and the likelihood that actual conditions will differ  we consider the assessment of impairment to be a critical accounting estimate 
it is difficult to determine and assess how a decrease in proved reserves could impact our impairment tests 
the relationship between our reserve estimates and the estimated undiscounted cash flows and the nature of the property by property impairment test is complex 
as a result  we are unable to provide a reasonable sensitivity analysis of the impact that a reserve estimate decrease would have on our assessment of impairment 
intangible assets intangible assets consist of an exclusive  irrevocable license to deploy htl technology our proprietary  patented heavy oil upgrading process 
we periodically review the intangible assets for impairment or if an adverse event or change occurs 
indicators of adverse events could include htl patent expiries  advancements of new technologies or the inability to successfully commercialize the htl technology 
to determine if the intangible assets are impaired  we assess if the undiscounted future cash flows are in excess of the carrying value 
if not  the assets are reduced to their fair value based on expected discounted future cash flows 
we believe that the intangible asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it requires management to make assumptions about competitive technological developments  the successful commercialization of our htl technology and future cash flows from the htl technology 
we cannot predict if an event that triggers impairment will occur  when it will occur or how it will affect the asset amounts we have reported 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable and consistent with current conditions  internal planning and expected future operations  such estimates are subject to significant uncertainties and judgments 
future income taxes we operate in a specialized industry and in several tax jurisdictions 
as a result  our income is subject to various rates of taxation 
the breadth of the company s operations and the global complexity of tax regulations require assessments of uncertainties and judgments in estimating the taxes we will ultimately pay 
the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions  uncertain tax positions and resolution of disputes arising from federal  provincial  state and local tax audits 
the resolution of these uncertainties and the associated final taxes may result in adjustments to our tax assets and tax liabilities 
we estimate future income taxes based upon temporary differences between the assets and liabilities that we report in our consolidated financial statements and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities as determined under applicable tax laws 
we record a valuation allowance against our future income tax assets when we believe  based on all available evidence  that it is not more likely than not that all of our future income tax assets recognized will be realized 
the amount of the future income tax asset recognized and considered realizable could  however  be reduced if projected income is not achieved 

table of contents convertible note liability in connection with the acquisition of the tamarack leases in july from talisman  we issued a convertible note 
the convertible note is a compound financial instrument  containing a debt instrument as well as an embedded conversion feature classified as equity 
the residual basis method was used to value the instrument which means the fair value of the liability component was calculated and the remaining value was assigned to the equity component 
management estimated the value of the liability component to be cdn million by discounting the expected interest and principal payments 
the remaining value of cdn million was allocated to the equity component 
if the interest rate used to discount the liability decreased by  the amount of the convertible note originally recorded as a liability would increase by million and the equity component would have been million lower 
since the accretion of the liability component over the three year maturity period is capitalized on the balance sheet  there would not have been an impact on our operating results 
increasing the interest rate by would have had the opposite  but equal  impact on our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements transition to international financial reporting standards effective january   we adopted international financial reporting standards ifrs as our basis for accounting 
most adjustments required on transition to ifrs were made retrospectively against opening retained earnings as of the date of the first comparative balance sheet 
transitional adjustments relating to those standards where comparative figures are not required to be restated will only be made as of the first day of the year of adoption 
as a foreign private issuer in the us  we will be permitted to file with the sec consolidated financial statements prepared under ifrs without a reconciliation to us gaap 
the impact of this change is that we will no longer prepare a reconciliation of our results to us gaap 
it is possible that some of our accounting policies under ifrs could be different from us gaap 
first time adoption of international financial reporting standards first time adoption of international financial reporting standards ifrs provides companies adopting ifrs for the first time with a number of optional exemptions and mandatory exceptions to the general requirement for full retrospective application of ifrs where retrospective restatement would either be onerous or would not provide more useful information 
as a result of relying upon the exemptions described below  there was no material impact in these areas at the date of transition to ifrs 

table of contents area of ifrs summary of exemption available property  plant and equipment companies may elect to report property  plant and equipment from oil and gas operations on the opening balance sheet on the transition date at a deemed cost  instead of the actual cost  as though ifrs had been adopted retroactively 
the deemed cost of an item may be either its fair value at the date of transition to ifrs or an amount reported under canadian gaap 
the exemption can be applied on an asset by asset basis 
ivanhoe elected to report property  plant and equipment from oil and gas operations in its opening balance sheet on the transition date at the deemed cost previously calculated under canadian gaap 
decommissioning liabilities in accounting for changes in decommissioning liabilities  ifrs requires changes in such obligations to be added to  or deducted from  the cost of the asset to which they relate 
the adjusted depreciable amount of the asset is then depreciated prospectively over its remaining useful life 
rather than recalculating the effect of all such changes throughout the life of the obligation  companies may elect to measure the liability and the related depreciation effects at the date of transition to ifrs 
ivanhoe elected to measure only those decommissioning liabilities outstanding from our ftf on the date of transition to ifrs 
stock based compensation companies may elect not to apply ifrs  share based payment  to stock options granted on or before november   or which vested before the date of transition to ifrs 
ivanhoe elected to utilize this exemption for the all stock options awarded after november   that vested before january  business combinations companies may elect to either restate all past business combinations in accordance with ifrs  business combinations  or to apply an elective exemption from applying ifrs to past business combinations ivanhoe has elected to utilize this exemption such that transactions entered into prior to the transition date will not be restated 
expected areas of significance ifrs will have a significant impact on the company s ongoing accounting in the areas described below  in addition to the impact of transition policy choices made under ifrs accounting policy area impact of policy adoption exploration and evaluation assets the company followed the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas operations under canadian cdn gaap  whereby all costs related to the exploration for  and development of  oil and gas reserves were capitalized and periodically evaluated for impairment 
under ifrs  exploration costs will initially be capitalized as exploration and evaluation e e assets until it can be determined if sufficient quantities of reserves have been found to justify commercial production 
if commercial quantities of reserves are found  e e assets will be reclassified to oil and gas properties and development costs and  if not  e e assets will be expensed on the consolidated income statement 
costs incurred in connection with our projects in canada  ecuador  mongolia and exploration projects in china will be reclassified as e e assets  while producing assets in china will continue to be classified as oil and gas properties and development costs on the consolidated balance sheet 
impairments cdn gaap generally used a two step approach to impairment testing first comparing asset carrying values with undiscounted future cash flows to determine whether impairment exists and then measuring any impairment by comparing asset carrying values with fair values calculated using discounted cash flows 
international accounting standard  impairment of assets  uses a one step approach for both testing and measuring of impairment  with asset carrying values compared directly with the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use which uses discounted future cash flows 
this may potentially result in more write downs where carrying values of assets were previously supported under cdn gaap on an undiscounted cash flow basis  but could not be supported on a discounted cash flow basis 
ifrs also requires the reversal of any previous impairment losses where circumstances have changed such that impairments have been reduced 
cdn gaap prohibits the reversal of impairment losses 
ifrs will result in greater variability in our operating results and asset carrying values 
capitalized g a g a directly related to exploration and development activities were capitalized as oil and gas properties and development costs under cdn gaap 
the threshold to capitalize g a is higher under ifrs  therefore  we expect to capitalize less g a in the future and g a on the consolidated income statement will be higher as a result 
financial instruments under cdn gaap  the equity component of the company s convertible note and the common share purchase warrants were classified as shareholders equity 
in accordance with ias  financial instruments presentation  financial instruments with an exercise price denominated in a currency other than our functional currency are accounted for as derivatives 
since our convertible note and common share purchase warrants are denominated in cdn dollars and our functional currency is us dollars  these items were reclassified from shareholders equity to liabilities under ifrs 
additionally  ifrs requires derivative instruments to be recorded at fair value with changes in their fair value recognized in the income statement 
this will create variability in our results of operations and the carrying value of liabilities 
stock based compensation stock options were accounted for using the fair value method under canadian gaap 
the fair value was determined using the black scholes option pricing model and recorded as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the period that the stock options vested 
under ifrs  share based payment  compensation expense will be charged to earnings on a graded vesting basis 
this will accelerate the compensation expense recognized on the consolidated income statement in comparison to cdn gaap 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed in varying degrees to normal market risks inherent in the oil and gas industry  including commodity price risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  credit risk and liquidity risk 
we recognize these risks and manage our operations to minimize our exposures to the extent practicable 
commodity price risk commodity price risk related to oil prices is one of ivanhoe s most significant market risk exposures 
the company s operating results and financial condition are influenced by the prices we receive for our oil production 
oil prices may fluctuate widely in response to a variety of factors including global and domestic economic conditions  weather conditions  political stability  transportation facilities  the price and availability of alternative fuels and government regulations 
based on our estimated production  a us bbl change in the price of oil would increase or decrease net income and cash flows from operations for by us bbl 
in the past  we have used derivatives to minimize variability in our cash flow from operations when required to do so by loan covenants 
however  no hedging contracts were in place in nor do we anticipate using hedging contracts in to manage our commodity price risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk ivanhoe is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk as a result of incurring capital expenditures and operating costs in currencies other than the us dollar 
a substantial portion of our activities are transacted in or referenced to us dollars  including oil sales in asia  capital spending in ecuador and ongoing ftf operations 
a portion of our transactions are in other currencies  such as dagang operating costs paid in chinese renminbi  tamarack exploration activities funded in cdn dollars and the common share issuance in cdn dollars 
the company did not enter into any foreign currency derivatives in  nor do we anticipate using foreign currency derivatives in to help reduce the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  it seeks to hold assets and liabilities denominated in the same currency when appropriate 
the following table shows the company s exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk on its net loss and comprehensive loss  assuming reasonably possible changes in the relevant foreign currency 
this analysis assumes all other variables remain constant 
increase decrease increase decrease in net loss and comprehensive loss or weakening or strengthening chinese renminbi canadian dollar credit risk ivanhoe is exposed to credit risk with respect to its cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  note receivable  restricted cash and long term receivables 
the company s maximum exposure to credit risk at december   is represented by the carrying amount of these non derivative financial assets 
most of the company s credit exposures are with counterparties in the energy industry and are therefore exposed to normal industry credit risks 
ivanhoe manages its credit risk by only entering into sales contracts with established entities 
the company believes its exposure to credit risk related to cash and cash equivalents  as well as restricted cash  is minimal due to the quality of the financial institutions where the funds are held and the nature of the deposit instruments 
currently  all of the company s oil production is sold to one national oil corporation 
as a result  of the outstanding accounts receivable balance at december  december  is due from a national oil corporation 
long term value added tax receivable from ecuador will be recoverable upon commencement of commercial operations 
ivanhoe considers the risk of default on these items to be low due to the company s ongoing operations in china and ecuador 

table of contents liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that suitable sources of funding for the company s business activities may not be available 
since cash flows from existing operations are insufficient to fund future capital expenditures  we intend to finance future capital projects with a combination of strategic investors and or public and private debt and equity markets  either at a parent company level or at the project level or from the sale of existing assets 
there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such financing on favorable terms  if at all 
non gaap financial measures oil revenue per barrel is calculated by dividing oil revenue by the company s total production for the respective periods presented 
net operating revenue per barrel is calculated by dividing oil revenue less operating costs by total production for the respective periods presented 
net revenue loss from operations per barrel is calculated by subtracting depletion from net operating revenue and dividing by total production for the respective periods presented 
the company believes oil revenue per barrel  net operating revenue per barrel and net revenue loss from operations per barrel are important to investors to evaluate operating results and the company s ability to generate cash 
each of the components used in these calculations can be reconciled directly to the consolidated statement of loss and comprehensive loss 
the calculations of oil revenue per barrel  net operating revenue per barrel and net revenue loss from operations per barrel may differ from similar calculations of other companies in the oil and gas industry  thereby limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure
