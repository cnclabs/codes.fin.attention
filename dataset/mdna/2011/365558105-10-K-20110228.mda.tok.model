table of contents environmental matters the company is subject to numerous federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the storage  handling  emission  disposal and discharge of materials into the environment 
the company believes that its existing environmental control procedures are adequate and it has no current plans for substantial capital expenditures in this area 
gardner denver has an environmental policy that confirms its commitment to a clean environment and compliance with environmental laws 
gardner denver has an active environmental management program aimed at compliance with existing environmental regulations and developing methods to eliminate or significantly reduce the generation of pollutants in the manufacturing processes 
the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under us federal superfund or similar state laws that impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages 
persons potentially liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites 
although these laws impose joint and several liability  in application  the prps typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon the volume of waste contributed by each prp 
based on currently available information  gardner denver was only a small contributor to these waste sites  and the company has  or is attempting to negotiate  de minimis settlements for their cleanup 
the cleanup of the remaining sites is substantially complete and the company s future obligations entail a share of the sites ongoing operating and maintenance expense 
the company is also addressing three on site cleanups for which it is the primary responsible party 
two of these cleanup sites are in the operation and maintenance stage and the third is in the implementation stage 
based on currently available information  the company does not anticipate that any of these sites will result in material additional costs beyond those already accrued on its balance sheet 
gardner denver has an accrued liability on its balance sheet to the extent costs are known or can be reasonably estimated for its remaining financial obligations for these matters

item a 
risk factors we have exposure to the risks associated with future global economic down turns  which may negatively impact our revenues  liquidity  suppliers and customers 
as a result of the adverse economic conditions in the united states  europe and asia  we experienced decreased demand for our products during  which in turn had a negative effect on our revenues and net income 
the economic recovery in certain markets during resulted in improved revenues and net income in however  continued future growth will  in part  be contingent on the strength and duration of the recovery 
additionally  diminished credit availability may prohibit our customers and suppliers from obtaining financing for their operations  which could result in i disruption to our supply deliveries or our inability to obtain raw materials at favorable pricing  ii a decrease in orders of our products or the cancellations thereof  and iii our customers inability to pay for our products 
furthermore  the volatility in security prices may adversely affect the value of the assets in our pension plans  which may  in turn  result in increased future funding requirements and pension cost 
we are unable to predict the strength and duration of the current economic recovery in the united states  europe and 
table of contents asia 
a return to the more adverse economic conditions experienced in could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and exacerbate the other risk factors described below 
we operate in cyclical markets  which may make our revenues and operating results fluctuate 
demand for certain of our petroleum products is primarily tied to the number of working and available drilling rigs and oil and natural gas prices 
the energy market  in particular  is cyclical in nature as the worldwide demand for oil and natural gas fluctuates 
when worldwide demand for these commodities is depressed  the demand for our products used in drilling and recovery applications is reduced 
accordingly  our operating results for any particular period are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period as the markets for our products have historically experienced cyclical downturns in demand 
we face robust competition in the markets we serve  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we actively compete with many companies producing the same or similar products 
depending on the particular product and application  we experience competition based on a number of factors  including price  quality  performance and availability 
we compete against many companies  including divisions of larger companies with greater financial resources than we possess 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand a change in conditions within the markets in which we compete and throughout the economy as a whole 
in addition  new competitors could enter our markets 
if we cannot compete successfully  our sales and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
large or rapid increases in the costs of raw materials or substantial decreases in their availability and our dependence on particular suppliers of raw materials could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our primary raw materials  directly and indirectly  are cast iron  aluminum and steel 
we also purchase a large number of motors and  therefore  also have exposure to changes in the price of copper  which is a primary component of motors 
the company has long term contracts with only a few suppliers of key components 
consequently  we are vulnerable to fluctuations in prices of such raw materials 
factors such as supply and demand  freight costs and transportation availability  inventory levels of brokers and dealers  the level of imports and general economic conditions may affect the price of raw materials 
we use single sources of supply for certain iron castings  motors and other select engineered components 
from time to time in recent years  we have experienced a disruption to our supply deliveries and may experience further supply disruptions 
any such disruption could have a material adverse effect on our ability to timely meet our commitments to customers and  therefore  our operating results 
more than half of our sales and operations are in non us jurisdictions and is subject to the economic  political  regulatory and other risks of international operations 
for the fiscal year ended december   approximately of our revenues were from customers in countries outside of the united states 
we have manufacturing facilities in germany  the uk  china  finland  italy  brazil  sweden and canada 
we intend to continue to expand our international operations to the extent that suitable opportunities become available 
non us operations and non us export sales could be adversely affected as a result of political or economic instability in certain countries  differences in foreign laws  including increased difficulties in protecting intellectual property and uncertainty in enforcement of contract rights  credit risks  
table of contents currency fluctuations  in particular  changes in currency exchange rates between the usd  the eur  the gbp and the cny  exchange controls  changes in tariff restrictions  royalty and tax increases  potential problems obtaining supply of raw materials  nationalization of private enterprises  shipping products during times of crisis or war  and other factors inherent in foreign operations 
our operating results could be adversely affected by a reduction of business with key customers for petroleum products 
although we have no customers that individually represent or more of our total annual sales  we derive revenue from certain key customers for our petroleum products and the loss or reduction of any significant contracts with any of these customers could result in a material decrease of our future profitability and cash flows 
in addition  lost sales may be difficult to replace due to the relative concentration of the customer base in this market segment 
the nature of our products creates the possibility of significant product liability and warranty claims  which could harm our business 
customers use some of our products in potentially hazardous applications that can cause injury or loss of life and damage to property  equipment or the environment 
in addition  our products are integral to the production process for some end users and any failure of our products could result in a suspension of operations 
although we maintain strict quality controls and procedures  we cannot be certain that our products will be completely free from defects 
we maintain amounts and types of insurance coverage that we believe are currently adequate and consistent with normal industry practice for a company of our relative size  and limit our liability by contract wherever possible 
however  we cannot guarantee that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all liabilities incurred 
we also may not be able to maintain insurance in the future at levels we believe are necessary and at rates we consider reasonable 
we may be named as a defendant in product liability or other lawsuits asserting potentially large claims if an accident occurs at a location where our equipment and services have been or are being used 
we may not fully realize the expected financial benefits from future restructuring actions 
future restructuring actions may not be as effective as we anticipate  and we may fail to realize the expected cost savings we anticipated from these actions 
our success depends on our executive management and other key personnel 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of our executive management and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers could have an adverse impact 
the availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is robust 
however  we provide long term equity incentives and certain other benefits for our executive officers which provide incentives for them to make a long term commitment to our company 
our future success will also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and a failure to attract and retain new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on our operations 

table of contents communication or information systems failure may disrupt our business and result in financial loss and liability to our customers 
our business is highly dependent on financial  accounting and other data processing systems and other communications and information systems  including our enterprise resource planning tools 
we process a large number of transactions on a daily basis and rely upon the proper functioning of computer systems 
if any of these systems fail  whether caused by fire  other natural disaster  power or telecommunications failure  acts of terrorism or war or otherwise  or they do not function correctly  we could suffer financial loss  business disruption  liability to our customers  regulatory intervention or damage to our reputation 
if our systems are unable to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions  our ability to grow could be limited 
although we have back up systems  procedures and capabilities in place  they may also fail or be inadequate 
our business could suffer if we experience employee work stoppages or other labor difficulties 
as of january  we have approximately  full time employees 
a significant number of our employees  including a large portion of the employees outside of the us  are represented by works councils and labor unions 
although we do not anticipate future work stoppages by our union employees  work stoppages may occur 
although we believe that our relations with employees are satisfactory and have not experienced any material work stoppages  we may not be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements 
additionally  future negotiations with our union employees may i result in significant increases in our cost of labor  ii divert management s attention away from operating our business or iii breakdown and result in the disruption of our operations 
the occurrence of any of the preceding conditions could impair our ability to manufacture our products and result in increased costs and or decreased operating results 
the risk of potential changes in shale oil and gas regulation 
potential changes in the regulation of shale oil and gas exploration and extraction could negatively affect our ability to develop products for this market and our customer s demand for our products 
we are a defendant in certain asbestos and silica personal injury lawsuits  which could adversely affect our financial condition 
we have been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos and silica personal injury lawsuits 
the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources  and typically we are one of approximately or more named defendants 
in our experience to date  the substantial majority of the plaintiffs have not suffered an injury for which we bear responsibility 
we believe that the pending lawsuits are not likely to  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
however  future developments  including  without limitation  potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants  an adverse determination in the adams county case as defined in contingencies contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this annual report on form k or other inability to collect from the company s historical insurers or indemnitors  could cause a different outcome 
accordingly  the resolution of pending or future lawsuits may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the risk of non compliance with us and foreign laws and regulations applicable to our international operations could have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial condition or strategic objectives 
our global operations subject us to regulation by us federal and state laws and multiple foreign laws  regulations and policies  which could result in conflicting legal requirements 
these laws and regulations are complex  change frequently  have tended to become more stringent over time and increase our cost of doing business 
these laws and regulations include import and export control  environmental  health and safety regulations  data privacy 
table of contents requirements  international labor laws and work councils and anti corruption and bribery laws such as the us foreign corrupt practices act  the un convention against bribery and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials 
we are subject to the risk that we  our employees  our affiliated entities  contractors  agents or their respective officers  directors  employees and agents may take actions determined to be in violation of any of these laws  particularly as we expand our operations geographically through organic growth and acquisitions 
an actual or alleged violation could result in substantial fines  sanctions  civil or criminal penalties  debarment from government contracts  curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions  competitive or reputational harm  litigation or regulatory action and other consequences that might adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition or strategic objectives 
environmental compliance costs and liabilities could adversely affect our financial condition 
our operations and properties are subject to increasingly stringent domestic and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental protection  including laws and regulations governing air emissions  water discharges  waste management and workplace safety 
under such laws and regulations  we can be subject to substantial fines and sanctions for violations and be required to install costly pollution control equipment or effect operational changes to limit pollution emissions or decrease the likelihood of accidental hazardous substance releases 
we must conform our operations and properties to these laws and regulations 
we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our manufacturing operations 
in addition  many of our current and former properties are  or have been  used for industrial purposes 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under us federal superfund or similar state laws 
an accrued liability on our balance sheet reflects costs that are probable and estimable for our projected financial obligations relating to these matters 
if we have underestimated our remaining financial obligations  we may face greater exposure that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
stringent fines and penalties may be imposed for non compliance with regulatory requirements relating to environmental matters  and many environmental laws impose joint and several liability for remediation for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  operating costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination  or the imposition of new cleanup requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
climate change is receiving ever increasing attention worldwide 
certain scientists  legislators and others attribute global warning to increased levels of greenhouse gases  including carbon dioxide  which has led to legislative and regulatory efforts in some jurisdictions to limit greenhouse gas emissions 
based on existing regulations and international accords in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business  the costs associated with compliance with such regulations are not material to our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
because we are uncertain what laws  regulations and accords may be enacted in the future  we cannot predict the potential impact of any such future laws  and any such future laws  regulations and accords may have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property or may claim we have infringed their intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing or defending our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  confidentiality provisions  contractual restrictions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce these intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
although we make a significant effort to avoid infringing known proprietary rights of third parties  from time to time we may receive 
table of contents notice that a third party believes that our products may be infringing certain patents  trademarks or other proprietary rights of such third party 
responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  can be costly and time consuming  and can divert management s attention and other resources 
depending on the resolution of such claims  we may be barred from using a specific technology or other right  may be required to redesign or re engineer a product  or may become liable for significant damages 
a significant portion of our assets consists of goodwill and other intangible assets  the value of which may be reduced if we determine that those assets are impaired 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
impairment assessment under gaap requires that we consider  among other factors  differences between the current book value and estimated fair value of our net assets  and comparison of the estimated fair value of our net assets to our current market capitalization 
as of december   the net carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately million  or of our total assets 
in  we recorded impairment charges totaling million to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill in the industrial products group and a million impairment charge primarily to reduce the carrying value of a trade name in the industrial products group 
based on our annual impairment testing conducted in  and a review of any potential indicators of impairment  we concluded that the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets were not further impaired 
if goodwill or other assets are further impaired based on a future impairment test  we could be required to record additional non cash impairment charges to our operating income 
such non cash impairment charges  if significant  could materially and adversely affect our results of operations in the period recognized  reduce our consolidated stockholders equity and increase our debt to total capitalization ratio  which could negatively impact our credit rating and access to public debt and equity markets 
our indebtedness could adversely affect our financial flexibility 
we had debt of million at december   and our indebtedness could have an adverse future effect on our business 
for example borrowings under the credit agreement bear interest at floating rates  which could result in higher interest expense in the event of an increase in interest rates  we may have a limited ability to borrow additional amounts for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  debt service requirements  restructuring costs  execution of our growth strategy  or other purposes  a portion of our cash flow will be used to pay principal and interest on our debt  which will reduce the funds available for working capital  capital expenditures  selective acquisitions  payment of cash dividends and other purposes  we may be more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  and the various covenants contained in our credit agreement  the indenture covering the senior subordinated notes  and the documents governing our other existing indebtedness may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to some of our competitors 
we may not be able to continue to identify and complete strategic acquisitions and effectively integrate acquired companies to achieve desired financial benefits 
we have completed acquisitions since becoming an independent company in we expect to continue making acquisitions if appropriate opportunities arise 
however  we may not be able to identify and successfully 
table of contents negotiate suitable strategic acquisitions  obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms or otherwise complete future acquisitions 
furthermore  our existing operations may encounter unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial and managerial resources  which would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
even if we can complete future acquisitions  we face significant challenges in consolidating functions and effectively integrating procedures  personnel  product lines  and operations in a timely and efficient manner 
the integration process can be complex and time consuming  may be disruptive to our existing and acquired businesses  and may cause an interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  those businesses 
even if we can successfully complete the integration of acquired businesses into our operations  any anticipated cost savings  synergies  or revenue enhancements may not be realized within the expected time frame  or at all 
we face risks associated with our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
we have both funded and unfunded pension and other postretirement benefit plans worldwide 
as of december   our projected benefit obligations under our pension and other postretirement benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by an aggregate of approximately million unfunded status  compared to million at december  estimates for the amount and timing of the future funding obligations of these benefit plans are based on various assumptions 
these assumptions include discount rates  rates of compensation increases  expected long term rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare cost trend rates 
if our assumptions prove incorrect  our funding obligations may increase  which may have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
we have invested the plan assets of our funded benefit plans in various equity and debt securities 
a deterioration in the value of plan assets could cause the unfunded status of these benefit plans to increase  thereby increasing our obligation to make additional contributions to these plans 
an obligation to make contributions to our benefit plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses  and may have an adverse impact on our operations  financial condition and liquidity

outlook in general  the company believes that demand for products in its industrial products group tends to correlate with the rate of total industrial capacity utilization and the rate of change of industrial production because compressed air is often used as a fourth utility in the manufacturing process 
capacity utilization rates above have historically indicated a good demand environment for industrial equipment such as compressor and vacuum products 
over longer time periods  the company believes that demand also tends to follow economic growth patterns indicated by the rates of change in the gross domestic product around the world 
the significant contraction in manufacturing capacity utilization in the us and europe  which began in  has resulted in lower demand for capital equipment  such as compressor packages  as existing equipment remained idle 
the company believes there have been recent improvements in global capacity utilization rates  which indicate a more positive environment for aftermarket parts and services and replacement opportunities for industrial compressors  but that the improvements have not been sufficient to warrant significant capital investments by manufacturing companies in the us and europe

order backlog for the industrial products group was higher in most geographic regions as of december  compared to december  orders in the engineered products group increased to million in  compared to million in  due to accelerating demand for drilling and well servicing pumps  and strong demand for engineered packages for infrastructure investments  loading arms and oem products million  or and the acquisition of ilmvac million  or  partially offset by the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates million 
order backlog for the engineered products group increased to million as of december  from million at december  due primarily to the growth in orders as discussed above million  or and the acquisition of ilmvac million  or  partially offset by the unfavorable effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates million  or 
orders for products in the engineered products group have historically corresponded to demand for petrochemical products and been influenced by prices for oil and natural gas  and rig count  among other factors  which the company cannot predict 
revenues for engineered products depend more on existing backlog levels than revenues for industrial products 
many of these products are used in process applications  such as oil and gas refining and chemical processing  which are industries that typically experience increased demand very late in economic cycles 
order backlog consists of orders believed to be firm for which a customer purchase order has been received or communicated 
however  since orders may be rescheduled or canceled  order backlog is not necessarily indicative of future revenue levels 
during  and  the company completed cost reduction and restructuring initiatives in connection with the integration of compair  which was acquired in the fourth quarter of  and to mitigate  to the greatest extent possible  the significant decline in global demand and eliminate excess capacity that resulted from operational improvements

in  the company began to realize the improved manufacturing flexibility  lead time  and operating margins resulting from these initiatives  and expects that the full impact of these benefits will be realized beginning in the company expects gradual improvements in capacity utilization to drive demand for its industrial products and services  including some replacement opportunities for industrial compressors and blowers

purchase obligations consist primarily of agreements to purchase inventory or services made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated as of december  for this reason  these amounts will not provide a complete and reliable indicator of the company s expected future cash outflows 
total pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities recognized on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  were million and represented the unfunded status of the company s defined benefit plans at the end of total pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities were million at december  the total pension and other postretirement benefit liability is included in the consolidated balance sheet line items accrued liabilities  postretirement benefits other than pensions and other liabilities 
because this liability is impacted by  among other items  plan funding levels  changes in plan demographics and assumptions  and investment return on plan assets  it does not represent expected liquidity needs 
accordingly  the company did not include this liability in the contractual cash obligations table 
the company funds its us qualified pension plans in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of regulations for the minimum annual required contribution and internal revenue service regulations for the maximum annual allowable tax deduction 
the company is committed to making the required minimum contributions and expects to contribute a total of approximately million to its us qualified pension plans during furthermore  the company expects to contribute a total of approximately million to its postretirement health care benefit plans during future contributions are dependent upon various factors including the performance of the plan assets  benefit payment experience and changes  if any  to current funding requirements 
therefore  no amounts were included in the contractual cash obligations table 
the company generally expects to fund all future contributions with cash flows from operating activities 
the company s non us pension plans are funded in accordance with local laws and income tax regulations 
the company expects to contribute a total of approximately million to its non us qualified pension plans during no amounts have been included in the contractual cash obligations table due to the same reasons noted above 
disclosure of amounts in the contractual cash obligations table regarding expected benefit payments in future years for the company s pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans cannot be properly reflected due to the ongoing nature of the obligations of these plans 
the company currently anticipates the annual benefit payments for the us plans to be in the range of approximately million to million in and to gradually decrease to an annual level of approximately million for the next several years  and the annual benefit payments for the non us plans to be in the range of approximately million to million in and to gradually increase to an annual level in the range of million to million for the next several years 
as of december   the company had approximately million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions 
these unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual cash obligations table due to uncertainty as to the amounts and timing of settlement with taxing authorities 
net deferred income tax liabilities were million as of december  this amount is not included in the contractual cash obligations table because the company believes this presentation would not be meaningful 
net deferred income tax liabilities are calculated based on temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their book basis  which will result in taxable amounts in future years when the book basis is settled 
the results of these calculations do not have a direct connection with the amount of cash taxes to be paid in any future periods 
in the normal course of business  the company or its subsidiaries may sometimes be required to provide surety bonds  standby letters of credit or similar instruments to guarantee its performance of contractual or legal obligations 
as of december   the company had million in such instruments outstanding and had pledged million of cash to the issuing financial institutions as collateral for such instruments 

table of contents contingencies the company is a party to various legal proceedings  lawsuits and administrative actions  which are of an ordinary or routine nature for a company of its size and sector 
in addition  due to the bankruptcies of several asbestos manufacturers and other primary defendants  among other things  the company has been named as a defendant in a number of asbestos personal injury lawsuits 
the company has also been named as a defendant in a number of silica personal injury lawsuits 
the plaintiffs in these suits allege exposure to asbestos or silica from multiple sources and typically the company is one of approximately or more named defendants 
in the company s experience to date  the substantial majority of the plaintiffs have not suffered an injury for which the company bears responsibility 
predecessors to the company sometimes manufactured  distributed and or sold products allegedly at issue in the pending asbestos and silica litigation lawsuits the products 
however  neither the company nor its predecessors ever mined  manufactured  mixed  produced or distributed asbestos fiber or silica sand  the materials that allegedly caused the injury underlying the lawsuits 
moreover  the asbestos containing components of the products  if any  were enclosed within the subject products 
the company has entered into a series of agreements with certain of its or its predecessors legacy insurers and certain potential indemnitors to secure insurance coverage and or reimbursement for the costs associated with the asbestos and silica lawsuits filed against the company 
the company has also pursued litigation against certain insurers or indemnitors where necessary 
the latest of these actions  gardner denver  inc v 
certain underwriters at lloyd s  london  et al  was filed on july   in the eighth judicial district  adams county  illinois  as case number l the adams county case 
in the lawsuit  the company seeks  among other things  to require certain excess insurer defendants to honor their insurance policy obligations to the company  including payment in whole or in part of the costs associated with the asbestos lawsuits filed against the company 
the company believes that the pending and future asbestos and silica lawsuits are not likely to  in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  based on the company s anticipated insurance and indemnification rights to address the risks of such matters  the limited potential asbestos exposure from the products described above  the company s experience that the vast majority of plaintiffs are not impaired with a disease attributable to alleged exposure to asbestos or silica from or relating to the products or for which the company otherwise bears responsibility  various potential defenses available to the company with respect to such matters  and the company s prior disposition of comparable matters 
however  due to inherent uncertainties of litigation and because future developments  including  without limitation  potential insolvencies of insurance companies or other defendants  an adverse determination in the adams county case  or other inability to collect from the company s historical insurers or indemnitors  could cause a different outcome  there can be no assurance that the resolution of pending or future lawsuits will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company has been identified as a potentially responsible party prp with respect to several sites designated for cleanup under us federal superfund or similar state laws that impose liability for cleanup of certain waste sites and for related natural resource damages 
persons potentially liable for such costs and damages generally include the site owner or operator and persons that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances found at those sites 
although these laws impose joint and several liability  in application  the prps typically allocate the investigation and cleanup costs based upon the volume of waste contributed by each prp 
based on currently available information  the company was only a small contributor to these waste sites  and the company has  or is attempting to negotiate  de minimis settlements for their cleanup 
the cleanup of the remaining sites is substantially complete and the company s future obligations entail a share of the sites ongoing operating and maintenance expense 
the company is also addressing three on site cleanups for which it is the primary responsible party 
two of these cleanup sites are in the operation and maintenance stage and the third is in the implementation stage 
based on currently available information  the company does not anticipate that any of these sites will result in material additional costs beyond those already accrued on its balance sheet 

table of contents the company has an accrued liability on its balance sheet to the extent costs are known or can be reasonably estimated for its remaining financial obligations for these matters 
based upon consideration of currently available information  the company does not anticipate any material adverse effect on its results of operations  financial condition  liquidity or competitive position as a result of compliance with federal  state  local or foreign environmental laws or regulations  or cleanup costs relating to the sites discussed above 
changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements see note new accounting standards in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting standards 
critical accounting policies and estimates management has evaluated the accounting policies used in the preparation of the company s financial statements and related notes and believes those policies to be reasonable and appropriate 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
certain of these accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on historical experience  trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
management believes that the amounts recorded in the company s financial statements related to these areas are based on its best judgments and estimates  although actual results could differ materially under different assumptions or conditions 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are recorded at net realizable value 
this value includes an appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that may result from the inability to fully collect amounts due from its customers 
the allowance is determined based on a combination of factors including the length of time that the receivables are past due  history of write offs and the company s knowledge of circumstances relating to specific customers ability to meet their financial obligations 
if economic  industry  or specific customer business trends worsen beyond earlier estimates  the company may increase the allowance for doubtful accounts by recording additional expense 
inventory inventories  which consist primarily of raw materials and finished goods  are carried at the lower of cost or market value 
fixed manufacturing overhead is allocated to the cost of inventory based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
unallocated overhead during periods of abnormally low production levels is recognized as cost of sales in the period in which it is incurred 
as of december   million of the company s inventory is accounted for on a first in  first out fifo basis and the remaining million is accounted for on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the company establishes inventory reserves for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
intangible assets  including goodwill  are assigned to the company s operating segments based upon their fair value at the time of acquisition 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
in accordance with fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  intangible assets deemed to have indefinite 
table of contents lives and goodwill are not subject to amortization but are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired or that there is a probable reduction in the fair value of a reporting unit below its aggregate carrying value 
the company performs the impairment test of the carrying values of its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at the reporting unit level as of june the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step involves comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its aggregate carrying value  including goodwill 
if a reporting unit s aggregate carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value  the company performs the second step of the goodwill impairment test 
the second step involves comparing the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of that goodwill to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles involves a comparison of the estimated fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
in performing its goodwill impairment test  the company determined the estimated fair value of each reporting unit utilizing the income approach model 
this approach makes use of unobservable factors  and the key assumptions that impact the calculation of fair value include the company s estimates of the projected revenues  cash flows and a discount rate applied to such cash flows 
in developing projected revenues and cash flows  the company considered available information including  but not limited to  its short term internal forecasts  historical results  anticipated impact of implemented restructuring initiatives  and its expectations about the depth and duration of the current economic downturn 
in addition  the company forecasted sales growth to trend down to an inflationary growth rate of per annum by and beyond 
the determination of the discount rate was based on the weighted average cost of capital with the cost of equity determined using the capital asset pricing model capm 
the capm uses assumptions such as a risk free rate  a stock beta adjusted risk premium and a size premium 
these assumptions were derived from publicly available information and  therefore  the company believes its assumptions are reflective of the assumptions made by market participants 
additionally  the market approach was used to provide market evidence supporting the company s overall enterprise value and corroborate the reasonableness of the consolidated fair value of equity derived under the income approach as compared to the company s market capitalization  inclusive of an estimated overall control premium 
the company completed its annual impairment test of the carrying values of its goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of june  and concluded that there was no impairment 
in order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculation on the goodwill impairment testing  the company applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair value of each reporting unit  which it believes represented a reasonably possible change at the time of the test 
this hypothetical decrease did not change the results of the company s annual impairment testing 
long lived assets the company accounts for long lived assets  including intangible assets that are amortized  in accordance with fasb asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets fasb asc which requires that all long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
such events and circumstances include the occurrence of an adverse change in the market involving the business employing the related long lived assets or a situation in which it is more likely than not that the company will dispose of such assets 
if indicators of impairment are present  reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of the long lived assets to be held and used is impaired 
such reviews involve a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset group to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by those assets over their remaining useful lives 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impairment loss to be recognized as a non cash charge to earnings is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value and the impaired assets are written down to their fair value or  if fair value is not readily determinable  to an estimated fair value based on discounted expected future cash flows 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less costs to dispose 

table of contents warranty reserves most of the company s sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale  typically months 
the company establishes reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized based upon historical warranty experience and additionally for any known product warranty issues 
although the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  the company s warranty obligation has been and may in the future be affected by product failure rates  repair or field replacement costs and additional development costs incurred in correcting any product failure 
stock based compensation the company accounts for share based payment awards in accordance with fasb asc  compensation stock compensation 
share based payment expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period generally the vesting period of the award 
determination of the fair values of share based payment awards at grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term of the relevant share based awards and the expected volatility of the company s stock 
additionally  management must estimate the amount of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
the expected term of share based awards represents the period of time that the share based awards are expected to be outstanding and is determined based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of the company s stock over the expected term of the award 
expected forfeitures are based on historical experience and have not fluctuated significantly during the past three fiscal years 
pension and other postretirement benefits gardner denver sponsors a number of pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans worldwide 
the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions 
in determining these assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors 
these assumptions include the discount rates used to value the projected benefit obligations  future rate of compensation increases  expected rates of return on plan assets and expected healthcare cost trend rates 
the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the company s benefit obligations as of december  and were derived by examining the rates of high quality  fixed income securities whose cash flows or duration match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments under the plans 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and amortized through net periodic benefit cost over future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect the company s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and future net periodic benefit cost 
actuarial valuations associated with the company s pension plans at december  used a weighted average discount rate of and an expected rate of return on plan assets of 
a decrease in the discount rate would increase annual pension expense by approximately million 
a decrease in the expected return on plan assets would increase the company s annual pension expense by approximately million 
please refer to note benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements for disclosures related to gardner denver s benefit plans  including quantitative disclosures reflecting the impact that changes in certain assumptions would have on service and interest costs and benefit obligations 
income taxes the calculation of the company s income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments 
as part of the company s analysis and implementation of business strategies  consideration is given to the tax laws and regulations that apply to the specific facts and circumstances for any transaction under evaluation 
this analysis includes the amount and timing of the realization of income tax liabilities or benefits 
management closely monitors us and international tax developments in order to evaluate 
table of contents the effect they may have on the company s overall tax position and the estimates and judgments utilized in determining the income tax provision  and records adjustments as necessary 
loss contingencies contingencies  by their nature  relate to uncertainties that require management to exercise judgment both in assessing the likelihood that a liability has been incurred as well as in estimating the amount of the potential loss 
the most significant contingencies impacting the company s financial statements are those related to product warranty  personal injury lawsuits  environmental remediation and the resolution of matters related to open tax years 
see note summary of significant accounting policies  note income taxes and note contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments all derivative financial instruments are reported on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges  any gain or loss on the derivative is recognized in earnings in the current period 
a derivative instrument may be designated as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or liability or variability in expected future cash flows if the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the period of designation 
if a derivative is designated as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative and the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged asset  liability or firm commitment is recognized in earnings 
for derivative instruments designated as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is immediately recognized in earnings 
gains or losses on derivative instruments recognized in earnings are reported in the same line item as the associated hedged transaction in the consolidated statements of operations 
hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when it is determined that a derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item  the derivative is sold  terminated or exercised  the hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or it is unlikely that a forecasted transaction will occur within two months of the originally specified time period 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is determined that the derivative no longer qualifies as an effective fair value hedge  the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value  and the hedged asset or liability is no longer adjusted for changes in fair value 
when cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued because the derivative is sold  terminated  or exercised  the net gain or loss remains in accumulated other comprehensive income and is reclassified into earnings in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings or until it becomes unlikely that a hedged forecasted transaction will occur within two months of the originally scheduled time period 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because a hedged item no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value  and any asset or liability that was recorded pursuant to recognition of the firm commitment is removed from the balance sheet and recognized as a gain or loss currently in earnings 
when hedge accounting is discontinued because it is probable that a forecasted transaction will not occur within two months of the originally specified time period  the derivative continues to be carried on the balance sheet at its fair value  and gains and losses reported in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized immediately through earnings 
restructuring charges the company accounts for costs incurred in connection with the closure and consolidation of facilities and functions in accordance with fasb asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  fasb asc  compensation nonretirement postemployment benefits  fasb asc  fasb asc  business combinations fasb asc  and emerging issues task force eitf no 
superseded by fasb asc 
such costs include employee termination benefits one time arrangements and benefits attributable to prior service  
table of contents termination of contractual obligations  the write down of current and long term assets to the lower of cost or fair value  and other direct incremental costs including relocation of employees  inventory and equipment 
a liability is established through a charge to operations for i one time employee termination benefits when management commits to a plan of termination and communicates such plan to the affected group of employees  ii employee termination benefits that accumulate or vest based on prior service when it becomes probable that such termination benefits will be paid and the amount of the payment can be reasonably estimated  and iii contract termination costs when the contract is terminated or the company becomes contractually obligated to make such payment 
if an operating lease is not terminated  a liability is established when the company ceases use of the leased property 
other direct incremental costs are charged to operations as incurred 
with respect to business combinations consummated prior to january   liabilities for employee termination and relocation benefits and contractual obligations of the acquired company  contemplated at the acquisition date and finalized within one year of the acquisition date  are included in  and recorded as adjustments to  goodwill 
with respect to certain restructuring charges for which the company expects to receive funding from governments grants  such charges are reduced by the amount of the probable anticipated funding 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to certain market risks during the normal course of business arising from adverse changes in commodity prices  interest rates  and currency exchange rates 
the company s exposure to these risks is managed through a combination of operating and financing activities 
the company selectively uses derivative financial instruments derivatives  including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps  to manage the risks from fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company does not hold derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates  and currency exchange rates can be volatile  and the company s risk management activities do not totally eliminate these risks 
consequently  these fluctuations could have a significant effect on the company s financial results 
notional transaction amounts and fair values for the company s outstanding derivatives  by risk category and instrument type  as of december  and  are summarized in note hedging activities  derivative instruments and credit risk in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
commodity price risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  principally aluminum 
in addition  the company is a purchaser of components and parts containing various commodities  including cast iron  aluminum  copper and steel 
the company generally buys these commodities and components based upon market prices that are established with the vendor as part of the purchase process 
the company does not use commodity financial instruments to hedge commodity prices 
the company has long term contracts with some of its suppliers of key components 
however  to the extent that commodity prices increase and the company does not have firm pricing from its suppliers  or its suppliers are not able to honor such prices  then the company may experience margin declines to the extent it is not able to increase selling prices of its products 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk results primarily from its borrowings of million at december  the company manages its debt centrally  considering tax consequences and its overall financing strategies 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk by maintaining a mixture of fixed and variable rate debt and uses pay fixed interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges of variable rate debt in order to adjust the relative proportions 
the interest rates on approximately of the company s borrowings were effectively fixed as of december  if the relevant libor amounts for all of the company s borrowings had been basis points higher than actual in  the company s interest expense would have increased by million 

table of contents exchange rate risk a substantial portion of the company s operations is conducted by its subsidiaries outside of the us in currencies other than the usd 
almost all of the company s non us subsidiaries conduct their business primarily in their local currencies  which are also their functional currencies 
other than the usd  the eur  gbp  and cny are the principal currencies in which the company and its subsidiaries enter into transactions 
the company is exposed to the impacts of changes in currency exchange rates on the translation of its non us subsidiaries assets  liabilities  and earnings into usd 
the company partially offsets these exposures by having certain of its non us subsidiaries act as the obligor on a portion of its borrowings and by denominating such borrowings  as well as a portion of the borrowings for which the company is the obligor  in currencies other than the usd 
of the company s total net assets of  million at december   approximately million was denominated in currencies other than the usd 
borrowings by the company s non us subsidiaries at december  totaled million  and the company s consolidated borrowings denominated in currencies other than the usd totaled million 
fluctuations due to changes in currency exchange rates in the value of non usd borrowings that have been designated as hedges of the company s net investment in foreign operations are included in other comprehensive income 
the company and its subsidiaries are also subject to the risk that arises when they  from time to time  enter into transactions in currencies other than their functional currency 
to mitigate this risk  the company and its subsidiaries typically settle intercompany trading balances monthly 
the company also selectively uses forward currency contracts to manage this risk 
at december   the notional amount of open forward currency contracts was million and their aggregate fair value was a liability of million 
to illustrate the impact of currency exchange rates on the company s financial results  the company s operating income would have decreased by approximately million if the usd had been more valuable than actual relative to other currencies 
this calculation assumes that all currencies change in the same direction and proportion to the usd and that there are no indirect effects of the change in the value of the usd such as changes in non usd sales volumes or prices
