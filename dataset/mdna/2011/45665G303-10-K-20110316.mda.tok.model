item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis and set forth elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should review the section titled risk factors in part i item a of this report for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis 
business overview overview we are a drug discovery and development company that is utilizing our strength in small molecule drug technologies to discover and develop medicines for difficult to treat diseases 
our discovery program has generated four clinical stage drug candidates spanning programs in the inhibition of the hedgehog signaling pathway  heat shock protein  or hsp  chaperone system  and fatty acid amide hydrolase  or faah 
in july  we also obtained global development and commercialization rights to develop inhibitors of the delta and gamma isoforms of phosphoinositide kinase  or pik 
hedgehog pathway inhibitor program 
our lead product candidate is ipi  a novel  potent  oral molecule that inhibits the hedgehog pathway by binding to the smoothened receptor  a protein that plays a critical role in the malignant activation of the hedgehog pathway 
we believe that smoothened inhibition represents a significant opportunity for addressing a number of difficult to treat cancers by disrupting malignant activation of the hedgehog pathway 
we are actively enrolling patients in the phase portion of a phase b clinical trial evaluating ipi in combination with gemcitabine  also known as gemzar  in patients with previously untreated  metastatic  pancreatic cancer and have initiated a phase clinical trial evaluating ipi as a single agent in patients with metastatic or locally advanced  inoperable chondrosarcoma 
we expect to present data from the phase b portion of the pancreatic cancer trial later this year 
we are also evaluating ipi in a phase clinical trial in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors  including patients with basal cell carcinoma  or bcc 
preliminary data from this trial were presented at the european society for medical oncology congress in october and we expect to present follow up data at a medical meeting later in mundipharma international corporation limited  or mundipharma  has commercialization rights outside of the united states for products arising out of our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program 
hsp chaperone inhibitor program 
our next most advanced program is directed at hsp which is emerging as a major therapeutic target of interest for the treatment of a broad range of cancers 
inhibition of the hsp chaperone knocks out a critical source of support for cancer cells  leading to tumor growth inhibition and cancer cell death 
thus  hsp chaperone inhibition may represent an important approach to treating certain cancers 
our lead hsp inhibitor  ipi  is a novel  small molecule  semi synthetic analog of the natural product geldanamycin that is delivered as a water based  intravenous infusion 
ipi is currently being evaluated in two ongoing clinical trials  both of which are focused on patients with non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
one trial is a phase b trial in combination with docetaxel  also known as taxotere  that initially enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors and expanded in to focus on patients with advanced nsclc 
the second trial is an investigator sponsored trial in nsclc patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase  or alk  gene rearrangements 
we anticipate reporting final data from the phase b trial during we also expect to present data from a completed phase clinical trial evaluating ipi in combination with herceptin trastuzumab in patients with her positive metastatic breast cancer at a medical meeting in in parallel with the development of ipi  we are pursuing development of ipi  a proprietary  orally available inhibitor of hsp ipi has demonstrated anti tumor activity in multiple preclinical models of human cancer  including nsclc  breast cancer  colon cancer  and hematological malignancies 
we are evaluating ipi in two phase  dose escalation studies to determine the optimal dose and schedule for future development 

table of contents in  we anticipate reporting data from our hsp program and announcing a path forward based on data from our ongoing clinical trials and relevant preclinical studies 
we have worldwide development and commercialization rights for our hsp chaperone inhibitor program 
pik inhibitor program 
in july  we entered into a development and license agreement with intellikine  inc  or intellikine  under which we obtained global development and commercialization rights to intellikine s portfolio of inhibitors targeting the delta and or gamma isoforms of pik 
we believe that specifically targeting pikdelta and pikgamma may provide multiple opportunities to develop differentiated therapies against inflammatory and autoimmune diseases as well as hematologic cancers 
our lead compound in this program  ipi  is an orally available  small molecule  dual selective inhibitor of pikdelta and pikgamma 
ipi has demonstrated activity in several preclinical models of inflammation 
we intend to commence clinical development of ipi in the second half of mundipharma has commercialization rights outside of the united states for products arising from our pik inhibitor program 
faah inhibitor program 
finally  we have a program directed toward fatty acid amide hydrolase  or faah 
it is believed that inhibition of faah may enable the body to bolster its own analgesic and anti inflammatory response  and may have applicability in a broad range of painful or inflammatory conditions 
the lead compound in our faah program is ipi  a novel  orally available inhibitor of faah with potential application for the treatment of a broad range of painful or inflammatory conditions 
in october  we reported top line data from a phase randomized clinical trial of ipi in healthy adult volunteers demonstrating marked faah inhibition and increased anandamide levels 
in addition  ipi was well tolerated  with no observed dose limiting toxicities or clinically significant changes in clinical laboratory values  vital signs or electrocardiogram parameters 
additional phase development of ipi is ongoing 
in october  mundipharma and its independent associated company purdue pharmaceutical products lp  or purdue  exercised their rights to assume worldwide development and commercialization activities for products arising out of the faah program and will fund of all subsequent research  development and commercialization expenses 
we anticipate completing transition activities for the faah program in to facilitate phase clinical trials in pain by purdue 
collaboration agreements purdue and mundipharma 
in november  we entered into strategic alliance agreements with each of purdue and mundipharma to develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products 
the alliance currently includes product candidates that inhibit or target the hedgehog pathway  faah  pik  and product candidates arising out of all our discovery projects in all disease fields that are conducted during a prescribed funded discovery period 
in december  mundipharma exercised an option to extend the duration of the funded discovery period through december  and mundipharma has the option to extend this period for an additional year 
our hsp program is expressly excluded from the alliance 
the agreement with purdue is focused on the development and us commercialization of products targeting faah 
the agreement with mundipharma is focused on the development and commercialization outside of the united states of all products and product candidates covered by the alliance  including those targeting faah 
following entry into the strategic alliance agreements in november  we consider mundipharma  purdue and associated entities to be related parties for financial reporting purposes because of their equity ownership in our company 
under the strategic alliance agreements  we have responsibility and decision making authority for the performance of early discovery projects and the development of all product candidates on a worldwide basis 
there are no joint steering or similar committees for the alliance 
in october  mundipharma and purdue exercised their rights to assume worldwide development and commercialization activities for products arising out of the faah program and will fund of all subsequent research  development and commercialization 
table of contents expenses 
for the remaining programs included in the alliance  mundipharma is obligated to pay of our contractually budgeted amounts for research and development expenses incurred by us until the later of december  and the commencement of the first phase clinical trial of such product candidate  which we refer to as the transition date 
the contractually budgeted amount for the period between november  and december  was million and the contractually budgeted amounts for the year ended december  was million 
the contractually budgeted amounts for and are million and million  respectively 
any activities we conduct related to the transition of the faah program to purdue and mundipharma will be reimbursed in addition to the contractually budgeted amount 
we recognized million in revenue related to reimbursed research and development services for the transition of the faah program for the year ended december  the transition of the faah program and the associated revenue for reimbursed research and development services will continue into the fiscal year ended december  for the remaining programs in the alliance  we have the right to exceed the contractually budgeted amount at our own expense  which we did in due primarily to the license of our pik inhibitor program  and which we expect to be the case in on account of enhanced clinical trial activities for ipi and the commencement of clinical development of ipi after the transition date for each product candidate  we will share with mundipharma all research and development costs for such product candidate equally 
we are recognizing revenue for reimbursed research and development services we perform for mundipharma and purdue 
we recognized million  million and million in such revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 
in december  we amended our strategic alliance agreement with mundipharma 
under the original agreement mundipharma had the right to opt out of any early discovery project or any preclinical or clinical development program on an annual basis in november of each year 
in the event of an opt out decision  mundipharma would continue to provide funding for  in the aggregate  of our contractually budgeted research and development expenses for all programs included in the alliance for the calendar year following the date of such opt out 
under the amendment  these time based decisions have been modified to become event based for the hedgehog program only 
mundipharma will continue to have time based annual opt out rights in november of each year for the other programs in the alliance 
under the amendment  mundipharma s next funding commitment for the hedgehog program must be made by the th day following the outcome of an end of phase meeting with the us food and drug administration pertaining to the ongoing clinical trial of ipi in patients with pancreatic cancer or  if the end of phase meeting is not held by november   then by november  
mundipharma is obligated to fully fund the hedgehog program until it is required to make this further commitment 
if mundipharma elects to opt out of continued development funding at this time  then mundipharma would be obligated to make an immediate payment of million to us  which we can use on any research or development program in the alliance 
in addition  mundipharma would be obligated to reimburse us for up to million of additional expenses incurred during that are associated with the completion of phase clinical trials of ipi that are ongoing at the time of the opt out  so that aggregate residual funding could total million 
if mundipharma elects to continue participation in the hedgehog program when it makes its next commitment  mundipharma would thereafter have the annual november opt out right  and one year residual funding obligation  contained in the original agreement 
in addition  we and mundipharma each have the right to opt out of continued development of a product candidate after it has reached the transition date  with a one year tail funding obligation for of post transition date research and development expenses for the product candidate 
if a party exercises its right to opt out of the development of a product or product candidate after the transition date  the other party may elect to continue the development and assume responsibility for the worldwide commercialization of such product or product candidate  subject to the payment of a royalty 

table of contents except as set forth above with respect to faah products and opt out products  we will have the right and responsibility to market and sell products arising from the alliance in the united states and mundipharma will have the right and responsibility to market and sell products arising from the alliance outside of the united states 
other than pursuant to the strategic alliance agreements  neither we  purdue nor mundipharma may develop  manufacture or commercialize products that arise out of the research program or products that are directed to the same target or pathway as a product included in the research program  unless and until a party terminates its rights with respect to such products 
if we in license any product or product candidate during the funded discovery period for which glp good laboratory practice toxicology studies have been initiated and commercialization rights outside of the united states are available for grant by us to mundipharma  mundipharma will have the option to include such in licensed product or product candidate in the alliance by paying us a prescribed percentage of the up front license fee or other acquisition cost  which percentage could be up to of such fee or cost  in order for mundipharma to obtain commercialization rights for such in licensed product or product candidate in all countries outside of the united states  and by funding research and development costs in the same manner as products or product candidates arising out of our internal discovery programs 
the agreement with mundipharma provides for the agreed upon research and development budgets to be updated to reflect the inclusion of any in licensed products or product candidates 
there will be no royalties paid between the parties on in licensed candidates 
if we in license any product or product candidate during the funded discovery period for which glp toxicology studies have not been initiated  as we did with our pik program in  such products are automatically included in the alliance as having arisen out of our internal discovery projects within the then existing contractually budgeted amounts 
except with respect to products that have been in licensed by us  for which no royalties will be payable between the parties  we are obligated to pay mundipharma a royalty on net sales of the commercialized products until such time as mundipharma has recovered all research and development expenses paid to us under the research program prior to the applicable transition date 
after such cost recovery  we are obligated to pay a tiered  to royalty on us net sales of those products 
for products in which mundipharma has opted out of development prior to the transition date  we are obligated to pay royalties of to of worldwide net sales as a function of the stage of development of the applicable product candidate at the time of opt out 
for products in which either party has opted out of development following the transition date  the commercializing party is obligated to pay the other party a royalty on net sales 
mundipharma is obligated to pay us a tiered  to royalty on annual net sales outside of the united states of each product arising out of the alliance  and purdue is obligated to pay us a tiered  to royalty on annual net sales of faah products in the united states 
royalties are payable until the later to occur of the last to expire of specified patent rights and the expiration of non patent regulatory exclusivities in a country  provided that if royalties are payable solely on the basis of non patent regulatory exclusivity  each of the rates above is reduced by one half 
in addition  all royalties payable under the strategic alliance agreements  whether by us  purdue or mundipharma  are subject to reduction on account of third party royalty payments or patent litigation damages or settlements  with any such reductions capped at of the amounts otherwise payable during the applicable royalty payment period 
each of the strategic alliance agreements expire when the parties thereto have no further obligations to each other thereunder 
either party may terminate the strategic alliance agreement to which it is a party on days prior written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within the day notice period 
the agreements may also be terminated by purdue or mundipharma in the event of a change in control of infinity or in the event that  during the funded discovery period  either adelene perkins or julian adams is no longer a full time executive of infinity 
upon termination of either strategic alliance agreement by us or either purdue or mundipharma  either party to the other strategic alliance agreement may terminate that agreement 
in connection with the entry into the strategic alliance agreements  we also entered into a securities purchase agreement and line of credit agreement with purdue and its independent associated company  purdue pharma lp  or pplp 
in march  purdue assigned its interest under the line of credit agreement to pplp 
under the securities purchase agreement we issued and sold in a first equity closing in november an aggregate of four 
table of contents million shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
of such shares  two million shares of our common stock were purchased by each purchaser 
in january  we conducted a second equity closing where we issued and sold an aggregate of two million shares of our common stock  and warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of six million shares of our common stock  for an aggregate purchase price of million 
of the second closing securities  an equal number were purchased by each purchaser 
for the fiscal year ended december   we recorded million as deferred revenue associated with the grant of rights and licenses to mundipharma and purdue in november this amount was comprised of million for the excess of the amount paid by purdue and pplp for our common stock per share over the closing market price on the day before the first equity closing per share and million representing the fair value of the pplp s commitment to extend a line of credit at below market terms the loan commitment asset as discussed below 
in  we considered our obligation  absent material adverse changes  to issue purdue and pplp the second closing securities to be a forward contract with immaterial intrinsic value  which was recorded in stockholders equity 
this forward contract closed in january upon the issuance of the second closing securities 
in january  we recorded an additional million as deferred revenue associated with the grant of rights and licenses to mundipharma and purdue  representing the excess of the million paid by purdue and pplp for the second closing securities over the fair market value of these securities per share for the common stock and approximately million for the warrants as of the day before the first equity closing 
the line of credit agreement provides for the borrowing by us of one or more unsecured loans up to an aggregate maximum principal amount of million 
the loans may be drawn by us during the three year period that began on april  the loans  which may be used by us for any proper corporate purpose  mature on april   which we refer to as the maturity date  and will be subordinate to any senior indebtedness that we may incur 
borrowings made under the line of credit agreement will bear interest  payable on the maturity date  at a fluctuating rate set at the prime rate on the business day prior to the funding of each loan and will be reset on the last business day of each month ending thereafter 
interest will be compounded on each successive three month anniversary of the funding of each loan 
outstanding loans may be prepaid without penalty or premium prior to the maturity date 
amounts borrowed under the credit agreement  once borrowed  may not be borrowed again 
we have certain rights to repay outstanding amounts under the line of credit agreement in shares of our common stock 
the extension of the line of credit at an interest rate below our incremental borrowing rate represented the transfer of additional value to us in the arrangement 
as such  we recorded the fair value of the line of credit of million as a loan commitment asset on our balance sheet in we began amortizing this asset to interest expense over the life of the loan arrangement  or years  on april  we recorded approximately million and million of related amortization expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
beginning with the fiscal year ended december  we recorded the offset to the loan commitment asset to deferred revenue 
as of december   no amounts have been borrowed under this line of credit 
since the shares of our common stock were purchased by purdue and pplp at a premium to the closing stock price on november   and the fair value of the rights and licenses transferred as part of the collaboration arrangement could not be reliably determined  we have attributed the premium over the closing price of our common stock using the residual method to the grant of rights and licenses to mundipharma and purdue 
in addition  we have attributed the value of the loan commitment asset of million using the residual method to the grant of rights and licenses to mundipharma and purdue 
there is no obligation for us to repay the million allocated to the grant of rights and licenses and we are recognizing the deferred revenue ratably over years  which is our estimated period of performance under the arrangement 
we will periodically review this estimate and make adjustments as facts and circumstances dictate 
we recognized million  million and million in such revenue in the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents intellikine 
in july  we entered a development and license agreement with intellikine under which we obtained rights to discover  develop and commercialize pharmaceutical products targeting the delta and or gamma isoforms of pik  including ipi we paid intellikine a million upfront license fee 
the entirety of this fee is included as research and development expense in the year ended december   although million of this fee was paid in january in addition  we provide financial support for research activities that may be conducted by intellikine under a two year research program to identify additional novel delta  gamma and dual delta gamma specific inhibitors of pik for future development 
we are recognizing these costs as research and development expense as they are incurred 
we may extend the research program for an additional year upon written notice to intellikine at least days prior to the last day of the initial two year research term 
we are also obligated to pay up to million in success based milestones for the development of two distinct product candidates  and up to million in success based milestones for the approval and commercialization of two distinct products 
in addition  we are obligated to pay intellikine tiered royalties ranging from single digits to low teens upon successful commercialization of products licensed to us  which are payable until the later to occur of the last to expire of specified patent rights and the expiration of non patent regulatory exclusivities in a country  subject to reduction in certain circumstances 
under the agreement  we obtained rights to direct all development and commercialization activities worldwide for products arising from the agreement for all therapeutic indications 
mundipharma  pursuant to its strategic alliance agreement with us  has commercialization rights outside the united states for products arising out of our pik inhibitor program 
for a product directed primarily to an oncology indication  intellikine will have the option  at the end of phase clinical development and upon payment of an option fee  to convert its royalty interest in us sales into the right to share in of profits and losses on us development and commercialization  and to participate in up to of the detailing effort for these products in the united states 
intellikine may terminate its participation rights in any oncology product with twelve months prior written notice to us  after which intellikine s participation rights would revert back to the original milestone and royalty based payment structure  provided that intellikine would not be entitled to receive royalty payments for net sales occurring prior to the termination date and certain specified milestone payments 
other than pursuant to the agreement  neither we nor intellikine may research  develop or commercialize products directed to the pik delta and or gamma isoforms which meet certain selectivity criteria 
the agreement expires when the parties have no further obligations to each other thereunder  unless earlier terminated 
either party may terminate the agreement on days prior written notice if the other party materially breaches the agreement and fails to cure such breach within the applicable notice period  provided that the notice period is reduced to days where the alleged breach is non payment 
additionally  intellikine may terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice if we or a related party bring an action challenging the validity of any of the licensed patents  provided that we have not withdrawn such action before the end of the day notice period 
we may terminate the agreement at any time upon days prior written notice provided after the end of the research term 
medimmune az 
prior to december  we had been a party to a product development and commercialization agreement with medimmune  inc  a division of astrazeneca plc  or medimmune az  to jointly develop and commercialize cancer drugs targeting hsp and the hedgehog pathway 
this agreement was a cost sharing arrangement in which we shared development costs equally with medimmune az 
in november  we regained from medimmune az worldwide development and commercialization rights under our hedgehog pathway program on a royalty free basis 
in december  we regained from medimmune az worldwide development and commercialization rights under our hsp chaperone inhibitor program 
in january  we reached an agreement with medimmune az to settle the residual funding obligation remaining for through lump sum payments totaling million  which were recorded as income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program a component of other income in the year ended december  we received million in cash from medimmune az in the year ended december  
table of contents the profit and cost sharing provisions of our arrangement with medimmune az are no longer applicable  and we have full control over all future development and commercialization activities under our hsp and hedgehog pathway programs  subject to the payment of single digit royalties to medimmune az on worldwide net sales  if any  of each of ipi and ipi we do not have a royalty obligation to medimmune az on any future sales of ipi financial overview revenue all of our revenue to date has been derived from license fees  the reimbursement of research and development costs  contract service revenue and milestones payments received from our collaboration partners 
as the agreements with mundipharma and purdue provide for funding for our research and development efforts  we recognize this cost reimbursement as revenue in the period earned in proportion to our forecasted total expenses as compared to the total research funding budget for the year 
in the future  we may generate revenue from a combination of product sales  research and development support services and milestone payments in connection with strategic relationships  and royalties resulting from the sales of products developed under licenses of our intellectual property 
we expect that any revenue we generate will fluctuate from year to year as a result of the timing and amount of license fees  research and development reimbursement  milestone and other payments earned under our collaborative or strategic relationships  and the amount and timing of payments that we earn upon the sale of our products  to the extent any are successfully commercialized 
if we fail to complete the development of our drug candidates in a timely manner or obtain regulatory approval for them  our ability to generate future revenue  and our results of operations and financial position  would be materially adversely affected 
research and development expense we are a drug discovery and development company 
our research and development expense primarily consists of the following compensation of personnel associated with research activities  clinical testing costs  including payments made to contract research organizations  laboratory supplies and materials  manufacturing drug candidates for preclinical testing and clinical studies  costs associated with the licensing of research and development programs  preclinical testing costs  including costs of toxicology studies  fees paid to external consultants  fees paid to professional service providers for independent monitoring and analysis of our clinical trials  costs for collaboration partners to perform research activities  depreciation of equipment  and allocated costs of facilities 
under our collaboration with medimmune az  we shared research and development expenses equally with medimmune az 
in december  we reacquired from medimmune az worldwide development and commercialization rights to our hsp chaperone inhibitor program 
amounts reimbursed by medimmune az under the cost sharing provisions of the parties collaboration agreement incurred prior to our reacquisition of the hsp chaperone inhibitor program were recorded as a reduction of research and development expense in our 
table of contents statements of operations 
amounts reimbursed by medimmune az incurred following the reacquisition of the hsp chaperone inhibitor program were recorded as income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program in our statements of operations 
this cost sharing arrangement also applied to our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program through may  general and administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consists of compensation of personnel in executive  finance  accounting  legal  information technology infrastructure  corporate communications  human resources and commercial functions 
other costs include facilities costs not otherwise included in research and development expense  and professional fees for legal and accounting services 
general and administrative expense also consists of the costs of maintaining our intellectual property portfolio 
other income and expense interest expense and other interest and investment income typically consists of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities  net of interest expense  and amortization of warrants 
interest expense includes amortization of the loan commitment asset from pplp starting on april  reimbursable amounts from medimmune az incurred following the reacquisition of the hsp program in december were recorded as income from residual funding  which is included in other income and expense 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses  assumptions in the valuation of stock based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most critical to aid you in understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements for a description of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition to date  all of our revenue has been generated under research collaboration agreements 
the terms of these research collaboration agreements may include payment to us of non refundable  up front license fees  funding or reimbursement of research and development efforts  milestone payments if specified objectives are achieved  and or royalties on product sales 
we divide agreements containing multiple elements into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the collaborative partner and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered obligation s 
for these agreements  we allocate the consideration we receive among the separate units based on their respective fair values or  in some cases  the residual method  and we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria to each of the separate units 
we recognize revenues from non refundable  up front license fees on a straight line basis over the contracted or estimated period of performance  which is typically the research or development term 
we recognize research and development funding as earned over the period of effort as related research costs are incurred in proportion to our forecasted total expenses as compared to the total research funding budget for the year 
we regularly consider whether events warrant a change in the estimated period of performance under an agreement 
such a change would cause us to modify the period of time over which we recognize revenue from the up front license fee on a prospective basis and would  in turn  result in changes in our quarterly and annual results 

table of contents we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if the milestone payment is non refundable  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with achievement of the milestone  and the milestone is at risk for both parties 
if any of these conditions is not met  we defer the recognition of revenue underlying the milestone payment and recognize it over the remaining estimated period of performance under the contract as we complete our performance obligations 
we will recognize royalty revenue  if any  based upon actual and estimated net sales by the licensee of licensed products in licensed territories  and in the period the sales occur 
we have not recognized any royalty revenues to date 
we exercise our judgment in determining whether an agreement contains multiple elements and  if so  how much revenue is allocable to each element 
in addition  we exercise our judgment in determining when our significant obligations have been met under such agreements and the specific time periods over which we recognize revenue  such as non refundable  up front license fees 
to the extent that actual facts and circumstances differ from our initial judgments  our revenue recognition with respect to such transactions would change accordingly and any such change could affect our reported operating results 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of expenses incurred in performing research and development activities  including salaries and benefits  facilities expenses  overhead expenses  materials and supplies  preclinical expenses  clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing expenses  costs associated with the licensing of research and development programs  stock based compensation expense  contract services  and other outside expenses 
we expense research and development costs as they are incurred 
we have entered into certain collaboration agreements in which expenses are shared with the collaborator  others in which we are reimbursed for work performed on behalf of the collaborator  and another in which we reimburse the collaborator for work it has performed 
we record all of our expenses as research and development expense 
if the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we receive payments from the collaborator  we record payments from the collaborator for its share of the development effort as a reduction of research and development expense 
if the arrangement is a cost sharing arrangement and there is a period during which we make payments to the collaborator  we record our payments to the collaborator for its share of the development effort as additional research and development expense 
if the arrangement provides for reimbursement of research and development expenses  as is the case with our alliance with mundipharma and purdue  we record the reimbursement as revenue 
if the arrangement provides for us to reimburse the collaborator for research and development expenses  as is the case with our agreement with intellikine  we record the reimbursement as research and development expense 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf  and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date 
examples of services for which we must estimate accrued expenses include contract service fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with pharmaceutical development work and to contract research organizations in connection with clinical trials and preclinical studies 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided 
the majority of our service providers invoice us in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have been incurred by our service providers  or if we over or under estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services in any given period  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
we often rely on subjective judgments to determine the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us 
our estimates of expenses in future periods may be over or under accrued 

table of contents stock based compensation we expense the fair value of employee stock options and other equity compensation 
we use our judgment in determining the fair value of our equity instruments  including in selecting the inputs we use for the black scholes valuation model 
equity instrument valuation models are by their nature highly subjective 
any significant changes in any of our judgments  including those used to select the inputs for the black scholes valuation model  could have a significant impact on the fair value of the equity instruments granted and the associated compensation charge we record in our financial statements 
fair value measurements we define fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we determine fair value based on the assumptions market participants use when pricing the asset or liability 
we also use the fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop these assumptions 
the carrying amounts reflected in the condensed consolidated balance sheets for notes receivable from employees  prepaid expenses and other current assets  accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to their short term maturities 
new accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued accounting standard update no 
 milestone method of revenue recognition asu no 
 which provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
prior to the issuance of asu no 
 authoritative guidance on the use of the milestone method did not exist 
asu no 
is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  with early adoption permitted 
alternatively  asu no 
can be adopted retrospectively for all prior periods 
we do not expect the adoption of asu no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements or results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standard update no 
 multiple element revenue arrangements asu no 
 which updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangements guidance currently included in accounting standards codification no 
in two ways 
the first change relates to the determination of when the individual deliverables included in a multiple element arrangement may be treated as separate units of accounting 
this is significant as it will likely result in the requirement to separate more deliverables within an arrangement  ultimately leading to less revenue deferral 
the second change modifies the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables 
asu no 
also significantly expands the disclosures required for multiple element revenue arrangements 
asu no 
will be effective for the first annual reporting period beginning on or after june   and may be applied retrospectively for all periods presented or prospectively to arrangements entered into or materially modified after the adoption date 
we do not expect the adoption of asu no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements or results of operations 

table of contents results of operations the following table summarizes our results of operations for the years ended december   and  in thousands  together with the change in each item as a percentage 
change change revenue research and development expense general and administrative expense interest expense interest and investment income income from settlement with nih income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program income from therapeutic discovery grants income tax benefit revenue our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million related to reimbursed research and development services we performed under our strategic alliance entered into with mundipharma and purdue in november  which includes million related to the transition of our faah program to mundipharma and purdue  and million related to the amortization of the deferred revenue associated with the grant of rights and licenses under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue 
our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million related to reimbursed research and development services we performed under our strategic alliance entered into with mundipharma and purdue in november  and million related to the amortization of the deferred revenue associated with the grant of rights and licenses under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue 
our revenue during the year ended december  consisted of approximately million associated with the amortization and acceleration of the up front license fee received from medimmune az  million related to a milestone payment from medimmune az upon initiation of our phase trial of ipi in patients with gist  million related to the amortization and acceleration of the non refundable license fee  and million related to the reimbursable research and development services we performed  under a former research collaboration with novartis  and million related to reimbursed research and development services we performed under our strategic alliance with mundipharma and purdue 
in the absence of any business development activities that generate revenue  we currently expect that all of our revenue in will be derived from reimbursed research and development services and amortization of deferred revenue under our alliance with purdue and mundipharma 

table of contents research and development expense research and development expenses represented approximately of our total operating expenses for the year ended december   of our total operating expenses for the year ended december   and of our total operating expenses for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an up front license fee of million related to in licensing our pik program from intellikine and million of related reimbursement for research and development services performed by intellikine  an increase of million in compensation and benefits  which was primarily driven by annual base salary increases and an increase in our contingent cash compensation program  an increase of million in clinical expenses as our hedgehog and faah programs have advanced  and an increase of million in consulting expenses primarily related to our hedgehog and faah programs 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to a decrease of million in amounts reimbursed by medimmune az under the cost sharing provisions of our collaboration agreement  an increase of million in pharmaceutical development expenses as our hsp and hedgehog programs have advanced  an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including stock based compensation  for our research and development personnel  which was primarily driven by the hiring of new research and development personnel and annual base salary increases  and partially offset by a decrease in accrued amounts under our contingent cash compensation program  an increase of million in consulting expenses primarily related to the clinical development of ipi  and an increase of million in preclinical expenses as our faah program has advanced 
we began to track and accumulate costs by major program starting on january  the following table sets forth our estimates of research and development expenses  by program  over the last three years and cumulatively from january  to december  these expenses primarily relate to payroll and related expenses for personnel working on the programs  process development and manufacturing  preclinical toxicology studies  clinical trial costs and allocated costs of facilities 
from august through december  our hsp chaperone inhibitor program was conducted in collaboration with medimmune az  and from august through november  our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program was conducted in collaboration with medimmune az 
under this collaboration  we shared research and development expenses equally with medimmune az 
pursuant to our cost sharing agreement  reimbursable amounts from medimmune az were credited to research and development expenses for our hsp program through december  and for our hedgehog pathway inhibitors program through may  the expenses for the hsp chaperone inhibitor and hedgehog pathway inhibitor programs include credits of approximately million for the year ended december  dollars in millions program year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  january  to december  hedgehog pathway inhibitor hsp chaperone inhibitor faah inhibitor pik inhibitor bcl includes a license fee of million 
table of contents we expect expenses for our hedgehog pathway inhibitor program to increase as we seek to make progress in the clinical development of ipi we also expect expenses for our pik inhibitor program to increase as we anticipate commencing clinical development in in addition  we expect expenses for our faah program to decrease as we transition the development activities to purdue and mundipharma 
for these and other reasons  we do not believe that the historical costs associated with our lead drug development programs are indicative of the future costs associated with these programs or represent what any other future drug development program we initiate may cost 
due to the variability in the length of time and scope of activities necessary to develop a drug candidate  uncertainties related to cost estimates and our ability to obtain marketing approval for our drug candidates  accurate and meaningful estimates of the total costs required to bring our product candidates to market are not available 
because of the risks inherent in drug discovery and development  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of our programs  the anticipated completion dates of these programs  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence  if at all  from the programs described above and any potential future product candidates 
there is significant uncertainty regarding our ability to successfully develop any drug candidates 
these risks include the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials that we are currently running or may commence in the future  the scope  rate of progress of our preclinical studies and other research and development activities  clinical trial results  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights relating to our programs under development  the terms and timing of any strategic alliance  licensing and other arrangements that we have or may establish in the future relating to our programs under development  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of establishing clinical supplies of any product candidates  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
general and administrative expense the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including stock based compensation expense for general and administrative employees  which was primarily driven by an increase in accrued amounts under our contingent cash compensation program as well as stock based compensation expense related to the transition of our executive chair to non employee chair  and an increase of million in legal expenses  principally related to patent expenses including our newly acquired pik program  and a decrease of million in consulting expenses  principally related to a decrease in early commercial development activities 

table of contents the increase in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is primarily attributable to an increase of million in compensation and benefits  including stock based compensation expense for general and administrative employees  which was primarily driven by the hiring of new general and administrative personnel  and annual base salary increases  and partially offset by a decrease in accrued amounts under our contingent cash compensation program  and an increase of million in consulting expenses  principally related to early commercial development and public relations services 
interest expense interest expense increased for the year ended december  compared to the years ended december  and primarily as a result of amortizing the loan commitment asset from purdue 
we expect interest expense in to be comparable to interest and investment income interest and investment income decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of lower yields on our cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
we expect interest and investment income in to be comparable to interest and investment income decreased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  primarily as a result of lower yields on our cash equivalents and available for sale securities 
income from therapeutic discovery grants during the year ended december   we received tax grants aggregating million under the us government s qualifying therapeutic discovery project program for qualified expenses related to our hedgehog  hsp and faah programs 
income from nih reimbursement during the year ended december   we received million from the national institutes of health  or nih  relating to contract work performed by discovery partners international  inc from august through june we do not expect any such income in future periods 
income from residual funding of hsp program following our reacquisition of the hsp program in december  medimmune az remained obligated to fund an amount equivalent to its share of the hsp program costs for the ensuing six month period 
reimbursable amounts from the date of reacquisition december  to december  were recorded as income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program 
in january  we agreed with medimmune az to settle the residual funding obligations through lump sum payments totaling million  which we also recorded as income from residual funding after reacquisition of hsp program in the year ended december  income tax benefit during the year ended december   we recorded an income tax benefit of million because an uncertain tax position we took in a prior year was no longer subject to examination due to the expiration of the 
table of contents statute of limitations 
we realized an income tax benefit of approximately million for the year ended december  primarily due to the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of this law contains a provision that permits companies to carry back certain or net operating losses for a period of up to five years and receive a benefit for prior tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources we have not generated any revenue from the sale of drugs to date  and we do not expect to generate any such revenue for the next several years  if at all 
we have instead relied on the proceeds from sales of equity securities  interest on investments  license fees  expense reimbursement under our collaborations  milestone payments  contract service payments and debt to fund our operations 
our available for sale debt securities primarily trade in liquid markets  and the average days to maturity of our portfolio  as of december   is less than six months 
because our product candidates are in various stages of clinical and preclinical development and the outcome of these efforts is uncertain  we cannot estimate the actual amounts necessary to successfully complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates or whether  or when  we may achieve profitability 
our significant capital resources are as follows in thousands december  december  cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities including long term working capital years ended december  cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above financing activities cash flows the principal use of cash in operating activities in all periods presented was our net spending on our research and development programs  that is  investments in research and development that are not reimbursed by our strategic alliance partners 
currently  spending on all of our research and development programs other than our hsp program are reimbursed by purdue and mundipharma up to a contractually specified annual cap  which was million in and is million in other than the income from residual funding of million in  we have not been reimbursed for any of our investments in the hsp program since we reacquired the program from medimmune az in december in addition  we exceeded the contractually budgeted amount for research and development funding from purdue and mundipharma due primarily to the license of our pik inhibitor program from intellikine 
our cash used in operating activities for the period ended december  includes a million license payment for our pik program 
in addition  the change in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities for the year ended december  includes an additional license payment of million paid in january for our pik program as well as an increase in our contingent cash compensation program and an increase to our clinical studies accrual 
the change in deferred revenue for the year ended december  is primarily due to the amortization of million to license revenue 
cash flows from operations in future periods can vary significantly due to the level of research and development reimbursement or future collaboration arrangements 
for example  in  we expect to exceed the contractually budgeted amount for research and development funding from purdue and mundipharma 

table of contents in november  we entered into strategic alliances with mundipharma and purdue and issued four million shares of our common stock to purdue and one of its independent associated companies for cash proceeds of million 
of this amount  the shares were recorded at million  which represents the fair market value of our issued common stock and recorded in our cash flows from financing activities and million was accounted for as an up front license fee in deferred revenue and recorded in our cash flows from operating activities 
during january  we issued to purdue and one of its independent associated companies an aggregate of two million shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase up to six million shares of our common stock for cash proceeds of million 
these securities were recorded at their fair value of million and reflected as cash flows from financing activities 
the balance of million was accounted for as an up front license fee in deferred revenue and recorded in our cash flows from operating activities 
during the year ended december   we collected all of our unbilled receivables from purdue  mundipharma and medimmune az 
our reacquisition of the hsp program from medimmune az in december resulted in a million decrease in deferred revenue 
in february  novartis chose not to exercise its options for two one year extensions of the research period under our bcl collaboration  resulting in an million decrease in deferred revenue 
our investing activities for the years ended december   and include the purchase of and proceeds from maturities and sales of available for sale securities and purchases of property and equipment 
net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  included million in purchases of available for sale securities  proceeds of million from maturities of available for sale securities and proceeds of million from sales of available for sale securities 
capital expenditures in the year ended december  of million primarily consisted of laboratory equipment and software 
we will need substantial additional funds to support our planned operations 
we expect to receive up to million and million in contractually committed research and development funding under our strategic alliance with mundipharma for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in the absence of additional funding or business development activities and based on our current operating plans  we expect that our current cash and investments  together with research and development funding from purdue and mundipharma and the million line of credit that has been made available to us by pplp  are sufficient to fund our planned operations into we expect to draw down on the million line of credit by march  we may  however  need to raise additional funds before that date if our research and development expenses exceed our current expectations  if we do not receive the payments we expect to receive from mundipharma and purdue  if we acquire a third party or if we acquire or license rights to additional drug candidates or new technologies from one or more third parties 
we may need to raise additional funds for other reasons  including if our drug candidates require more extensive clinical or preclinical testing than we currently expect  we advance more of our drug candidates than expected into costly later stage clinical trials  we advance more preclinical drug candidates than expected into early stage clinical trials  the cost of acquiring raw materials for  and of manufacturing  our drug candidates is higher than anticipated  we are required  or consider it advisable  to acquire or license intellectual property rights from one or more third parties  mundipharma or purdue elects to discontinue its participation in a partnered program  or we experience a loss in our investments due to general market conditions or other reasons 

table of contents we may seek additional funding through public or private financings of equity or debt securities  but such financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  particularly in light of current market conditions 
in addition  the terms of our financings may be dilutive to  or otherwise adversely affect  holders of our common stock  and such terms may impact our ability to make capital expenditures or incur additional debt 
we may also seek additional funds through arrangements with collaborators or other third parties  or through project financing 
these arrangements would generally require us to relinquish or encumber rights to some of our technologies or drug candidates  and we may not be able to enter into such agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding on a timely basis  we may be required to curtail or terminate some or all of our product development programs 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual obligations payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total and beyond capital lease  including interest software contract obligation license fee to intellikine operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations the above table does not include contracts with contract research organizations as they are generally cancellable  with notice  at our option 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet financing activities  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant impact on our revenues or results of operations since inception 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since a significant portion of our investments are in money market funds  corporate obligations  and us government sponsored enterprise obligations 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december   as compared to an approximate  decrease as of december  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a change in market interest rates on our investments
