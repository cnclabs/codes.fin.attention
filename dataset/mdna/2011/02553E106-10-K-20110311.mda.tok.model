com  the expected payment of a dividend in future periods  the possibility of engaging in future franchise agreements  growth through acquisitions  and or internally developing additional new brands  the possibility that our credit facilities may not be available for future borrowings  the possibility that rising prices of raw materials  labor  energy and other inputs to our manufacturing process  if unmitigated  will have a significant impact to our profitability  and the possibility that we may be required to take store impairment charges related to underperforming stores 
we caution that these forward looking statements  and those described elsewhere in this report  involve material risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on factors beyond our control  as discussed within part i  item a of this form k 
accordingly  our future performance and financial results may differ materially from those expressed or implied in any such forward looking statement 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported financial condition and results of operations should actual results differ from these estimates 
we base our estimates and assumptions on the best available information and believe them to be reasonable for the circumstances 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue for store sales upon the purchase of merchandise by customers 
our e commerce operation records revenue upon the estimated customer receipt date of the merchandise 
revenue is not recorded on the purchase of gift cards 
a current liability is recorded upon purchase  and revenue is recognized when the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
revenue is recorded net of estimated and actual sales returns and deductions for coupon redemptions and other promotions 
the estimated sales return reserve is based on projected merchandise returns determined through the use of historical average return percentages 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our sales return reserve 
however  if the actual rate of sales returns increases significantly  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we estimate gift card breakage and recognize revenue in proportion to actual gift card redemptions as a component of net sales 
we determine an estimated gift card breakage rate by continuously evaluating historical redemption data and the time when there is a remote likelihood that a gift card will be redeemed 
merchandise inventory 
merchandise inventory is valued at the lower of average cost or market  utilizing the retail method 
average cost includes merchandise design and sourcing costs and related expenses 
the company records merchandise receipts at the time merchandise is delivered to the foreign shipping port by the manufacturer fob port 
this is the point at which title and risk of loss transfer to the company 
we review our inventory in order to identify slow moving merchandise and generally use markdowns to clear merchandise 
additionally  we estimate a markdown reserve for future planned markdowns related to current inventory 
if inventory exceeds customer demand for reasons of style  seasonal adaptation  changes in customer preference  lack of consumer acceptance of fashion items  competition  or if it is determined that the inventory in stock will not sell at its currently ticketed price  additional markdowns may be necessary 
these markdowns may have a material adverse impact on earnings  depending on the extent and amount of inventory affected 
we estimate an inventory shrinkage reserve for anticipated losses for the period between the last physical count and the balance sheet date 
the estimate for the shrinkage reserve is calculated based on historical percentages and 
table of contents can be affected by changes in merchandise mix and changes in actual shrinkage trends 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the future estimates or assumptions we use to calculate our inventory shrinkage reserve 
however  if actual physical inventory losses differ significantly from our estimate  our operating results could be adversely affected 
asset impairment 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standard codification asc  property  plant  and equipment  we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
assets are evaluated for impairment by comparing the projected undiscounted future cash flows of the asset  over its remaining useful life  to the carrying value 
if the future undiscounted cash flows are projected to be less than the carrying value of the asset  we adjust the asset value to its estimated fair value and an impairment loss is recorded as a component of operating income within selling  general and administrative expense 
our impairment loss calculations require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values  including forecasting useful lives of the assets and selecting the discount rate that reflects the risk inherent in future cash flows 
we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that there will be a material change in the estimates or assumptions we use to calculate long lived asset impairment losses 
however  if actual results are not consistent with our estimates and assumptions  our operating results could be adversely affected 
investment securities 
in accordance with asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc  we measure our investment securities using level  level and level inputs 
level and level inputs are valued using quoted market prices while we use a discounted cash flow dcf model to determine the fair value of our level investments 
the assumptions in our dcf model include different recovery periods depending on the type of security and varying discount factors for yield and illiquidity 
these assumptions are subjective and they are based on our current judgment and our view of current market conditions 
the use of different assumptions would result in a different valuation and related charge 
future adverse changes in market conditions  continued poor operating results of underlying investments or other factors could result in further losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  possibly requiring an additional net impairment loss recognized in earnings in the future 
we evaluate our investments for impairment in accordance with asc  investments debt and equity securities asc 
asc provides guidance for determining when an investment is considered impaired  whether impairment is other than temporary  and measurement of an impairment loss 
an investment is considered impaired if the fair value of the investment is less than its cost 
if  after consideration of all available evidence to evaluate the realizable value of its investment  impairment is determined to be other than temporary  then an impairment loss is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations equal to the difference between the investment s cost and its fair value 
as of may   we adopted asc  transition related to fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments asc  which modifies the requirements for recognizing other than temporary impairment otti and changes the impairment model for debt securities 
in addition  asc requires additional disclosures relating to debt and equity securities both in the interim and annual periods as well as requires the company to present total otti in the consolidated statements of operations  with an offsetting reduction for any non credit loss impairment amount recognized in other comprehensive income oci 
share based payments 
we account for share based payments in accordance with the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation asc 
to determine the fair value of our stock option awards  we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires management to apply judgment and make assumptions to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them the expected term and the estimated volatility of the price of our common stock over the expected term 
we calculate a weighted average expected term based on historical experience 
expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility 
we chose to use a combination of historical and implied volatility as we believe that this combination is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of 
table of contents the fair value of our share based payments and the related amount recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes 
we calculate income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes asc  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases as computed pursuant to asc deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates  based on certain judgments regarding enacted tax laws and published guidance  in effect in the years when those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established against the deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred taxes may not be realized 
changes in our level and composition of earnings  tax laws or the deferred tax valuation allowance  as well as the results of tax audits  may materially impact the effective income tax rate 
we evaluate our income tax positions in accordance with asc which prescribes a comprehensive model for recognizing  measuring  presenting and disclosing in the financial statements tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  including a decision whether to file or not to file in a particular jurisdiction 
under asc  a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable based on its technical merits 
the calculation of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  as well as the decision to recognize a tax benefit from an uncertain position and to establish a valuation allowance require management to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that our assumptions and estimates are reasonable  although actual results may have a positive or negative material impact on the balances of deferred tax assets and liabilities  valuation allowances or net income 
key performance indicators our management evaluates the following items  which are considered key performance indicators  in assessing our performance comparable store sales comparable store sales provide a measure of sales growth for stores open at least one year over the comparable prior year period 
in fiscal years following those with weeks  including fiscal  the prior year period is shifted by one week to compare similar calendar weeks 
a store is included in comparable store sales in the thirteenth month of operation 
however  stores that have a gross square footage increase of or greater due to a remodel are removed from the comparable store sales base  but are included in total sales 
these stores are returned to the comparable store sales base in the thirteenth month following the remodel 
sales from american eagle and aerie stores are included in comparable store sales 
sales from aeo direct are not included in comparable store sales 
sales from kids stores will be included in comparable store sales upon achieving months of operations 
our management considers comparable store sales to be an important indicator of our current performance 
comparable store sales results are important to achieve leveraging of our costs  including store payroll  store supplies  rent  etc 
comparable store sales also have a direct impact on our total net sales  cash and working capital 
gross profit gross profit measures whether we are optimizing the price and inventory levels of our merchandise and achieving an optimal level of sales 
gross profit is the difference between net sales and cost of sales 
cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  including design  sourcing  importing and inbound freight costs  as well as markdowns  shrinkage  certain promotional costs and buying  occupancy and warehousing costs 
buying  occupancy and warehousing costs consist of compensation  employee benefit expenses and travel for our buyers and certain senior merchandising executives  rent and utilities related to our stores  corporate headquarters  distribution centers and other office space  freight from our distribution centers to the stores  compensation and supplies for our distribution centers  including purchasing  receiving and inspection costs  and shipping and handling costs related to our e commerce operation 
the inability to obtain acceptable levels of sales  initial markups or any significant increase in our use of markdowns could have an adverse effect on our gross profit and results of operations 

table of contents operating income our management views operating income as a key indicator of our success 
the key drivers of operating income are comparable store sales  gross profit  our ability to control selling  general and administrative expenses and our level of capital expenditures 
store productivity store productivity  including net sales per average square foot  sales per productive hour  average unit retail price  conversion rate  the number of transactions per store  the number of units sold per store and the number of units per transaction  is evaluated by our management in assessing our operational performance 
inventory turnover our management evaluates inventory turnover as a measure of how productively inventory is bought and sold 
inventory turnover is important as it can signal slow moving inventory 
this can be critical in determining the need to take markdowns on merchandise 
cash flow and liquidity our management evaluates cash flow from operations  investing and financing in determining the sufficiency of our cash position 
cash flow from operations has historically been sufficient to cover our uses of cash 
our management believes that cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund anticipated capital expenditures and working capital requirements 
results of operations overview in fiscal  we took action to strategically manage our business in what continued to be a challenging retail environment 
during the second quarter  we commenced our corporate profit initiative  aimed at reducing costs  creating efficiencies and improving inventory turns 
additionally  we have strengthened our assortments and realigned talent 
we continue to make progress implementing our corporate profit initiatives  and are driving positive changes across the company  including supply chain and production operations 
fiscal net sales of billion increased compared to billion in fiscal annual comparable store sales decreased  compared to a decline last year 
a higher merchandise margin reflected lower markdowns 
however  buying  occupancy and warehousing expenses increased as a rate to sales as a result of negative comparable store sales and the impact of new store openings 
total selling  general and administrative expenses decreased due to a combination of lower incentive compensation expense recorded in the year and savings resulting from our corporate profit initiative 
operating income increased as a percent to net sales to for fiscal compared to for fiscal for fiscal  income from continuing operations was million and includes million of realized losses from the sale of investment securities 
as a percent to net sales  income from continuing operations was during fiscal and during fiscal fiscal income from continuing operations per diluted share was  which includes a per diluted share loss from sale of investment securities

realized loss on sale of investment securities the realized loss on sale of investment securities was million  or approximately per diluted share  for fiscal this compares to a loss of million  or per diluted share  last year 
the loss in fiscal was primarily due to the liquidation of of our auction rate security ars investment portfolio 
our ars investment portfolio was originally purchased as highly liquid short term instruments 
due to the deterioration of the ars market and ars investments experiencing failed auctions or long term auction resets  our ars investment portfolio was subsequently classified as long term  with a weighted average contractual maturity of approximately years 
this liquidation allowed us to convert substantially our entire ars investment portfolio to short term liquid assets  with total cash proceeds of million plus accrued interest and a net realized loss of million for the liquidation 
additionally  in the first half of fiscal  we liquidated million of ars investments for proceeds of million and a total realized loss of million 
net impairment loss recognized in earnings net impairment loss recognized in earnings relating to our investment securities was million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal provision for income taxes the effective income tax rate from continuing operations increased to approximately in fiscal from in fiscal the lower effective income tax rate in fiscal was primarily the result of the tax benefit associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings from canada as well as federal and state income tax settlements and other changes in income tax reserves 
additionally  the fiscal effective income tax rate was higher due to losses on the sale of certain ars investments in which no income tax benefit was recognized 
the repatriation of foreign earnings from canada in fiscal was a discrete event and has not changed the company s intention to indefinitely reinvest the earnings of our canadian subsidiaries to the extent not repatriated

fair value measurements asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under asc as the exit price associated with the sale of an asset or transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
financial instruments valuation techniques used to measure fair value under asc must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
in addition  asc establishes this three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs ie  projections  estimates  interpretations  etc 
that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
as of january   we held certain assets that are required to be measured at fair value on a recurring basis 
these include cash equivalents and short and long term investments  including ars 

table of contents in accordance with asc  the following table represents the fair value hierarchy for our financial assets cash equivalents and investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of january  fair value measurements at january  quoted market prices in active significant markets for significant other unobservable identical assets observable inputs inputs carrying amount level level level in thousands cash and cash equivalents cash commercial paper corporate bonds treasury bills money market total cash and cash equivalents short term investments term deposits state and local government ars total short term investments long term investments state and local government ars ars call option total long term investments total percent to total we used a discounted cash flow dcf model to value our level investments 
for fiscal  the assumptions in our model included different recovery periods  ranging from five to months  depending on the type of security  and discount factors for yield of and illiquidity of 
these assumptions are subjective 
they are based on our current judgment and our view of current market conditions 
the use of different assumptions would result in a different valuation 
for example  an increase in the recovery period by one year would reduce the fair value of our investment in ars by approximately million 
an increase to the discount rate and illiquidity premium of basis points would reduce the estimated fair value of our investment in auction rate securities by approximately million 
the fair value of the ars call option described in note to the consolidated financial statements was also estimated using a discounted cash flow model 
the model considered potential changes in yields for securities with similar characteristics to the underlying ars and evaluated possible future refinancing opportunities of the issuers of the ars 
the analysis then assessed the likelihood that the options would be exercisable as a result of the underlying ars being redeemed or traded in a secondary market at an amount greater than the exercise price prior to the end of the option term 
future changes in the fair values of the ars call option will be recorded within the consolidated statements of operations 
refer to notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on our investment securities  including a description of the securities and a discussion of the uncertainties relating to their liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources our uses of cash are generally for working capital  the construction of new stores and remodeling of existing stores  information technology upgrades  distribution center improvements and expansion  the purchase of both short and long term investments  the repurchase of common stock and the payment of dividends 
historically  these 
table of contents uses of cash have been funded with cash flow from operations and existing cash on hand 
additionally  our uses of cash include the development of aerie by american eagle and kids by american eagle 
we expect to be able to fund our future cash requirements through current cash holdings as well as cash generated from operations 
in the future  we expect that our uses of cash will also include further development of aerie by american eagle and kids by american eagle 
our growth strategy includes internally developing new brands and the possibility of further international expansion or acquisitions 
we periodically consider and evaluate these options to support future growth 
in the event we do pursue such options  we could require additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that we would be successful in closing any potential transaction  or that any endeavor we undertake would increase our profitability 
the following sets forth certain measures of our liquidity january  january  working capital in s current ratio the increase in our working capital and current ratio as of january   compared to january   is primarily related to the combined increase in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments as a result of cash generated from operations as well as the liquidation of long term investments  partially offset by share repurchases  cash dividends paid and capital expenditures 
additionally  current liabilities are lower due to the repayment of our outstanding notes payable balance in fiscal and a lower accrued compensation balance this year 
cash flows from operating activities of continuing operations net cash provided by operating activities totaled million during fiscal compared to million during fiscal and million during fiscal our major source of cash from operations was merchandise sales 
our primary outflows of cash from operations were for operational costs 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal was driven by an increase in income from continuing operations adjusted for non cash items and a reduction in inventory levels 
this was partially offset by a decrease in accrued compensation due to the payment of incentive compensation accrued during fiscal  as well as an increase in prepaid expenses due to the timing of payments 
cash flows from investing activities of continuing operations investing activities for fiscal included million of proceeds from the sale of investments classified as available for sale  partially offset by million used for capital expenditures and million for the purchase of short term investments 
investing activities for fiscal included million for capital expenditures  partially offset by million from the sale of investments classified as available for sale 
investing activities for fiscal primarily included million from the net sale of investments classified as available for sale  partially offset by million for capital expenditures

during fiscal  cash used for financing activities resulted primarily from million used for the payment of dividends and the partial repayment of million in borrowings against our demand line of credit 
during fiscal  cash used for financing activities resulted primarily from million used for the payment of dividends partially offset by million in borrowings against our demand line of credit 
asc requires that cash flows resulting from the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost for share based payments be classified as financing cash flows 
accordingly  for fiscal 
table of contents fiscal and  the excess tax benefit from share based payments of million  million and million  respectively  are classified as financing cash flows
