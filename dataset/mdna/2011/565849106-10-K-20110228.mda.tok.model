general marathon oil corporation was originally organized in as usx holdco  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the former usx corporation 
as a result of a reorganization completed in july  usx holdco  inc became the parent entity of the consolidated enterprise the former usx corporation was merged into a subsidiary of usx holdco  inc and changed its name to usx corporation 
in connection with the transaction described in the next paragraph the usx separation  usx corporation changed its name to marathon oil corporation 
before december   marathon had two outstanding classes of common stock usx marathon group common stock  which was intended to reflect the performance of our energy business  and usx us steel group common stock steel stock  which was intended to reflect the performance of our steel business 
on december   we disposed of our steel business through a tax free distribution of the common stock of our wholly owned subsidiary united states steel corporation united states steel to holders of steel stock in exchange for all outstanding shares of steel stock on a one for one basis 
in connection with the usx separation  our certificate of incorporation was amended on december   and marathon has had only one class of common stock authorized since that date

the incident resulted in a significant oil spill in the gulf of mexico 
marathon had no involvement in the incident 
as a result of the deepwater horizon incident  the us department of the interior issued a drilling moratorium on may   to suspend the drilling of deepwater wells  and prohibit drilling any new deepwater wells defined as greater than foot water depth 
shortly after the moratorium was issued  we temporarily suspended drilling an exploratory well on the innsbruck prospect  located on mississippi canyon block although the drilling moratorium was lifted on october   it is not known when plans and permits will be approved for future deepwater drilling activity 
we sent a revised development operations coordination document for the ozona completion and a revised exploration plan for the innsbruck well to the bureau of ocean energy management regulation and enforcement boemre 
we continue to update our revised oil spill response plan as new and updated requirements come from the boemre 
we filed our first deepwater exploration plan since the deepwater horizon incident to the boemre on october  we are continuing to engage the boemre to provide them with all the requested information 
the boemre has not yet deemed our plan submitted

alba field natural gas is processed by the lpg plant under a long term contract at a fixed price for the british thermal units used in the operations of the lpg plant and for the hydrocarbons extracted from the natural gas stream in the form of secondary condensate and lpg 
during  a gross mmcfd of natural gas was supplied to the lpg production facility and the resulting net liquid hydrocarbon sales volumes in included mbpd of secondary condensate and mbpd of lpg produced by alba plant llc 
as part of our integrated gas segment  we own percent of atlantic methanol production company llc ampco and percent of equatorial guinea lng holdings limited egholdings  both of which are accounted for as equity method investments 
ampco operates a methanol plant and egholdings operates an lng production facility  both located on bioko island 
dry natural gas from the alba field  which remains after the condensate and lpg are removed  is supplied to both of these facilities under long term contracts at fixed prices 
because of the location of and limited local demand for natural gas in equatorial guinea  we consider the prices under the contracts with alba plant llc  ampco and egholdings to be comparable to the price that could be realized from transactions with unrelated parties in this market under the same or similar circumstances 
our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of secondary condensate and lpg produced by alba plant llc is reflected in our e p segment 
our share of the income ultimately generated by the subsequent export of methanol produced by ampco and lng produced by egholdings is reflected in our integrated gas segment as discussed below

the east brae platform hosts the nearby braemar field in which we have a percent working interest 
the strategic location of the brae platforms along with pipeline and onshore infrastructure has generated third party processing and transportation business since currently  the operators of third party fields have contracted to use the brae system 
most recently  in  we agreed to commence construction and installation of a new module to accommodate the tie back of the third party operated devenick field

the expanded upgrader began the commissioning and start up phase  which will continue into early stage debottlenecking activities are scheduled to begin in potential future expansions and additional debottlenecking opportunities remain under review 
a planned turnaround at the muskeg river mine and the upgrader occurred from march through may our net share of turnaround costs was million 
production as the aosp was halted in april before a staged resumption of operations in mid may current aosp operations use established processes to mine oil sands deposits from an open pit mine  extract the bitumen and upgrade it into synthetic crude oils 
ore is mined using traditional truck and shovel mining techniques 
the mined ore passes through primary crushers to reduce the ore chunks in size and is then sent to rotary breakers where the ore chunks are further reduced to smaller particles 
the particles are combined with hot water to create slurry 
the slurry moves through the extraction process where it separates into sand  clay and bitumen rich froth 
a solvent is added to the bitumen froth to separate out the remaining solids  water and heavy asphaltenes 
the solvent washes the sand and produces clean bitumen that is required for the upgrader to run efficiently 
the process yields a mixture of solvent and bitumen which is then transported from the mine to the scotford upgrader via the approximately mile corridor pipeline 
the bitumen is upgraded at scotford using both hydrotreating and hydroconversion processes to remove sulfur and break the heavy bitumen molecules into lighter products 
blendstocks acquired from outside sources are utilized in the production of our saleable products 
the three major products that the scotford upgrader produces are light synthetic crude oil  heavy synthetic crude oil and vacuum gas oil 
the vacuum gas oil is sold to an affiliate of the operator under a long term contract at market related prices  and the other products are sold in the marketplace 
the above discussion of the oil sands mining segment includes forward looking statements concerning the start up of the expanded upgrader 
factors which could affect this project include transportation logistics  availability of materials and labor  unforeseen hazards such as weather conditions and delays or other risks customarily associated with start up projects
