item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations effect of federal laws and regulations recent legislation impacting the financial services industry 
many aspects of the dodd frank act are subject to rulemaking and will take effect over several years  making it difficult to anticipate the overall financial impact on the company 
however  compliance with this new law and its implementing regulations will result in additional operating costs that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our exposure to operational risks may adversely affect us 
similar to other financial institutions  we are exposed to many types of operational risk  including reputational risk  legal and compliance risk  the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders  the risk that sensitive customer or company data is compromised  unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors  including clerical or record keeping errors 
if any of these risks occur  it could result in material adverse consequences for us 
we continually encounter technological change  and we may have fewer resources than many of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes  with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our clients 
as a service to our clients  we currently offer an internet pc banking product 
use of this service involves the transmission of confidential information over public networks 
we cannot be sure that advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not result in a compromise or breach in the commercially available encryption and authentication technology that we use to protect our clients transaction data 
if we were to experience such a breach or compromise  we could suffer losses and our operations could be adversely affected 
our accounting policies and methods impact how we report our financial condition and results of operations 
application of these policies and methods may require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain 
our accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives  any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in our reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our cons olidated financial statements contained in item of this report 
these accounting policies are critical to presenting our financial condition and results of operations 
they may require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain 
materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
changes in accounting standards could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting standard setters  including the financial accounting standards board  securities and exchange commission and other regulatory bodies  from time to time may change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively  resulting in changes to previously reported financial results  or a cumulative charge to retained earnings 
our controls and procedures may be ineffective 
we regularly review and update our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures 
as a result  we may incur increased costs to maintain and improve our controls and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls or procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
risks relating to our common stock the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly  and this may make it difficult for you to resell our common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive 
we cannot predict how our common stock will trade in the future 
the market value of our common stock will likely continue to fluctuate in response to a number of factors including the following  most of which are beyond our control  as well as the other factors described in this risk factors section actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating and financial results  developments related to investigations  proceedings or litigation that involve us  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by financial analysts  dispositions  acquisitions and financings  actions of our current stockholders  including sales of common stock by existing stockholders and our directors and executive officers  fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors  regulatory developments  and other developments related to the financial services industry 
the market value of our common stock may also be affected by conditions affecting the financial markets in general  including price and trading fluctuations 
these conditions may result in i volatility in the level of  and fluctuations in  the market prices of stocks generally and  in turn  our common stock and ii sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the market  in each case that could be unrelated or disproportionate to changes in our operating performance 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market value of our common stock 
our common stock also has a low average daily trading volume relative to many other stocks  which may limit an investor s ability to quickly accumulate or divest themselves of large blocks of our stock 
this can lead to sig nificant price swings even when a relatively small number of shares are being traded 
there may be future sales of additional common stock or other dilution of our equity  which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we are not restricted from issuing additional common stock or preferred stock  including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for  or that represent the right to receive  common stock or preferred stock or any substantially similar securities 
the market value of our common stock could decline as a result of sales by us of a large number of shares of common stock or preferred stock or similar securities in the market or the perception that such sales could occur 
our board of directors is authorized to cause us to issue additional common stock  as well as classes or series of preferred stock  generally without any action on the part of the stockholders 
in addition  the board has the power  generally without stockholder approval  to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights  dividend rights and preferences over the common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation  dissolution or winding up of our business and other terms 
if we issue preferred stock in the future that has a preference over the common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of the common stock  the rights of holders of the common stock or the market value of the common stock could be adversely affected 
regulatory and contractual restrictions may limit or prevent us from paying dividends on and repurchasing our common stock 
great southern bancorp  inc is an entity separate and distinct from its principal subsidiary  great southern bank  and derives substantially all of its revenue in the form of dividends from that subsidiary 
accordingly  great southern bancorp  inc is and will be dependent upon dividends from the bank to pay the principal of and interest on its indebtedness  to satisfy its other cash needs and to pay dividends on its common and preferred stock 
the bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to its ability to earn net income and to meet certain regulatory requirements 
in the event the bank is unable to pay dividends to great southern bancorp  inc  great southern bancorp  inc may not be able to pay dividends on its common or preferred stock 
also  great southern bancorp  inc s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
this includes claims under the liquidation account maintained for the benefit of certain eligible deposit account holders of the bank established in connection with the bank s conversion from the mutual to the stock form of ownership 
the securities purchase agreement between us and the us treasury we entered into in connection with the tarp capital purchase program provides that prior to the earlier of i december  and ii the date on which all of the shares of the series a preferred stock we issued to the us treasury have been redeemed by us or transferred by the us treasury to third parties  we may not  without the consent of the us treasury  a increase the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock above per share or b subject to limited exceptions  redeem  repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or preferred stock other than the series a preferred stock or trust preferred securities 
we also are unable to pay any dividends on our common stock unless we are cur rent in our dividend payments on the series a preferred stock 
in addition  as described below in the next risk factor  the terms of our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities prohibit us from paying dividends on or repurchasing our common stock at any time when we have elected to defer the payment of interest on such debt securities or certain events of default under the terms of those debt securities have occurred and are continuing 
these restrictions  together with the potentially dilutive impact of the warrant we issued to the us treasury described below  could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock 
moreover  holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when  as and if declared by our board of directors 
although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock  we are not required to do so and our board of directors could reduce  suspend or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future 
if we defer payments of interest on our outstanding junior subordinated debt securities or if certain defaults relating to those debt securities occur  we will be prohibited from declaring or paying dividends or distributions on  and from making liquidation payments with respect to  our common stock 
as of december   we had outstanding million aggregate principal amount of junior subordinated debt securities issued in connection with the sale of trust preferred securities by certain of our subsidiaries that are statutory business trusts 
we have also guaranteed those trust preferred securities 
there are currently two separate series of these junior subordinated debt securities outstanding  each series having been issued under a separate indenture and with a separate guarantee 
each of these indentures  together with the related guarantee  prohibits us  subject to limited exceptions  from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on  or redeeming  repurchasing  acquiring or making any liquidation payments with respect to  any of our capital stock including the ser ies a preferred stock and our common stock at any time when i there shall have occurred and be continuing an event of default under the indenture or any event  act or condition that with notice or lapse of time or both would constitute an event of default under the indenture  or ii we are in default with respect to payment of any obligations under the related guarantee  or iii we have deferred payment of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities outstanding under that indenture 
in that regard  we are entitled  at our option but subject to certain conditions  to defer payments of interest on the junior subordinated debt securities of each series from time to time for up to five years 
events of default under each indenture generally consist of our failure to pay interest on the junior subordinated debt securities outstanding under that indenture under certain circumstances  our failure to pay any principal of or premium on such junior subordinated debt securities when due  our failure to comply with certain covenants under the indenture  and certain events of bankruptcy  insolvency or liquidation relating to us or great southern bank 
as a result of these provisions  if we were to elect to defer payments of interest on any series of junior subordinated debt securities  or if any of the other events described in clause i or ii of the first paragraph of this risk factor were to occur  we would be prohibited from declaring or paying any dividends on the series a preferred stock and our common stock  from redeeming  repurchasing or otherwise acquiring any of the series a preferred stock or our common stock  and from making any payments to holders of the series a preferred stock or our common stock in the event of our liquidation  which would likely have a material adverse effect on the market value of our common stock 
moreover  without notice to or consent from the holders of our common stock or the series a preferred stock  we may issu e additional series of junior subordinated debt securities in the future with terms similar to those of our existing junior subordinated debt securities or enter into other financing agreements that limit our ability to purchase or to pay dividends or distributions on our capital stock  including our common stock 
our series a preferred stock impacts net income available to our common stockholders and earnings per common share  and the warrant we issued to the us treasury may be dilutive to holders of our common stock 
the dividends declared on our series a preferred stock reduce the net income available to common stockholders and our earnings per common share 
the series a preferred stock will also receive preferential treatment in the event of liquidation  dissolution or winding up of great southern bancorp  inc additionally  the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the warrant we issued to the us treasury in conjunction with the sale to the us treasury of the series a preferred stock is exercised 
the  shares of common stock underlying the warrant represented approximately of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of december  including the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant in total shares outs tanding 
although the us treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant  a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant is not bound by this restriction 
if we are unable to redeem our series a preferred stock after five years  the cost of this capital to us will increase substantially 
if we are unable to redeem our series a preferred stock prior to february   the cost of this capital to us will increase substantially on that date  from per annum approximately million annually to per annum approximately million annually 
depending on our financial condition at the time  this increase in the annual dividend rate on the series a preferred stock could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
holders of the series a preferred stock have limited voting rights 
until and unless we are in arrears on our dividend payments on the series a preferred stock for six dividend periods  whether or not consecutive  the holders of the series a preferred stock will have no voting rights except with respect to certain fundamental changes in the terms of the series a preferred stock and certain other matters and except as may be required by maryland law 
if  however  dividends on the series a preferred stock are not paid in full for six dividend periods  whether or not consecutive  the total number of positions on the great southern bancorp board of directors will automatically increase by two and the holders of the series a preferred stock  acting as a class with any other parity securities having similar voting rights  will have the right to elect two individuals to serve in the new director positions 
this right and the terms of such directors will end when we have paid in full all accrued and unpaid dividends for all past dividend periods 
the voting limitation provision in our charter could limit your voting rights as a holder of our common stock 
our charter provides that any person or group who acquires beneficial ownership of our common stock in excess of of the outstanding shares may not vote the excess shares 
accordingly  if you acquire beneficial ownership of more than of the outstanding shares of our common stock  your voting rights with respect to the common stock will not be commensurate with your economic interest in our company 
anti takeover provisions could adversely impact our stockholders 
provisions in our charter and bylaws  the corporate law of the state of maryland and federal regulations could delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us  despite the possible benefit to our stockholders  or otherwise adversely affect the market price of any class of our equity securities  including our common stock 
these provisions include a prohibition on voting shares of common stock beneficially owned in excess of of total shares outstanding  supermajority voting requirements for certain business combinations with any person who beneficially owns or more of our outstanding common stock  the election of directors to staggered terms of three years  advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors and for proposing matters that stockholders may act on at st ockholder meetings  a requirement that only directors may fill a vacancy in our board of directors  and supermajority voting requirements to remove any of our directors 
our charter also authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock  and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal 
in addition  because we are a bank holding company  purchasers of or more of our common stock may be required to obtain approvals under the change in bank control act of  as amended  or the bank holding company act of  as amended and in certain cases such approvals may be required at a lesser percentage of ownership 
specifically  under regulations adopted by the federal reserve board  a any other bank holding company may be required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve board to acquire or retain or more of our common stock and b any person other than a bank holding company may be required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve board to acquire or retain or more of our common stock 
these provisions may discourage potential takeover attempts  discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over market price or adversely affect the market price of  and the voting and other rights of the holders of  our common stock 
these provisions also could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to elect directors other than the candidates nominated by our board of directors
