table of contents item a 
risk factors the ownership of our common stock involves a number of risks and uncertainties 
potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and the other information in this annual report on form k before deciding whether to invest in our securities 
our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks 
the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks that are currently unknown to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial may also impair our business or adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
risks relating to our business we are subject to risks related to our dependence on the strength of retail economies in various parts of the world and our performance may be affected by general economic conditions and the current global financial crisis 
the company s business depends on the strength of the retail economies in various parts of the world  primarily in north america and to a lesser extent asia  central and south america and europe  which have recently deteriorated significantly and may remain depressed  or be subject to further deterioration  for the foreseeable future 
these retail economies are affected primarily by factors such as consumer demand and the condition of the retail industry  which  in turn  are affected by general economic conditions and specific events such as natural disasters  terrorist attacks and political unrest 
the impact of these external factors is difficult to predict  and one or more of the factors could adversely impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
purchases of many consumer products are discretionary and tend to be highly correlated with the cycles of the levels of disposable income of consumers 
as a result  any substantial deterioration in general economic conditions could adversely affect consumer spending patterns  our sales and our results of operations 
in particular  decreased consumer confidence or a reduction in discretionary income as a result of unfavorable macroeconomic conditions may negatively affect our business 
if the current macroeconomic environment persists or worsens  consumers may reduce or delay their purchases of our products 
any such reduction in purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in the retail industry and markets for consumer products affecting our customers or retailing practices could negatively impact existing customer relationships and our results of operations 
we sell our outdoor solutions  consumer solutions and branded consumables products to retailers  including club  department store  drug  grocery  mass merchant  sporting goods and specialty retailers  as well as direct to consumers 
a significant deterioration in the financial condition of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
we regularly monitor and evaluate the credit status of our customers and attempt to adjust sales terms as appropriate 
despite these efforts  a bankruptcy filing by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  as a result of the desire of retailers to more closely manage inventory levels  there is a growing trend among retailers to make purchases on a just in time basis 
this requires us to shorten our lead time for production in certain cases and more closely anticipate demand  which could in the future require us to carry additional inventories 
we may be negatively affected by changes in the policies of our retailer customers  such as inventory destocking  limitations on access to and time on shelf space  use of private label brands  price demands  payment terms and other conditions  which could negatively impact our results of operations 

table of contents there is a growing trend among retailers in the us and in foreign markets to undergo changes that could decrease the number of stores that carry our products or increase the concentration of ownership within the retail industry  including consolidating their operations  undergoing restructurings or store closings  undergoing reorganizations  or realigning their affiliations 
these consolidations could result in a shift of bargaining power to the retail industry and in fewer outlets for our products 
further consolidations could result in price and other competition that could reduce our margins and our net sales 
our sales are highly dependent on purchases from several large customers and any significant decline in these purchases or pressure from these customers to reduce prices could have a negative effect on our future financial performance 
due to consolidation in the us retail industry  our customer base has become relatively concentrated 
in  one customer  walmart  accounted for approximately of our consolidated net sales 
although we have long established relationships with many of our customers  we do not have any long term supply or binding contracts or guarantees of minimum purchases 
purchases by our customers are generally made using individual purchase orders 
as a result  these customers may cancel their orders  change purchase quantities from forecast volumes  delay purchases for a number of reasons beyond our control or change other terms of our business relationship 
significant or numerous cancellations  reductions  delays in purchases or changes in business practices or by customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  because many of our costs are fixed  a reduction in customer demand could have an adverse effect on our gross profit margins and operating income 
we depend on a continuous flow of new orders from our large  high volume retail customers  however  we may be unable to continually meet the needs of our customers 
furthermore  on time delivery and satisfactory customer service are becoming increasingly important to our customers 
retailers are increasing their demands on suppliers to reduce lead times for product delivery  which may require us to increase inventories and could impact the timing of reported sales  improve customer service  such as with direct import programs  whereby product is supplied directly to retailers from third party suppliers  and adopt new technologies related to inventory management such as radio frequency identification  otherwise known as rfid  technology  which may have substantial implementation costs 
we cannot provide any assurance that we can continue to successfully meet the needs of our customers 
a substantial decrease in sales to any of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
changes in foreign  cultural  political and financial market conditions could impair our international operations and financial performance 
some of our operations are conducted or products are sold in countries where economic growth has slowed  such as japan  or where economies have suffered economic  social and or political instability or hyperinflation or where the ability to repatriate funds has been delayed or impaired in recent years  such as venezuela and mexico 

table of contents current government economic and fiscal policies  including stimulus measures and currency exchange rates and controls  in these economies may not be sustainable and  as a result  our sales or profits related to those countries may decline 
the economies of other foreign countries important to our operations  including other countries in asia  europe and latin america  could also suffer slower economic growth or economic  social and or political instability or hyperinflation in the future 
international operations  including manufacturing and sourcing operations and the international operations of our customers  are subject to inherent risks which could adversely affect us  including  among other things protectionist policies restricting or impairing the manufacturing  sales or import and export of our products  new restrictions on access to markets  lack of developed infrastructure  inflation including hyperinflation or recession  devaluations or fluctuations in the value of currencies  changes in and the burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations  including tax laws  accounting standards  environmental laws and occupational health and safety laws  social  political or economic instability  acts of war and terrorism  natural disasters or other crises  reduced protection of intellectual property rights in some countries  increases in duties and taxation  restrictions on transfer of funds and or exchange of currencies  expropriation of assets  and other adverse changes in policies  including monetary  tax and or lending policies  encouraging foreign investment or foreign trade by our host countries 
should any of these risks occur  our ability to sell or export our products or repatriate profits could be impaired  we could experience a loss of sales and profitability from our international operations  and or we could experience a substantial impairment or loss of assets  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business 
currency devaluations or fluctuations may significantly increase our expenses and affect our results of operations as well as the carrying value of international assets on our balance sheet  especially where the currency is subject to intense political and other outside pressure  such as in the case of the venezuelan bolivar and the chinese renminbi 
while we transact business predominantly in us dollars and most of our revenues are collected in us dollars  a substantial portion of our assets  revenues  costs  such as payroll  rent and indirect operational costs  and earnings are denominated in other currencies  such as the chinese renminbi  venezuelan bolivar  european euro  japanese yen  mexican peso  and british pound 
changes in the relation of these and other currencies to the us dollar will affect the carrying value of our international assets as well as our sales and profitability and could result in exchange losses 
for example  a stronger mexican peso would mean our products assembled or produced in mexico would be more expensive to import into the us or other countries  thereby reducing profitability of those products 
likewise  if the government of china allowed the chinese renminbi to rise substantially versus the us dollar  the cost of our products produced in china would rise 
in  venezuela was designated a hyper inflationary economy  and the venezuelan government devalued its currency 

table of contents consequently  the company changed the functional currency of the company s subsidiary in venezuela from the venezuelan bolivar to the us dollar and recorded an accounting charge against earnings relating to foreign exchange translation as a result of the hyperinflationary status 
the company will continue to recognize in our income statement any differences that may arise from the remeasurement of us dollar denominated assets and liabilities at the parallel market rate and their subsequent translation for financial reporting purposes at the official rate  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  the devaluation of  and any future devaluation of the venezuelan bolivar  will negatively impact the carrying value of our assets in venezuela and our results of operations because the earnings and assets of our venezuelan operations will be reduced when translated into us dollars 
as the company has substantial operations and assets located outside the united states  foreign currency devaluations or fluctuations in the applicable foreign currency exchange rates in relation to the us dollar could continue to have a material adverse impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition  both for purposes of actual conversion and financial reporting purposes 
the impact of future exchange rate devaluations or fluctuations on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
there can be no assurance that the us dollar foreign exchange rates will be stable in the future or that fluctuations in financial or foreign markets will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our failure to generate sufficient cash to meet our liquidity needs may affect our ability to service our indebtedness and grow our business 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness  including any of our debt securities and amounts borrowed under our senior secured credit facility  and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and strategic acquisitions we may make in the future  if any  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations  together with available cash and available borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  will be adequate to meet future liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future  that our currently anticipated growth in revenues and cash flow will be realized on schedule or that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to service indebtedness  including any of our debt securities  grow our business or to fund other liquidity needs 
we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness  including any of our debt securities and our senior secured credit facility  on or before maturity 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our indebtedness imposes constraints and requirements on our business and financial performance  and our compliance and performance in relationship to these could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
as of december   we had total indebtedness of approximately billion 
our significant indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and investments and other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the markets in which we operate  
table of contents adversely affect our ability to expand our business  market our products and make investments and capital expenditures  adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition strategy  place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limit  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds 
the terms of our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes due  our senior subordinated notes due  our senior notes due  and our senior notes due  will allow us to issue and incur additional debt upon satisfaction of certain conditions 
we anticipate that any future acquisitions we pursue as part of our growth strategy or potential stock repurchase programs may be financed through a combination of cash on hand  operating cash flow  availability under our existing credit facilities and new capital market offerings 
if new debt is added to current debt levels  the related risks described above could increase 
in addition  our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes due  our senior subordinated notes due  our senior notes due  and our senior notes due contain restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interests 
our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness 
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
borrowings under the revolving portion of our senior secured credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  and our net income and cash flows would decrease 
our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our senior subordinated notes due  our senior subordinated notes due  our senior notes due  and our senior notes due  contain various covenants which limit our management s discretion in the operation of our business and the failure to comply with such covenants could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our senior secured credit facility  the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes due  the indenture governing our senior subordinated notes due  the indenture governing our senior notes due  and the indenture governing our senior notes due contain various provisions that limit our management s discretion by restricting our and our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or distributions on  or redeem or repurchase  capital stock  make investments  engage in transactions with affiliates  incur liens  transfer or sell assets  and consolidate  merge or transfer all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  our senior secured credit facility requires us to meet certain financial ratios and other covenants 
any failure to comply with the restrictions of our senior secured credit facility and the indentures related to our 
table of contents notes or any other subsequent financing agreements may result in an event of default 
an event of default may allow the creditors  if the agreements so provide  to accelerate the related debt as well as any other debt to which a cross acceleration or cross default provision applies 
in addition  the lenders under our senior secured credit facility may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds 
furthermore  substantially all of our domestic assets including equity interests are pledged to secure our indebtedness under our senior secured credit facility 
if we default on the financial covenants in our senior secured credit facility  our lenders could foreclose on their security interest in such assets  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
instability in the credit markets may impede our ability to successfully access capital markets and ensure adequate liquidity 
in recent years  the global credit markets have experienced significant disruption and volatility as evidenced by a lack of liquidity in the debt capital markets  significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk in the broadly syndicated credit market and failure of certain major financial institutions 
as a result  in some cases  the ability or willingness of traditional sources of capital to provide financing has been reduced 
such market disruptions may continue  which could increase our cost of borrowing or affect our ability to access one or more financial markets 
if we are not able to access debt capital markets at competitive rates  our ability to implement our business plan and strategy will be negatively affected 
in particular  our account receivable securitization facility is designed to be a relatively short term facility 
if we are unable to refinance or replace this facility  our ability to manage our liquidity needs could be impaired which could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
our lenders may have suffered losses related to the weakening economy and may not be able to fund our borrowings 
our lenders  including the lenders participating in our senior secured credit facility  have suffered losses in recent years related to their lending and other financial relationships  especially because of the general weakening of the national economy since and increased financial instability of many borrowers 
there can be no assurance that additional lenders will not become insolvent or tighten their lending standards  which could make it more difficult for us to borrow under our credit facility or to obtain other financing on favorable terms or at all 
our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we were unable to draw funds under our credit facility because of a lender default or to obtain other cost effective financing 
if we fail to develop new or expand existing customer relationships  our ability to grow our business will be impaired 
our growth depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop new customer relationships and to expand existing relationships with current customers 
we cannot guarantee that new customers will be found  that any such new relationships will be successful when they are in place  or that business with current customers will increase 
failure to develop and expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results can be adversely affected by changes in the cost or availability of raw materials 
pricing and availability of raw materials for use in our businesses can be volatile due to numerous factors beyond our control  including general  domestic and international economic conditions  labor costs  production levels  competition  consumer demand  import duties and tariffs and currency exchange rates 
this volatility can significantly affect the availability and cost of raw materials for us  and may  therefore  have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents recently  the prices of many raw materials used in our businesses have been increasing 
during periods of rising prices of raw materials  there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass any portion of such increases on to customers 
conversely  when raw material prices decline  customer demands for lower prices could result in lower sale prices and  to the extent we have existing inventory  lower margins 
as a result  fluctuations in raw material prices could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
some of the products we manufacture require particular types of glass  metal  paper  plastic  wax  wood or other materials 
supply shortages for a particular type of material can delay production or cause increases in the cost of manufacturing our products 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
with the growing trend towards consolidation among suppliers of many of our raw materials  especially resin  glass and steel  we are increasingly dependent upon key suppliers whose bargaining strength is growing 
in addition  many of those suppliers have been reducing production capacity of those raw materials in the north american market 
we may be negatively affected by changes in availability and pricing of raw materials resulting from this consolidation and reduced capacity  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
seasonality and weather conditions may cause our operating results to vary from quarter to quarter 
sales of certain of our products are seasonal 
sales of our outdoor camping equipment  fishing equipment and sporting goods equipment products increase during warm weather months and decrease during winter  while sales of our skis  snowboards and snowshoes increase during the cold weather months and decrease during summer 
additionally  sales of our branded consumables products generally reflect the season  with sales of our home improvement products concentrated in the spring and summer months and sales of our firelogs and firestarters concentrated in the fall and winter months 
sales of our consumer solutions products generally are strongest in the fourth quarter preceding the holiday season 
weather conditions may also negatively impact sales 
for instance  fewer than anticipated natural disasters ie  hurricanes and ice storms could negatively affect the sale of certain outdoor recreation products  mild winter weather may negatively impact sales of our winter sports products  firelogs and firestarters  and certain personal care and wellness products  and the late arrival of summer weather may negatively impact sales of outdoor camping equipment  fishing equipment  sporting goods and water sports products 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we cannot continue to develop new products in a timely manner  and at favorable margins  we may not be able to compete effectively 
we believe that our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to continue to introduce innovative design extensions for our existing products and to develop  manufacture and market new products 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in the introduction  manufacturing and marketing of any new products or product innovations  or develop and introduce  in a timely manner  innovations to our existing products that satisfy customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
our failure to develop new products and introduce them successfully and in a timely manner  and at favorable margins  would harm our ability to successfully grow our business and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
competition in our industries may hinder our ability to execute our business strategy  achieve profitability  or maintain relationships with existing customers 
we operate in some highly competitive industries 
in these industries  we compete against numerous other domestic and foreign companies 
competition in the markets in which we operate is based primarily on product quality  product innovation  price and customer service and support  although the degree and nature of such competition vary by location and product line 
we also face competition from the manufacturing operations of some of our current and potential customers with private label or captive house brands 

table of contents some of our competitors are more established in their industries and have substantially greater revenue or resources than we do 
our competitors may take actions to match new product introductions and other initiatives 
since many of our competitors source their products from third parties  our ability to obtain a cost advantage through sourcing is reduced 
certain of our competitors may be willing to reduce prices and accept lower profit margins to compete with us 
further  retailers often demand that suppliers reduce their prices on existing products 
competition could cause price reductions  reduced profits or losses or loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
to compete effectively in the future in the consumer products industry  among other things  we must maintain strict quality standards  develop new products that appeal to consumers  and deliver products on a reliable basis at competitive prices 
our inability to do any of these things could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are subject to risks related to acquisitions  and our failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we have achieved growth through the acquisition of both relatively large and small companies 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to integrate successfully these businesses or future acquisitions into our existing business without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial difficulties 
there is also no assurance that we will be able to successfully leverage synergies among our businesses to increase sales and obtain cost savings 
additionally  the failure of these businesses to achieve expected results  diversion of our management s attention and failure to retain key personnel at these businesses could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we anticipate that any future acquisitions we pursue as part of our business strategy may be financed through a combination of cash on hand  operating cash flow  availability under our senior secured credit facility and new capital market offerings 
if new debt is added to current debt levels  or if we incur other liabilities  including contingent liabilities  in connection with an acquisition  the debt or liabilities could impose additional constraints and requirements on our business and financial performance  which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operations 
failure to successfully implement our reorganization and acquisition related projects timely and economically could materially increase our costs and impair our results of operations 
we are in the process of significant reorganization and acquisition related projects 
there can be no assurance that these projects can be completed on time or within our projected costs 
furthermore  these projects will result in an increased reliance on sourced finished goods from third parties  particularly international vendors 
our failure to implement these projects economically and successfully could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to several production related risks which could jeopardize our ability to realize anticipated sales and profits 
in order to realize sales and operating profits at anticipated levels  we must manufacture or source and deliver in a timely manner products of high quality 
among others  the following factors can have a negative effect on our ability to do these things labor difficulties  
table of contents scheduling and transportation difficulties  including the availability and cost of ocean freight containers  management dislocation  substandard product quality  which can result in higher warranty  product liability and product recall costs  delays in development of quality new products  changes in laws and regulations  including changes in tax rates  accounting standards  and environmental  safety and occupational laws  health and safety laws and regulations  and changes in the availability and costs of labor 
any adverse change in any of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because we manufacture or source a significant portion of our products from asia  our production lead times are relatively long 
therefore  we often commit to production in advance of firm customer orders 
if we fail to forecast customer or consumer demand accurately we may encounter difficulties in filling customer orders or in liquidating excess inventories  or may find that customers are canceling orders or returning products 
additionally  changes in retailer inventory management strategies could make inventory management more difficult 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operations are dependent upon third party vendors and suppliers whose failure to perform adequately could disrupt our business operations 
we currently source a significant portion of parts and products from third parties 
our ability to select and retain reliable vendors and suppliers who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact our success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products 
we typically do not enter into long term contracts with our primary vendors and suppliers 
instead  most parts and products are supplied on a purchase order basis 
as a result  we may be subject to unexpected changes in pricing or supply of products 
in addition  the financial condition of our vendors and suppliers may be adversely affected by general economic conditions  such as the credit crisis and turbulent macroeconomic environment in recent years should any of these parties fail to manufacture sufficient supply  go out of business or discontinue a particular component  we may not be able to find alternative vendors and suppliers in a timely manner  if at all 
any inability of our vendors and suppliers to timely deliver quality parts and products or any unanticipated change in supply  quality or pricing of products could be disruptive and costly to us 
our reliance on manufacturing facilities and suppliers in asia could make us vulnerable to supply interruptions related to the political  legal and cultural environment in asia 
a significant portion of our products are manufactured by third party suppliers in asia  primarily the people s republic of china  or at our own facilities in southern china 
our ability to continue to select reliable vendors who provide timely deliveries of quality parts and products will impact our success in meeting customer demand for timely delivery of quality products 
furthermore  the ability of our own facilities to timely deliver finished goods  and the ability of third party suppliers to timely deliver finished goods and or raw materials  may be affected by events beyond their control  such as inability of shippers to timely deliver merchandise due to work stoppages or slowdowns  or significant weather and health conditions such as sars affecting manufacturers and or shippers 
any adverse change in  among other things  any of the following could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition our relationship with third party suppliers  
table of contents the financial condition of third party suppliers  our ability to import products from these third party suppliers or our own facilities  or third party suppliers ability to manufacture and deliver outsourced products on a timely basis 
we cannot assure you that we could quickly or effectively replace any of our suppliers if the need arose  and we cannot assure you that we could retrieve tooling and molds possessed by any of our third party suppliers 
our dependence on these few suppliers could also adversely affect our ability to react quickly and effectively to changes in the market for our products 
in addition  international manufacturing is subject to significant risks  including  among other things labor unrest  social  political and economic instability  restrictions on transfer of funds  domestic and international customs and tariffs  unexpected changes in regulatory environments  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
labor in china has historically been readily available at relatively low cost as compared to labor costs in north america however  because china is experiencing rapid social  political and economic changes  labor costs have risen in some regions and there can be no assurance that labor will continue to be available to us in china at costs consistent with historical levels or that changes in labor or other laws will not be enacted which would have a material adverse effect on our operations in china 
any future increase in labor cost in china is likely to be higher than historical amounts 
as a result of experiencing such rapid social  political and economic change  china is also likely to enact new  and or revise its existing  labor laws and regulations on employee compensation and benefits 
any such changes in chinese labor laws and regulations would likely have an adverse effect on product manufacturing costs in china 
furthermore  if china laborers go on strike to demand higher wages  our operations could be disrupted 
although china currently enjoys most favored nation trading status with the united states  the us government has in the past proposed to revoke such status and to impose higher tariffs on products imported from china 
we cannot assure you that our business will not be affected by the aforementioned risks  each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we experience revenue declines and decreased profitability  we may incur future impairment charges that could have a material effect on our results of operations 
our revenue growth and profitability are dependent on our ability to introduce new products and maintain market share 
several factors also impact our profitability which are discussed in this section 
if declines in revenues and profitability prevent us from achieving our earnings projections  we may incur impairment charges related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets  or both 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the loss of our executive officers and the inability to attract and retain appropriately qualified replacements or the diversion of our chief executive officer s time and energy to permitted outside interests 
we are highly dependent on the continuing efforts of our executive officers  particularly martin e 
franklin  our chairman and chief executive officer  ian gh ashken  our vice chairman and chief financial officer  and james e 
lillie  our president and chief operating officer 
we believe these officers experience in the branded consumer products industry and our business  and with strategic acquisitions of complementary 
table of contents businesses within our primary business segments  has been important to our historical growth and is important to our future growth strategy 
we currently have employment agreements with all of these executive officers 
however  we cannot assure you that we will be able to retain any of these executive officers 
our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the loss of any of these executive officers and the inability to attract and retain appropriately qualified replacements 
in january  we announced our intention to promote mr 
lillie to chief executive officer and make mr 
franklin our executive chairman  effective as of our annual general meeting of stockholders 
there can be no assurance that these changes will be implemented successfully or that we will be able to transition to the new roles for these officers without disruption to our business 
we do not maintain key man insurance on any of our executive officers 
messrs 
franklin and ashken have other interests and engage in other activities beyond their positions at jarden something they are permitted to do under the terms of their respective employment agreements with us  provided such other activities do not interfere with their duties as executives of jarden or directly compete with us 
in particular  mr 
franklin has been and will be a director of investment companies whose strategy is to acquire one or more operating businesses 
because mr 
franklin may have an obligation to assist these other companies in actively sourcing and acquiring target businesses  he will be required to spend time and energy such time and energy may be potentially significant that he might otherwise devote to jarden on behalf of another enterprise  which could have an adverse impact on our business 
mr 
franklin has maintained outside business interests since becoming our chairman and chief executive officer in none of these outside business interests conflicts with his duties to jarden 
mr 
franklin has committed to our board of directors that any such outside company he assists in actively sourcing and acquiring target businesses will be seeking transactions outside of those that fit within jarden s publicly announced acquisition criteria and will not interfere with mr 
franklin s or mr 
ashken s obligations to jarden 
mr 
franklin also committed to the board of directors that in order to avoid the potential for a conflict  prior to any such outside company pursuing any acquisition transaction that jarden might consider  mr 
franklin would first confirm with an independent committee of our board of directors that jarden was not interested in pursuing the potential acquisition opportunity 
if the independent committee concludes that jarden is interested in that opportunity  the other company would not continue with that transaction 
however  we cannot assure you that the other company will not choose to pursue transactions that jarden would have considered 
if it pursues transactions that jarden would have considered  this could negatively impact jarden s growth from future acquisitions 
a deterioration of relations with our labor unions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
approximately union workers are covered by five collective bargaining agreements at five of our us facilities 
these agreements expire at our jar closure facility muncie  indiana in  at our match manufacturing facility cloquet  minnesota in  at our zinc facility greeneville  tennessee in  at our babycare facility reedsburg  wisconsin in and at our monofilament plant enka  north carolina in additionally  approximately employees at our legutiano  spain manufacturing facility  approximately employees at our lyon  france facility  approximately employees at our ipoh  malaysia facility  approximately employees at our zeven  germany facility  approximately employees at our other european facilities and approximately  employees at our latin america facilities are unionized 
we have not experienced a work stoppage during the past five years except for a brief work stoppage in in lyon  france in conjunction with a restructuring at that location 
however  we cannot assure you that there will not be a work stoppage in the future 
any such work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our business involves the potential for product recalls  product liability and other claims against us  which could affect our earnings and financial condition 
as a manufacturer and distributor of consumer products  we are subject to the consumer products safety act  which empowers the consumer products safety commission to exclude from the market products that are found to be unsafe or hazardous 
under certain circumstances  the consumer products safety commission could require us to repurchase or recall one or more of our products 
additionally  laws regulating certain consumer products exist in some cities and states  as well as in other countries in which we sell our products  and more restrictive laws and regulations may be adopted in the future 
any repurchase or recall of our products could be costly to us and could damage our reputation 
if we were required to remove  or we voluntarily removed  our products from the market  our reputation could be tarnished and we might have large quantities of finished products that we could not sell 
we also face exposure to product liability claims in the event that one of our products is alleged to have resulted in property damage  bodily injury or other adverse effects 
although we maintain product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are reasonable  we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms  if at all  in the future or that product liability claims will not exceed the amount of insurance coverage 
additionally  we do not maintain product recall insurance 
as a result  product recalls or product liability claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  we face potential exposure to unusual or significant litigation arising out of alleged defects in our products or otherwise 
we spend substantial resources ensuring compliance with governmental and other applicable standards 
however  compliance with these standards does not necessarily prevent individual or class action lawsuits  which can entail significant cost and risk 
we do not maintain insurance against many types of claims involving alleged defects in our products that do not involve personal injury or property damage 
as a result  these types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our product liability insurance program is an occurrence based program based on our current and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of insurance 
we currently either self insure or administer a high retention insurance program for product liability risks 
historically  product liability awards have rarely exceeded our individual per occurrence self insured retention 
we cannot assure you  however  that our future product liability experience will be consistent with our past experience 
see note commitments and contingencies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  for a further discussion of these and other regulatory and litigation related matters 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours  which could adversely affect our market share and results of operations 
our success with our proprietary products depends  in part  on our ability to protect our current and future technologies and products and to defend our intellectual property rights 
if we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may manufacture and market products similar to ours 
our principal intellectual property rights include our trademarks 
we also hold numerous design and utility patents covering a wide variety of products 
we cannot be sure that we will receive patents for any of our patent applications or that any existing or future patents that we receive or license will provide competitive advantages for our products 
we also cannot be sure that competitors will not challenge  invalidate or avoid the application of any existing or future patents that we receive or license 

table of contents in addition  patent rights may not prevent our competitors from developing  using or selling products that are similar or functionally equivalent to our products 
our results could be adversely affected if the cost of compliance with environmental  health and safety laws and regulations becomes too burdensome 
our operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those that impose workplace standards and regulate the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the handling  generation  emission  release  discharge  treatment  storage and disposal of materials and substances including solid and hazardous wastes 
we believe that we are in material compliance with such laws and regulations and that the cost of maintaining compliance will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
however  due to the nature of our operations and the frequently changing nature of environmental compliance standards and technology  we cannot assure you that future material capital expenditures will not be required in order to comply with applicable environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
we may be subject to environmental and other regulations due to our production and marketing of products in certain states and countries 
we also face increasing complexity in our product design and procurement operations as we adjust to new requirements relating to the materials composition of our products 
the european union eu issued two directives  currently in effect  relating to chemical substances in electronic products 
the waste electrical and electronic equipment directive requires producers of electrical goods to pay for specified collection  recycling  treatment and disposal of past and future covered products the weee legislation 
the eu has issued another directive that requires electrical and electronic equipment placed on the eu market after july  to be free of lead  mercury  cadmium  hexavalent chromium above a threshold limit and brominated flame retardants the rohs legislation 
if we do not comply with these directives  we may suffer a loss of revenue  be unable to sell in certain markets and or countries  be subject to penalties and enforced fees and or suffer a competitive disadvantage 
similar legislation could be enacted in other jurisdictions  including in the united states 
costs to comply with the weee legislation  rohs legislation and or similar future legislation  if applicable  could include costs associated with modifying our products  recycling and other waste processing costs  legal and regulatory costs and insurance costs 
we may also be required to take reserves for costs associated with compliance with these regulations 
we cannot assure you that the costs to comply with these new laws  or with current and future environmental and worker health and safety laws  will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may incur significant costs in order to comply with environmental remediation obligations 
in addition to operational standards  environmental laws also impose obligations on various entities to clean up contaminated properties or to pay for the cost of such remediation  often upon parties that did not actually cause the contamination 
accordingly  we may be liable  either contractually or by operation of law  for remediation costs even if the contaminated property is not presently owned or operated by us  is a landfill or other location where we have disposed wastes  or if the contamination was caused by third parties during or prior to our ownership or operation of the property 
given the nature of the past industrial operations conducted by us and others at these properties  there can be no assurance that all potential instances of soil or groundwater contamination have been identified  even for those properties where an environmental site assessment has been conducted 
we do not believe that any of our existing remediation obligations  including at third party sites where we have been named a potentially responsible party  will have a material adverse effect upon our business  results of operations or financial condition 
however  future events  such as changes in existing laws or policies or their enforcement  or the discovery of currently unknown contamination  may give rise to additional remediation liabilities that may be material

table of contents compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses 
changing laws  regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure  including the sarbanes oxley act of  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  new commission regulations and new york stock exchange market rules  are creating uncertainty for companies such as ours 
these new or changed laws  regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations  in many cases due to their lack of specificity 
as a result  their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies  which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices 
we are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure 
as a result  our efforts to comply with evolving laws  regulations and standards have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our required assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting and our external auditors audit of that assessment have required the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
we expect these efforts to require the continued commitment of significant resources 
furthermore  our board members  chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which could harm our business 
if our efforts to comply with new or changed laws  regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice  our reputation may be harmed 
we may not be able to implement or operate successfully and without interruptions to the operating software systems and other computer technologies that we depend on to operate our business  which could negatively impact or disrupt our business 
we are in the process of selecting or implementing new operating software systems within a number of our business segments and complications from these projects could cause considerable disruptions to our business 
while significant testing will take place and the rollout will occur in stages  the period of change from the old system to the new system will involve risk 
application program bugs  system conflict crashes  user error  data integrity issues  customer data conflicts and integration issues among our legacy systems all pose potential risks 
implementing data standards such as rfid  which our largest customers are requiring that we use  involves significant effort across the entire organization 
any problems with or delays of this implementation could impact our ability to do business and could result in higher implementation costs and reallocation of human resources 
we rely on other companies to maintain some of our information technology infrastructure 
should they fail to perform due to events outside our control  it could affect our service levels and threaten our ability to conduct business 
in addition  natural disasters such as hurricanes may disrupt our infrastructure and our disaster recovery process may not be sufficient to protect against loss 
additionally  our business operations are dependent on our logistical systems  which include our order management systems and our computerized warehouse systems 
any interruption in our logistical systems could impact our ability to procure our products from our factories and suppliers  transport them to our distribution facilities  store them and deliver them to our customers on time and in the correct amounts

in addition  the company or certain of its subsidiaries have been identified by the united states environmental protection agency epa or a state environmental agency as a potentially responsible party prp pursuant to the federal superfund act and or state superfund laws comparable to the federal law at various sites 
based on currently available information  the company does not believe that the disposition of any of the legal or environmental disputes the company or its subsidiaries are currently involved in will have a material adverse effect upon the company s consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
it is possible that  as additional information becomes available  the impact on the company of an adverse determination could have a different effect 
litigation the company and or its subsidiaries are involved in various lawsuits arising from time to time that the company considers ordinary routine litigation incidental to its business 
amounts accrued for litigation matters represent the anticipated costs damages and or settlement amounts in connection with pending litigation and claims and related anticipated legal fees for defending such actions 
the costs are accrued when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
the accruals are based upon the company s assessment  after consultation with counsel if deemed appropriate  of probable loss based on the facts and circumstances of each case  the legal issues involved  the nature of the claim made  the nature of the damages sought and any relevant information about the plaintiffs and other significant factors that vary by case 
when it is not possible to estimate a specific expected cost to be incurred  the company evaluates the range of probable loss and records the minimum end of the range 
the company believes that anticipated probable costs of litigation matters have been adequately reserved to the extent determinable 
based on current information  the company believes that the ultimate conclusion of the various pending litigation of the company  in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
product liability as a consumer goods manufacturer and distributor  the company and or its subsidiaries face the risk of product liability and related lawsuits involving claims for substantial money damages  product recall actions and higher than anticipated rates of warranty returns or other returns of goods 

table of contents the company and or its subsidiaries are therefore party to various personal injury and property damage lawsuits relating to their products and incidental to its business 
annually  the company sets its product liability insurance program which is an occurrence based program based on the company and its subsidiaries current and historical claims experience and the availability and cost of insurance 
the company s product liability insurance program generally includes a self insurance retention per occurrence 
cumulative amounts estimated to be payable by the company with respect to pending and potential claims for all years in which the company is liable under its self insurance retention have been accrued as liabilities 
such accrued liabilities are based on estimates which include actuarial determinations made by an independent actuarial consultant as to liability exposure  taking into account prior experience  number of claims and other relevant factors  thus  the company s ultimate liability may exceed or be less than the amounts accrued 
the methods of making such estimates and establishing the resulting liability are reviewed on a regular basis and any adjustments resulting therefrom are reflected in current operating results 
based on current information  the company believes that the ultimate conclusion of the various pending product liability claims and lawsuits of the company  in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company
