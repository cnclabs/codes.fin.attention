item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update or revise publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
references in this annual report on form k to we  our  us and the company refer to diamondrock hospitality company  including as the context requires  diamondrock hospitality limited partnership  as well as our other direct and indirect subsidiaries 
part i item business overview we are a lodging focused real estate company that  as of february   owns a portfolio of premium hotels and resorts that contain  guestrooms and a senior mortgage loan secured by another hotel 
we are an owner  as opposed to an operator  of the hotels in our portfolio 
as an owner  we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels after we pay fees to the hotel managers  which are based on the revenues and profitability of the hotels 
our vision is to be the premier allocator of capital in the lodging industry 
our mission is to deliver long term stockholder returns through a combination of dividends and long term capital appreciation 
our strategy is to utilize disciplined capital allocation and focus on acquiring  owning  and measured dispositions of high quality  branded lodging properties in north america with superior long term growth prospects in markets with high barriers to entry for new supply 
in addition  we are committed to enhancing the value of our platform by being open and transparent in our communications with investors  monitoring our corporate overhead and following sound corporate governance practices 
consistent with our strategy  we continue to focus on opportunistically investing in premium full service hotels and  to a lesser extent  premium urban limited service hotels located throughout north america 
our portfolio of hotels is concentrated in key gateway cities and in destination resort locations 
all of our hotels are operated under a brand owned by one of the leading global lodging brand companies marriott international  inc marriott  starwood hotels resorts worldwide  inc starwood or hilton worldwide hilton 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors because of our adherence to three basic principles high quality urban and destination resort focused branded hotel real estate  conservative capital structure  and thoughtful asset management 
high quality urban and destination resort focused branded real estate we own premium hotels and resorts in north america 
these hotels and resorts are primarily categorized as upper upscale as defined by smith travel research and are generally located in high barrier to entry markets with multiple demand generators 
our properties are concentrated in five key gateway cities new york city  los angeles  chicago  boston and atlanta and in destination resort locations such as the us virgin islands and vail  colorado 
we believe that gateway cities and destination resorts 
table of contents will achieve higher long term growth because they are attractive business and leisure destinations 
we also believe that these locations are better insulated from new supply due to relatively high barriers to entry  including expensive construction costs and limited prime hotel development sites 
we believe that higher quality lodging assets create more dynamic cash flow growth and superior long term capital appreciation 
in addition  a core tenet of our strategy is to leverage global hotel brands 
we strongly believe in the value of powerful global brands because we believe that they are able to produce incremental revenue and profits compared to similar unbranded hotels 
dominant global hotel brands typically have very strong reservation and reward systems and sales organizations  and all of our hotels are operated under a brand owned by one of the top global lodging brand companies marriott  starwood or hilton and all but three of our hotels are managed by the brand company directly 
generally  we are interested in owning hotels that are currently operated under  or can be converted to  a globally recognized brand 
however  we would consider owning non branded hotels in certain top tier or unique markets if we believe that the returns on these hotels would be higher than if the hotels were operated under a globally recognized brand 
conservative capital structure since our formation in  we have been committed to a conservative capital structure with prudent leverage 
all of our outstanding debt is fixed interest rate mortgage debt with no maturities until late we also maintain low financial leverage by funding a portion of our acquisitions with proceeds from the issuance of equity 
we have a preference to maintain a significant portion of our portfolio as unencumbered assets in order to provide maximum balance sheet flexibility 
in addition  to the extent that we incur additional debt  our preference is limited recourse secured mortgage debt 
we expect that our strategy will enable us to maintain a balance sheet with a moderate amount of debt throughout all phases of the lodging cycle 
we believe that it is not prudent to increase the inherent risk of a highly cyclical business through a highly levered capital structure 
we prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure 
we have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any operating partnership units or preferred stock 
we endeavor to structure our hotel acquisitions so that they will not overly complicate our capital structure  however  we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available 
as of december   we had million of unrestricted corporate cash 
we believe that we maintain a reasonable amount of fixed interest rate mortgage debt 
as of december   we had million of mortgage debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of percent and a weighted average maturity date of approximately years  with no maturities until late in addition  we amended and restated our million unsecured credit facility in august we currently have hotels unencumbered by debt and no corporate level debt outstanding 
thoughtful asset management we believe that we are able to create significant value in our portfolio by utilizing our management team s extensive experience and our innovative asset management strategies 
our senior management team has an established broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships  including relationships with hotel owners  financiers  operators  project managers and contractors and other key industry participants 
as the economic recovery continues  we will explore strategic options to maximize the growth of our revenue and profitability 
we continue to focus our hotel managers on minimizing the increases in our property level operating expenses and we continue to maintain modest corporate expenses 
we are also continuing to work closely with our hotel managers to optimize the mix of business at our hotels in order to maximize potential revenue 
we use our broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships to maximize the value of our hotels 
under the federal income tax rules governing reits  we are required to engage a hotel manager that is an eligible independent contractor through one of our subsidiaries to manage each of our hotels pursuant to a management agreement 
our philosophy is to negotiate management agreements that give us the right to exert significant influence over the management of our properties  annual budgets and all capital expenditures all  to the extent permitted under the reit rules  and then to use those rights to continually monitor and improve the performance of our properties 
we cooperatively partner with our hotel managers in an attempt to increase operating results and long term asset values at our hotels 
in addition to working directly with the personnel at our hotels  our senior management team also has long standing professional relationships with our hotel managers senior executives  and we work directly with these senior executives to improve the performance of our portfolio 

table of contents we believe we can create significant value in our portfolio through innovative asset management strategies such as rebranding  renovating and repositioning 
we are committed to regularly evaluating our portfolio to determine if we can employ these value added strategies at our hotels 
our company we commenced operations in july since our formation  we have sought to be open and transparent in our communications with investors  to monitor our corporate overhead and to follow sound corporate governance practices 
we believe that we have among the most transparent disclosure in the industry  consistently going beyond the minimum legal requirements and industry practice  for example  we provide quarterly operating performance data on each of our hotels enabling our investors to evaluate our successes and our failures 
in addition  we have been able to acquire and finance our hotels  asset manage them  complete approximately million of capital expenditures on time and on budget  and comply with the complex accounting and legal requirements of a public company with only employees 
finally  we believe that we have implemented sound corporate governance practices in that we have a majority independent board of directors that is elected annually by our stockholders  we believe that we are subject to limited corporate or statutory anti takeover devices and our directors and officers are subject to stock ownership policies that are designed so that our directors and officers will own a meaningful amount of our stock 
as of december   we owned hotels that contained  hotel rooms  located in the following markets atlanta  georgia  austin  texas  boston  massachusetts  charleston  south carolina  chicago  illinois  fort worth  texas  lexington  kentucky  los angeles  california  minneapolis  minnesota  new york  new york  oak brook  illinois  orlando  florida  salt lake city  utah  washington dc  sonoma  california  st 
thomas  dc virgin islands  and vail  colorado 
we also own a senior mortgage loan secured by a room hotel located in chicago  illinois 
our relationship with marriott investment sourcing relationship we have an investment sourcing relationship with marriott  a leading worldwide hotel brand  franchise and management company 
pursuant to this relationship  marriott has provided us with an early opportunity to bid on hotel acquisition and investment opportunities known to marriott 
historically  this relationship has generated a number of additional acquisition opportunities  with many of the opportunities being off market transactions  meaning that they are not made generally available to other real estate investment companies 
however  we have not entered into a binding agreement or commitment setting forth the terms of this investment sourcing relationship 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our investment sourcing relationship with marriott will continue or not be modified 
our senior management team periodically meets with senior representatives of marriott to explore how to further our investment sourcing relationship in order to maximize the value of the relationship to both parties 
during  we acquired the renaissance charleston through our investment sourcing relationship with marriott 
we actively monitor the acquisition market and believe our investment sourcing relationship with marriott will continue to prove to be valuable in identifying and executing acquisitions 
key money and yield support marriott has contributed to us certain amounts in exchange for the right to manage hotels we have acquired and in connection with the completion of certain brand enhancing capital projects 
we refer to these amounts as key money 
previously  marriott provided us with key money of approximately million in the aggregate in connection with our acquisitions of six of our hotels and the renovations of certain hotels 
in addition  marriott provided us with operating cash flow guarantees for certain hotels and funded shortfalls of actual hotel operating income compared to a negotiated target net operating income 
we refer to these guarantees as yield support 
marriott provided us with yield support for the oak brook hills marriott resort and orlando airport marriott  all of which we earned during fiscal years and we are not entitled to any further yield support at any of our hotels 
investment in diamondrock in connection with our july private placement and our initial public offering  marriott purchased an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at the same purchase price as all other investors 
marriott has since sold all of its shares in diamondrock 

table of contents our corporate structure we conduct our business through a traditional umbrella partnership reit  or upreit  in which our hotels are owned by subsidiaries of our operating partnership  diamondrock hospitality limited partnership 
we are the sole general partner of our operating partnership and currently own  either directly or indirectly  all of the limited partnership units of our operating partnership 
we have the ability to issue limited partnership units to third parties in connection with acquisitions of hotel properties 
in order for the income from our hotel investments to constitute rents from real properties for purposes of the gross income tests required for reit qualification  we must lease each of our hotels to our taxable reit subsidiary  or trs  to a wholly owned subsidiary of our trs each  a trs lessee  or to an unrelated third party 
we currently lease all of our domestic hotels to trs lessees 
in turn our trs lessees must engage a third party management company to manage the hotels 
however  we may structure our properties that are not subject to us federal income tax differently from the structures we use for our us properties 
for example  frenchman s reef is held by a united states virgin islands corporation  which we have elected to be a trs 
the following chart shows our corporate structure as of the date of this report flowchart logo environmental matters under various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  a current or previous owner  operator or tenant of real estate may be required to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases or threats of releases at such property and may be held liable to a government entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation  clean up and monitoring costs incurred by such parties in connection with the actual or threatened contamination 
these laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to fault  or whether or not the owner  operator or tenant knew of or caused the presence of the contamination 
the liability under these laws may be joint and several for the full amount of the investigation  clean up and monitoring costs incurred or to be incurred or actions to be undertaken  although a party held jointly and severally liable may obtain contributions from other identified  solvent  responsible parties of their fair share toward these costs 
these costs may be substantial and can exceed the value of the property 
the presence of contamination  or the failure to properly remediate contamination  on a property may adversely affect the ability of the owner  operator or tenant to sell or rent that property or to borrow funds using such property as collateral and may adversely impact our investment in that property 
federal regulations require building owners and those exercising control over a building s management to identify and warn  via signs and labels  of potential hazards posed by workplace exposure to installed asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials in their building 
the regulations also set forth employee training  record keeping and due diligence requirements pertaining to asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials 
significant fines can be assessed for violation 
table of contents of these regulations 
building owners and those exercising control over a building s management may be subject to an increased risk of personal injury lawsuits by workers and others exposed to asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials as a result of these regulations 
the regulations may affect the value of a building containing asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials in which we have invested 
federal  state and local laws and regulations also govern the removal  encapsulation  disturbance  handling and disposal of asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of construction  remodeling  renovation or demolition of a building 
such laws may impose liability for improper handling or a release to the environment of asbestos containing materials and potentially asbestos containing materials and may provide for fines to  and for third parties to seek recovery from  owners or operators of real estate facilities for personal injury or improper work exposure associated with asbestos containing materials and potential asbestos containing materials 
prior to closing any property acquisition  we obtain phase i environmental assessments in order to attempt to identify potential environmental concerns at the properties 
these assessments are carried out in accordance with an appropriate level of due diligence and will generally include a physical site inspection  a review of relevant federal  state and local environmental and health agency database records  one or more interviews with appropriate site related personnel  review of the property s chain of title and review of historic aerial photographs and other information on past uses of the property 
these assessments generally do not include soil sampling  subservice investigations  comprehensive asbestos surveys or mold investigations 
we may also conduct limited subsurface investigations and test for substances of concern where the results of the phase i environmental assessments or other information indicates possible contamination or where our consultants recommend such procedures 
we cannot assure you that these assessments will discover every environmental condition that may be present on a property 
we believe that our hotels are in compliance  in all material respects  with all federal  state and local environmental ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and other environmental matters  the violation of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
we have not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our present properties 
competition the hotel industry is highly competitive and our hotels are subject to competition from other hotels for guests 
competition is based on a number of factors  including convenience of location  brand affiliation  price  range of services  guest amenities  and quality of customer service 
competition is specific to the individual markets in which our properties are located and will include competition from existing and new hotels operated under brands in the full service  select service and extended stay segments 
we believe that properties flagged with a marriott  starwood or hilton brand will enjoy the competitive advantages associated with their operations under such brand 
these global brands reservation systems and national advertising  marketing and promotional services combined with the strong management expertise they provide enable our properties to perform favorably in terms of both occupancy and room rates relative to other brands and non branded hotels 
the guest loyalty programs operated by these global brands generate repeat guest business that might otherwise go to competing hotels 
increased competition may have a material adverse effect on occupancy  adr and revpar or may require us to make capital improvements that we otherwise would not undertake  which may result in decreases in the profitability of our hotels 
we face competition for the acquisition of hotels from institutional pension funds  private equity funds  reits  hotel companies and others who are engaged in hotel acquisitions and investments 
some of these competitors have substantially greater financial and operational resources than we have and may have greater knowledge of the markets in which we seek to invest 
this competition may reduce the number of suitable investment opportunities offered to us and increase the cost of acquiring our targeted hotel investments 
employees we currently employ full time employees 
we believe that our relations with our employees are good 
none of our employees is a member of any union  however  the employees of our hotel managers at the courtyard manhattan fifth avenue  frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort  westin boston waterfront hotel and hilton minneapolis are currently represented by labor unions and are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
legal proceedings except as described below  we are not involved in any material litigation nor  to our knowledge  is any material litigation pending or threatened against us 
we are involved in routine litigation arising out of the ordinary course of business  all of which is expected to be covered by insurance and is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we are involved in foreclosure proceedings against the borrower under the senior mortgage loan we acquired in may  which is secured by the allerton hotel  located in chicago  illinois 
the proceedings were initiated in april and  if successful  would result in the company owning the allerton hotel 
the timing and completion of foreclosure proceedings in cook county  illinois is uncertain and depends on a variety of factors 
no precise timeframe for completion of the foreclosure proceedings on the loan can be given and no assurances can be given that the proceedings will be successful 
a junior lender which held debt subordinated to the allerton loan intervened in the foreclosure proceedings and recently filed a counterclaim against the company in the proceedings 
this junior lender alleges in its counterclaim that certain press releases and public statements made by the company in connection with its acquisition of the allerton loan were intended to and did impair or destroy the value of the junior lender s interest in its subordinated debt  which it was attempting to sell 
the matter is in the early stages of litigation  and while the company intends to vigorously defend this claim  no assurances can be given that we will be successful 
we cannot presently determine the likelihood of the outcome or amount of potential loss  if any  however  we do not expect any potential loss to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  certain employees at the los angeles marriott airport hotel  which is owned by one of the company s subsidiaries  and certain employees at other hotels in the vicinity of the los angeles airport  have brought a claim against the company and marriott and other lax area hotel owners and operators alleging that these hotels did not comply with an ordinance adopted by the los angeles city council governing payment of service charges to certain employees at these hotels 
the litigation is in the discovery phase 
we cannot presently determine the likelihood of the outcome or amount of potential loss  if any  however  we do not expect any potential loss to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
regulation our properties must comply with title iii of the americans with disabilities act  or ada  to the extent that such properties are public accommodations as defined by the ada 
the ada may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable 
we believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ada and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ada 
however  noncompliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one  and we will continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect 
insurance we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage  earthquake  business interruption and rental loss insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio under a blanket policy 
in addition  we carry earthquake and terrorism insurance on our properties in an amount and with deductibles  which we believe are commercially reasonable 
we do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses such as loss from riots  war or acts of god 
certain of the properties in our portfolio are located in areas known to be seismically active or subject to hurricanes and we believe we have appropriate insurance for those risks  although they are subject to higher deductibles than ordinary property insurance 
most of our hotel management agreements provide that we are responsible for obtaining and maintaining property insurance  business interruption insurance  flood insurance  earthquake insurance if the hotel is located in an earthquake prone zone as determined by the us geological survey and other customary types of insurance related to hotels and the hotel manager is responsible for obtaining general liability insurance  workers compensation and employer s liability insurance

table of contents item a 
risk factors the following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on form k should be carefully considered 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks occur  our business  financial condition  operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected 
risks related to our business and operations our business model  especially our concentration in premium full service hotels  can be highly volatile 
we own hotels  a very different asset class from many other reits 
a typical office reit  for example  has long term leases with third party tenants  which provide a relatively stable long term stream of revenue 
our trs  on the other hand  does not enter into a lease with a hotel manager 
instead  our trs engages the hotel manager pursuant to a management agreement and pays the manager a fee for managing the hotel 
the trs receives all the operating profit or losses at the hotel 
moreover  virtually all hotel guests stay at the hotel for only a few nights  so the rate and occupancy at each of our hotels changes every day 
as a result  we may have highly volatile earnings 
in addition to fluctuations related to our business model  our hotels are and will continue to be subject to various long term operating risks common to the hotel industry  many of which are beyond our control  including dependence on business and commercial travelers and tourism  both of which vary with consumer and business confidence in the strength of the general economy  competition from other hotels that may be located in our markets  an over supply or over building of hotels in our markets  which could adversely affect occupancy rates and revenues at our properties  increases in energy and transportation costs and other expenses affecting travel  which may affect travel patterns and reduce the number of business and commercial travelers and tourists  increases in operating costs due to inflation and other factors that may not be offset by increased room rates  and changes in governmental laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance 
in addition  our hotels are mostly in the premium full service segment of the hotel business that  historically  tends to have the best operating results in a strong economy and the worst results in a weak economy as many travelers choose lower cost and more limited service hotels 
in periods of weak demand  such as the recent economic recession  profitability is negatively affected by the relatively high fixed costs of operating premium full service hotels when compared to other classes of hotels 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
our portfolio is highly concentrated in a handful of core markets 
during  over of our earnings were derived from our hotels in five gateway cities new york city  boston  chicago  los angeles and atlanta and three destination resorts frenchman s reef  vail marriott  and the lodge at sonoma and as such  the operations of these hotels will have a material impact on our overall results of operations 
this concentration in our portfolio may lead to increased volatility in our results 
if lodging fundamentals in any of these cities are poor compared to the united states as a whole  the popularity of any of these destinations resorts decreases  or a manmade or natural disaster or casualty or other damage occurs to one of our key hotels  our overall results of operations may be adversely affected 
recent economic conditions may continue to adversely affect the lodging industry 
the performance of the lodging industry has historically been linked to key macroeconomic indicators  such as gdp growth  employment  corporate earnings and investment  and travel demand 
as these indicators improve  we anticipate that lodging operating 
table of contents fundamentals will improve as well 
however  if the early stage economic recovery should falter and there is a further extended period of economic weakness  our revenues and profitability could be adversely affected 
our hotels are subject to significant competition 
currently  the markets where our hotels are located are very competitive 
however  a material increase in the supply of new hotel rooms to a market can quickly destabilize that market and existing hotels can experience rapidly decreasing revpar and profitability 
if such over building occurs in one or more of our major markets  we may experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in particular  we own the marriott chicago downtown and the renaissance austin  each of which is being impacted by new supply in its respective market 
in chicago  a new jw marriott opened in november and is likely to impact the performance of the marriott chicago downtown by directly competing for marriott customers  particularly business transient travelers  a typically high adr segment 
in austin  the westin austin at the domain opened in march and is a strong competitor to our renaissance austin as it is located near several corporate customers of our hotel 
additionally  over  rooms have been  or will be  added to the manhattan hotel market 
although the new supply is not expected to be directly competitive to our two courtyard hotels in manhattan  because many of these hotels are not located near our courtyard hotels nor do they have the benefit of a well recognized national hotel brand  there nevertheless may be an impact on the performance of our courtyard hotels if demand for rooms in manhattan declines 
however  we do believe the new supply is directly competitive to the hilton garden inn chelsea new york city and is likely to impact the operating performance of that hotel 
investments in hotels are illiquid and we may not be able to respond in a timely fashion to adverse changes in the performance of our properties 
because real estate investments are relatively illiquid  our ability to promptly sell one or more hotel properties or investments in our portfolio in response to changing economic  financial and investment conditions may be limited 
the real estate market is affected by many factors that are beyond our control  including adverse changes in international  national  regional and local economic and market conditions  changes in supply of competitive hotels  changes in interest rates and in the availability  cost and terms of debt financing  changes in governmental laws and regulations  fiscal policies and zoning ordinances and the related costs of compliance with laws and regulations  fiscal policies and ordinances  the ongoing need for capital improvements  particularly in older structures  changes in operating expenses  and civil unrest  acts of god  including earthquakes  floods  hurricanes and other natural disasters and acts of war or terrorism  including the consequences of terrorist acts such as those that occurred on september   which may result in uninsured losses 
it may be in the best interest of our stockholders to sell one or more of our hotels in the future 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sell any hotel property or investment at an acceptable price or otherwise on reasonable terms and conditions 
we also cannot predict the length of time needed to find a willing purchaser and to close the sale of a hotel property or loan 
these facts and any others that would impede our ability to respond to adverse changes in the performance of our hotel properties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition  as well as our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in the event of natural disasters  terrorist attacks  significant military actions  outbreaks of contagious diseases or other events for which we may not have adequate insurance  our operations may suffer 
one of our major hotels  frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort  is located on the side of a cliff facing the ocean in the us virgin islands  which is in the so called hurricane belt in the caribbean 
the hotel was partially destroyed by a hurricane 
table of contents in the mid s and since then has been damaged by subsequent hurricanes  including hurricane earl in august in addition  three of our hotels  the los angeles airport marriott  the torrance marriott south bay and the lodge at sonoma  a renaissance resort spa  are located in areas that are seismically active 
finally  ten of our hotels are located in metropolitan markets that have been  or may in the future be  targets of actual or threatened terrorist attacks  including new york city  chicago  boston and los angeles 
these hotels are each material to our financial results 
the chicago marriott  westin boston waterfront hotel  los angeles airport marriott  frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort  courtyard manhattan midtown east  conrad chicago  torrance marriott south bay  the lodge at sonoma  courtyard manhattan fifth avenue and hilton garden inn chelsea new york city constituted approximately         and  respectively  of our total revenues in additionally  even in the absence of direct physical damage to our hotels  the occurrence of any natural disasters  terrorist attacks  significant military actions  outbreaks of contagious diseases  such as hn  sars or the avian bird flu  or other casualty events affecting the united states  will likely have a material adverse effect on business and commercial travelers and tourists  the economy generally and the hotel and tourism industries in particular 
while we cannot predict the impact of the occurrence of any of these events  such impact could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
we have acquired and intend to maintain comprehensive insurance on each of our hotels  including liability  terrorism  fire and extended coverage  of the type and amount we believe are customarily obtained for or by hotel owners 
we cannot assure you that such coverage will be available at reasonable rates or with reasonable deductibles 
for example  frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort has a high deductible if it is damaged due to a wind storm 
various types of catastrophic losses  like earthquakes  floods  losses from foreign terrorist activities  or losses from domestic terrorist activities may not be insurable or are generally not insured because of economic infeasibility  legal restrictions or the policies of insurers 
future lenders may require such insurance and our failure to obtain such insurance could constitute a default under loan agreements 
depending on our access to capital  liquidity and the value of the properties securing the affected loan in relation to the balance of the loan  a default could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and ability to obtain future financing 
in the event of a substantial loss  our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full current market value or replacement cost of our lost investment 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in a hotel  as well as the anticipated future revenue from that particular hotel 
in that event  we might nevertheless remain obligated for any mortgage debt or other financial obligations related to the property 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a hotel after it has been damaged or destroyed 
under those circumstances  the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position with regard to the damaged or destroyed property 
with or without insurance  damage to any of our hotels  or to the hotel industry generally  due to fire  hurricane  earthquake  terrorism  outbreaks such as hn  sars  or the avian bird flu or other man made or natural disasters or casualty events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
we are subject to risks associated with our ongoing need for renovations and capital improvements as well as financing for such expenditures 
in order to remain competitive  our hotels have an ongoing need for renovations and other capital improvements  including replacements  from time to time  of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
these capital improvements may give rise to the following risks construction cost overruns and delays  a possible shortage of available cash to fund capital improvements and the related possibility that financing for these capital improvements may not be available to us on affordable terms  the renovation investment not resulting in the returns on investment that we expect  disruptions in the operations of the hotel as well as in demand for the hotel while capital improvements are underway  and disputes with franchisors hotel managers regarding compliance with relevant management franchise agreements 
the costs of these capital improvements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 

table of contents in addition  we may not be able to fund capital improvements or acquisitions solely from cash provided from our operating activities because we generally must distribute at least of our reit taxable income  determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains  each year to maintain our reit tax status 
as a result  our ability to fund capital expenditures  or investments through retained earnings  is very limited 
consequently  we rely upon the availability of debt or equity capital to fund our investments and capital improvements  but due to the current recession and capital markets crisis  these sources of funds may not be available on reasonable terms and conditions 
there are several specific risks associated with the ownership of frenchman s reef 
frenchman s reef is located on the side of a cliff facing the ocean in the united states virgin islands  which is in the so called hurricane belt in the caribbean 
it was partially destroyed by a hurricane in the mid s and since then has been damaged by subsequent hurricanes  including hurricane earl in august while we maintain insurance against wind damage in an amount we believe is customarily obtained for or by hotel owners  frenchman s reef has a deductible of approximately million if it is damaged due to a named windstorm event  therefore  we are self insured for losses up to million caused by a named windstorm event 
while we cannot predict whether there will be another hurricane that will impact this hotel  if there were  then it could have a material adverse affect on the operations of this hotel 
further  in the event of a substantial loss  our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover the full current market value or replacement cost of our investment 
should a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in frenchman s reef  as well as the anticipated future revenue of this hotel 
in that event  we might nevertheless remain obligated for mortgage debt related to frenchman s reef 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations and other factors might also keep us from using insurance proceeds to replace or renovate a hotel after it has been damaged or destroyed 
under those circumstances  the insurance proceeds we receive might be inadequate to restore our economic position with regard to the damaged or destroyed property 
we are currently undertaking a renovation and repositioning program at frenchman s reef  including a major redesign of the pool  spa upgrade and expansion  infrastructure improvements  including the hvac system  and renovation of guestrooms 
this renovation and repositioning gives rise to several risks  including construction cost overruns and delays  the renovation investment not resulting in the returns on investment that we expect  closure of part of the hotel for longer than expected  and reduction in demand for the portion of the hotel that remains open while capital improvements are underway 
these costs and delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
the cost of utilities at frenchman s reef is highly correlated to oil prices 
if the price of oil were to increase back to the levels experienced prior to  the cost of utilities would likely increase dramatically and this would have a significant impact on the results of operation 
also  the hotel has experienced disruptions in service from the local utility providers  including power outages from time to time 
the hotel has generators in place that are able to provide power when these outages occur 
part of the renovation and repositioning program includes a redesign to the mechanical plant to allow the hotel to generate its own electricity  which is expected to significantly reduce both the kilowatt hour consumption and the cost per kilowatt hour as well as enhance guest comfort 
however  there can be no assurance that we will complete this project or that the significant consumption and cost savings can be achieved 
frenchman s reef benefits from a tax holiday  which was recently extended to february the provisions of the tax holiday permit us to pay income taxes at percent of the statutory tax rate of percent in the us virgin islands 
there can be no assurance that such tax exemptions or similar exemptions will be secured at the expiration of the current tax holiday 
our hotel portfolio is not diverse by brand or manager and there are risks associated with using marriott s brands on most of our hotels and having marriott manage most of our hotels 
our success depends in part on the success of marriott 
eighteen of our current hotels utilize brands owned by marriott 
as a result  our success is dependent in part on the continued success of marriott and its brands 
we believe that building brand value is critical to increasing demand and building customer loyalty 
if market recognition or the positive perception of these marriott brands is reduced or compromised  the goodwill associated with marriott branded hotels may be adversely affected and the results of operations of our hotels may be adversely affected 
as a result  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
our success depends in part on maintaining good relations with marriott 

table of contents we have pursued  and continue to pursue  hotel investment opportunities referred to us by marriott  and we intend to work with marriott as our preferred hotel management company 
marriott is paid a fee based on gross revenues and profitability of the hotels they manage while we only benefit from operating profits at our hotels 
thus  it is possible that marriott may desire to undertake operating strategies  or encourage us to add amenities or undertake renovations  which are designed to generate significant gross revenues  but an unreasonably small return on investment 
due to the differences in how each company earns its money  which company is responsible for operating losses and capital expenditures  and tensions between an individual hotel and the brand standards of a large chain  there are natural conflicts between an owner of a hotel and a brand company  such as marriott 
these differing objectives could result in deterioration in our relationship with marriott and may adversely affect our ability to execute business strategies  which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
over the last several years  marriott has been involved in contractual and other disputes with owners of the hotels it manages 
although we currently maintain good relations with marriott  we cannot assure you that disputes between us and marriott regarding the management of our properties will not arise 
should our relationship with marriott deteriorate  we believe that two of our competitive advantages namely our ability to work with senior executives at marriott to improve the asset management of our hotels and our investment sourcing relationship could be eliminated  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
our results of operations are highly dependent on the management of our hotel properties by third party hotel management companies  including marriott 
in order to qualify as a reit  we cannot operate our hotel properties or control the daily operations of our hotel properties 
our trs lessees may not operate these hotel properties and  therefore  they must enter into third party hotel management agreements with one or more eligible independent contractors including marriott 
thus  third party hotel management companies that enter into management contracts with our trs lessees will control the daily operations of our hotel properties 
under the terms of the hotel management agreements that we have entered into  or that we will enter into in the future  our ability to participate in operating decisions regarding our hotel properties is limited 
we currently rely  and will continue to rely  on these hotel management companies to adequately operate our hotel properties under the terms of the hotel management agreements 
we do not have the authority to require any hotel property to be operated in a particular manner or to govern any particular aspect of its operations for instance  setting room rates 
thus  even if we believe our hotel properties are being operated inefficiently or in a manner that does not result in satisfactory occupancy rates  adrs and operating profits  we may not have sufficient rights under our hotel management agreements to enable us to force the hotel management company to change its method of operation 
we can only seek redress if a hotel management company violates the terms of the applicable hotel management agreement with the trs lessee  and then only to the extent of the remedies provided for under the terms of the hotel management agreement 
our current management agreements are generally non terminable  subject to certain exceptions for cause  and in the event that we need to replace any of our hotel management companies pursuant to termination for cause  we may experience significant disruptions at the affected properties  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
marriott is not obligated to refer acquisition opportunities to us 
we have an investment sourcing relationship with marriott 
we believe that our investment sourcing relationship with marriott will continue to prove valuable in identifying and executing acquisitions 
however  we have not entered into a binding agreement or commitment setting forth the terms of this investment sourcing relationship 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our investment sourcing relationship will continue or will not be modified 
our ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the risk that we may have difficulty financing such properties  be forced to sell such properties for a lower price or lose such properties upon breach or termination of the ground leases 
we acquired interests in five hotels bethesda marriott suites  courtyard manhattan fifth avenue  the salt lake city marriott downtown  the westin boston waterfront hotel  and the hilton minneapolis  the parking lot associated with another hotel renaissance worthington and two golf courses associated with two additional hotels marriott griffin gate resort and oak brook hills marriott resort by acquiring a leasehold interest in land underlying the property 
we may acquire additional hotels in the future through the purchase of hotels subject to ground leases 
in the past  from time to time  secured lenders have been unwilling to lend  or otherwise charged higher interest rates  for loans secured by a leasehold mortgage compared to loans secured by a fee simple mortgage 
in addition  at any given time  investors may be disinterested in buying properties subject to a ground lease and may pay a 
table of contents lower price for such properties than for a comparable property in fee simple or they may not purchase such properties at any prices  so we may find that we will have a difficult time selling a property subject to a ground lease or may receive less proceeds from such sale 
finally  as lessee under ground leases  we are exposed to the possibility of losing the hotel  or a portion of the hotel  upon termination  or an earlier breach by us  of the ground lease  which could result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
due to restrictions in our hotel management agreements  franchise agreements  mortgage agreements and ground leases  we may not be able to sell our hotels at the highest possible price or at all 
our current hotel management agreements are long term and contain certain restrictions on selling our hotels  which may affect the value of our hotels 
the hotel management agreements that we have entered into  and those we expect to enter into in the future  contain provisions restricting our ability to dispose of our hotels which  in turn  may have an adverse affect on the value of our hotels 
our hotel management agreements generally prohibit the sale of a hotel to certain competitors of the manager  purchasers who are insufficiently capitalized  or purchasers who might jeopardize certain liquor or gaming licenses 
in addition  there are rights of first refusal in the hotel management agreement for the salt lake city marriott downtown and in both the franchise agreement and management agreement for the vail marriott mountain resort spa 
these rights of first refusal might discourage certain purchasers from expending resources to conduct due diligence and making an offer to purchase these hotels from us  thus resulting in a lower sales price 
finally  our current hotel management agreements contain initial terms ranging from ten to forty years and certain agreements have renewal periods  exercisable at the option of the property manager  of ten to forty five years 
because our hotels would have to be sold subject to the applicable hotel management agreement  the term length of a hotel management agreement may deter some potential purchasers and could adversely impact the price realized from any such sale 
to the extent we receive less sale proceeds  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
our mortgage agreements contain certain provisions that may limit our ability to sell our hotels 
in order to assign or transfer our rights and obligations under certain of our mortgage agreements  we generally must obtain the consent of the lender  pay a fee equal to a fixed percentage of the outstanding loan balance  and pay any costs incurred by the lender in connection with any such assignment or transfer 
these provisions of our mortgage agreements may limit our ability to sell our hotels which  in turn  could adversely impact the price realized from any such sale 
to the extent we receive less sale proceeds  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 
our ground leases contain certain provisions that may limit our ability to sell our hotels 
our ground lease agreements with respect to bethesda marriott suites  salt lake city marriott downtown  the westin boston waterfront hotel  and the hilton minneapolis require the consent of the lessor for assignment or transfer 
these provisions of our ground leases may limit our ability to sell our hotels which  in turn  could adversely impact the price realized from any such sale 
in addition  at any given time  investors may be disinterested in buying properties subject to a ground lease and may pay a lower price for such properties than for a comparable property in fee simple or they may not purchase such properties at any price 
accordingly  we may find it difficult to sell a property subject to a ground lease or may receive lower proceeds from any such sale 
to the extent we receive less sale proceeds  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to stockholders 

table of contents we face competition for hotel acquisitions and investments and we may not be successful in identifying or completing hotel acquisitions and investments that meet our criteria  which may impede our growth 
one component of our long term business strategy is expansion through hotel acquisitions and investments 
however  we may not be successful in identifying or completing acquisitions or investments that are consistent with our strategy 
we compete with institutional pension funds  private equity funds  reits  hotel companies and others who are engaged in hotel acquisitions and investments 
this competition for hotel investments may increase the price we pay for hotels and these competitors may succeed in acquiring those hotels that we seek to acquire 
furthermore  our potential acquisition targets may find our competitors to be more attractive suitors because they may have greater financial resources  may not be dependent on third party financing  may be willing to pay more or may have a more compatible operating philosophy 
in addition  the number of entities competing for suitable hotels may increase in the future  which would increase demand for these hotels and the prices we must pay to acquire them 
if we pay higher prices for hotels  our returns on investment and profitability may be reduced 
also  future acquisitions of hotels  hotel companies or hotel investments may not yield the returns we expect  especially if we cannot obtain financing without paying higher borrowing costs  and may result in stockholder dilution 
we may fail to successfully integrate and operate newly acquired hotels 
our ability to successfully integrate and operate newly acquired hotels is subject to the following risks we may not possess the same level of familiarity with the dynamics and market conditions of any new markets that we may enter  which could result in us paying too much for hotels in new markets  market conditions may result in lower than expected occupancy and room rates  we may acquire hotels without any recourse  or with only limited recourse  for liabilities  whether known or unknown  such as clean up of environmental contamination  claims by tenants  vendors or other persons against the former owners of the hotels and claims for indemnification by general partners  directors  officers and others indemnified by the former owners of the hotels  we may need to spend more than budgeted amounts to make necessary improvements or renovations to our newly acquired hotels  and we may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions into our existing operations 
if we cannot operate acquired hotels to meet our goals or expectations  our business  financial condition  results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be materially and adversely affected 
our success depends on senior executive officers whose continued service is not guaranteed 
we depend on the efforts and expertise of our senior executive officers to manage our day to day operations and strategic business direction 
the loss of any of their services could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
seasonality of the hotel business can be expected to cause quarterly fluctuations in our earnings 
the hotel industry is seasonal in nature 
generally  our earnings are higher in the second and fourth quarters 
as a result  we may have to enter into short term borrowings in our first and third quarters in order to offset these fluctuations in earnings and to make distributions to our stockholders 
the employee free choice act could substantially increase the cost of doing business 
we believe that if the employee free choice act is enacted  a number of our hotels could become unionized 
currently  we have only four hotels whose manager employs a unionized workforce 
in general  the wages and benefits of our non union hotels are consistent with the wages and benefits of unionized hotels in their respective markets 
however  unionized hotels are generally subject to a number of work rules that  if implemented at our non union hotels  could decrease operating margins at these hotels 
if that is the case  we believe that the unionization of our remaining hotels may result in a significant decline in the profitability and value of those hotels  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders 

table of contents we may be adversely affected by increased use of business related technology which may reduce the need for business related travel 
the increased use of teleconference and video conference technology by businesses could result in decreased business travel as companies increase the use of technologies that allow multiple parties from different locations to participate at meetings without traveling to a centralized meeting location 
to the extent that such technologies play an increased role in day to day business and the necessity for business related travel decreases  hotel room demand may decrease and our financial condition  results of operations  the market price of our common stock and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders may be adversely affected 
we may have difficulty executing our investment strategy associated with our purchase of the allerton loan 
we have no prior experience investing in mortgage loans 
as a result  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully foreclose on  or otherwise take control of  the allerton hotel  which secures the mortgage loan 
the foreclosure proceedings may also take longer than expected 
we acquired the allerton loan with the expectation of subsequently foreclosing on  or otherwise taking control of  the allerton hotel  which is securing the mortgage loan 
this investment and any other similar investment in mortgage loans that we may undertake in the future may negatively affect our financial condition due to the impact of losses from non performing loans  and they are subject to increased risks of loss  including risks associated with foreclosure 
foreclosure on a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process  which could have a substantial negative effect on our anticipated return on a foreclosed mortgage loan 
at any time prior to or during the foreclosure proceedings  the borrower may file for bankruptcy  which would have the effect of staying the foreclosure actions and further delaying the foreclosure process 
foreclosure may also create a negative public perception of the related mortgaged property  resulting in a diminution of its value 
these types of investments and associated foreclosure actions may also require a substantial amount of resources and negotiations  which may divert the attention of our management team from other activities 
if we are unable to acquire the allerton hotel  we will hold the loan as a debt investment  which is subject to  among other risks  i the risk of continued borrower default  ii the risks attendant to foreclosure  iii the risk of delays and expenses due to interposed defenses or counterclaims  and the possibility that a foreclosure sale may be challenged as a fraudulent conveyance  regardless of the parties intent  iv the risk that we may be limited in our ability to collect certain funds due to it from a borrower that is a debtor in a case filed under title of the us code  us et seq  as amended  and v the risk that the borrower may not maintain adequate insurance coverage against liability for personal injury and property damage in the event of casualty or accident 
we face risks associated with the development of a hotel by a third party developer 
on january   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire  upon completion expected in  a hotel property under development on west nd street in times square  new york city 
we are exposed to the risks associated with the failure of the third party developer to complete the development  as we expect  of the to be developed hotel described in more detail in item under recent developments 
these include the risk that the third party developer will default on its obligations under the purchase and sale agreement with us or default on an obligation to a lender  which may have a security interest in the property senior to us 
in either of these cases  we may lose the opportunity to acquire the hotel and may have no recourse to the developer 
in addition  the hotel is not expected to be opened for approximately to months 
if we acquire this hotel  there can be no assurance that the market where it is located will not be experiencing a downturn when the acquisition is completed and the hotel may not perform as we expect 
we cannot assure you that we will acquire this hotel because the proposed acquisition is subject to a variety of factors  including substantial construction completion of the hotel by the third party developer and construction of the hotel within the contractual scope 
in addition  even if we complete the acquisition of the hotel  we cannot assure you that the hotel will contain more than guest rooms because the additional rooms are subject to the receipt of required permits  approvals and consents 
risks related to the economy and credit markets the lack of availability and terms of financing could adversely impact the amounts  sources and costs of capital available to us 
the ownership of hotels is very capital intensive 
we finance the acquisition of our hotels with a mixture of equity and long term debt while we traditionally finance renovations and operating needs with cash provided from operations or with borrowings from our corporate credit facility 
typically  when we acquire a hotel  we seek a five to ten year loan secured by a mortgage on the hotel 
these loans have a large balloon payment due at their maturity 
generally  we find it more efficient to place a significant amount of debt on a 
table of contents small number of our hotels and we try to keep a significant number of our hotels unencumbered 
with the exception of borrowings under our corporate credit facility in the ordinary course of operating our business  we have only borrowed money to refinance existing debt or to acquire new hotels 
during periods of economic recession  it could be difficult for us to borrow money 
over the last years  a significant percentage of hotel loans were made by lenders who quickly sold such loans to securitized lending vehicles  such as commercial mortgage backed security cmbs pools 
if the market for new cmbs issuances results in cmbs lenders making very few loans  the debt capital available to hotel owners could be dramatically reduced 
a recession could result in declines in our average daily room rates  occupancy and revpar  and thereby have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the performance of the lodging industry has traditionally been closely linked with the general economy 
a stall in the economic recovery or a resurgent recession would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if a property s occupancy or room rates drop to the point where its revenues are insufficient to cover its operating expenses  then we would be required to spend additional funds for that property s operating expenses 
in addition  if the operating results decline at our hotels secured by mortgage debt there may not be sufficient operating profit from the hotel to cover the debt service on the mortgage 
in such a case  we may be forced to choose from a number of unfavorable options  including using corporate cash  drawing on our corporate credit facility  selling the hotel on disadvantageous terms  including an unattractive price  or defaulting on the mortgage debt and permitting the lender to foreclose 
any one of these options could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and ability to pay distributions to our stockholders 
the market price of our common stock could be volatile and could decline  resulting in a substantial or complete loss on our common stockholders investment 
the market price of our common stock has been highly volatile in the past  and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their shares  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
risks related to our debt and financing our existing indebtedness contains financial covenants that could limit our operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
our existing property level debt contains restrictions including cash management provisions that may under circumstances specified in the loan agreements prohibit our subsidiaries that own our hotels from making distributions or paying dividends  repaying loans to us or other subsidiaries or transferring any of their assets to us or another subsidiary 
failure to meet our financial covenants could result from  among other things  changes in our results of operations  the incurrence of additional debt or changes in general economic conditions 
in addition  this could cause one or more of our lenders to accelerate the timing of payments and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
the terms of our debt may restrict our ability to engage in transactions that we believe would otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
our credit facility contains financial covenants that may constrain our ability to sell assets and make distributions to our stockholders 
our corporate credit facility contains several financial covenants  the most constraining of which limits the amount of debt we may incur compared to the value of our hotels our leverage covenant and the amount of debt service we pay compared to our cash flow our debt service coverage covenant 
if we were to default under either of these covenants  the lenders may require us to repay all amounts then outstanding under our credit facility and may terminate our credit facility 
these two financial covenants constrain us from incurring material amounts of additional debt or from selling properties that generate a material amount of income 
in addition our credit facility requires that we maintain a portion of our hotels as unencumbered assets 
the pool of unencumbered assets must include the westin boston waterfront hotel  the vail marriott mountain resort spa and the conrad chicago 
during the term of the credit facility  we are prohibited from selling the westin boston waterfront hotel and may only sell the vail marriott mountain resort spa and conrad chicago under limited circumstances 

table of contents many of our existing mortgage debt agreements contain cash trap provisions that could limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
certain of our loan agreements contain cash trap provisions that may get triggered if the performance of our hotels decline further 
when these provisions are triggered  substantially all of the profit generated by our hotels is deposited directly into lockbox accounts and then swept into cash management accounts for the benefit of our various lenders 
cash is distributed to us only after certain items are paid  including deposits into leasing and maintenance reserves and the payment of debt service  insurance  taxes  operating expenses  and extraordinary capital expenditures and leasing expenses 
this could affect our liquidity and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
during the second quarter of  the courtyard manhattan midtown east lender notified us that the cash trap provisions had been triggered resulting in million being held by the lender as of december  there is refinancing risk associated with our debt 
our typical debt contains limited principal amortization  therefore the vast majority of the principal must be repaid at the maturity of the loan in a so called balloon payment 
at the maturity of these loans  the first of which is in late  assuming we do not have sufficient funds to repay the debt  we will need to refinance this debt 
if the credit environment is constrained at the time of our debt maturities  we would have a very difficult time refinancing debt 
in addition  we locked in our fixed rate debt at a point in time when we were able to obtain favorable interest rate  principal amortization and other terms 
when we refinance our debt  prevailing interest rates and other factors may result in paying a greater amount of debt service  which will adversely affect our cash flow  and  consequently  our cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
if we are unable to refinance our debt on acceptable terms  we may be forced to choose from a number of unfavorable options 
these options include agreeing to otherwise unfavorable financing terms on one or more of our unencumbered assets  selling one or more hotels at disadvantageous terms  including unattractive prices  or defaulting on the mortgage and permitting the lender to foreclose 
any one of these options could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
if we default on our secured debt in the future  the lenders may foreclose on our hotels 
all of our indebtedness  except our credit facility  is secured by single property first mortgages on the applicable property 
if we default on any of the secured loans  the lender will be able to foreclose on the property pledged to the relevant lender under that loan 
while we have maintained certain of our hotels unencumbered by mortgage debt  we have a relatively high loan to value on a number of our hotels which are subject to mortgage loans and  as a result  those mortgaged hotels may be at an increased risk of default and foreclosure 
in addition to losing the property  a foreclosure may result in recognition of taxable income 
under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  a foreclosure would be treated as a sale of the property for a purchase price equal to the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage 
if the outstanding balance of the debt secured by the mortgage exceeds our tax basis in the property  we would recognize taxable income on foreclosure even though we did not receive any cash proceeds 
as a result  we may be required to identify and utilize other sources of cash for distributions to our stockholders 
if this occurs  our financial condition  cash flow and ability to satisfy our other debt obligations or ability to pay distributions may be adversely affected 
future debt service obligations may adversely affect our operating results  require us to liquidate our properties  jeopardize our ability to make cash distributions necessary to maintain our tax status as a reit and limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in the future  we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt  including secured debt 
while borrowing costs are currently low  borrowing costs on new and refinanced debt may be more expensive 
our existing debt  and any additional debt borrowed in the future could subject us to many risks  including the risks that our cash flow from operations will be insufficient to make required payments of principal and interest or to make cash distributions necessary to maintain our tax status as a reit  we may be vulnerable to adverse economic and industry conditions  we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the repayment of our debt  thereby reducing the cash available for distribution to our stockholders  funds available for operations and capital expenditures  future investment opportunities or other purposes  the terms of any refinancing is likely not as favorable as the terms of the debt being refinanced  and 
table of contents the use of leverage could adversely affect our stock price and the ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
if we violate covenants in our future indebtedness agreements  we could be required to repay all or a portion of our indebtedness before maturity at a time when we might be unable to arrange financing for such repayment on favorable terms  if at all 
higher interest rates could increase debt service requirements on our floating rate debt  if any  and refinanced debt and could reduce the amounts available for distribution to our stockholders  as well as reduce funds available for our operations  future investment opportunities or other purposes 
we may obtain in the future one or more forms of interest rate protection in the form of swap agreements  interest rate cap contracts or similar agreements to hedge against the possible negative effects of interest rate fluctuations 
however  hedging is expensive  there is no perfect hedge  and we cannot assure you that any hedging will adequately mitigate the adverse effects of interest rate increases or that counterparties under these agreements will honor their obligations 
in addition  we may be subject to risks of default by hedging counter parties 
risks related to regulation  taxes and the environment noncompliance with governmental regulations could adversely affect our operating results 
environmental matters 
our hotels are  and the hotels we acquire in the future will be  subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws 
under these laws  courts and government agencies may have the authority to require us  as owner of a contaminated property  to clean up the property  even if we did not know of or were not responsible for the contamination 
these laws also apply to persons who owned a property at the time it became contaminated 
in addition to the costs of cleanup  environmental contamination can affect the value of a property and  therefore  an owner s ability to borrow funds using the property as collateral or to sell the property 
under the environmental laws  courts and government agencies also have the authority to require that a person who sent waste to a waste disposal facility  such as a landfill or an incinerator  pay for the clean up of that facility if it becomes contaminated and threatens human health or the environment 
a person that arranges for the disposal or treatment  or transports for disposal or treatment  a hazardous substance at a property owned by another person may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances released into the environment at that property 
furthermore  various court decisions have established that third parties may recover damages for injury caused by property contamination 
for instance  a person exposed to asbestos while staying in a hotel may seek to recover damages if he or she suffers injury from the asbestos 
lastly  some of these environmental laws restrict the use of a property or place conditions on various activities 
for example  certain laws require a business using chemicals such as swimming pool chemicals at a hotel to manage them carefully and to notify local officials that the chemicals are being used 
we could be responsible for the costs associated with a contaminated property 
the costs to clean up a contaminated property  to defend against a claim  or to comply with environmental laws could be material and could adversely affect the funds available for distribution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure you that future laws or regulations will not impose material environmental liabilities or that the current environmental condition of our hotels will not be affected by the condition of the properties in the vicinity of our hotels such as the presence of leaking underground storage tanks or by third parties unrelated to us 
we may face liability regardless of our knowledge of the contamination  the timing of the contamination  the cause of the contamination  or the party responsible for the contamination of the property 
although we have taken and will take commercially reasonable steps to assess the condition of our properties  there may be unknown environmental problems associated with our properties 
if environmental contamination exists on our properties  we could become subject to strict  joint and several liability for the contamination by virtue of our ownership interest 
in addition  we are obligated to indemnify our lenders for any liability they may incur in connection with a contaminated property 

table of contents the presence of hazardous substances or petroleum contamination on a property may adversely affect our ability to sell the property and could cause us to incur substantial remediation costs 
the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders 
americans with disabilities act and other changes in governmental rules and regulations 
under the americans with disabilities act of  or the ada  all public accommodations must meet various federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with the ada s requirements could require removal of access barriers  and non compliance could result in the us government imposing fines or private litigants winning damages 
if we are required to make substantial modifications to our hotels  whether to comply with the ada or other changes in governmental rules and regulations  our financial condition  results of operations and ability to make distributions to our stockholders could be adversely affected 
our hotel properties may contain or develop harmful mold  which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediating the problem 
when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials  mold growth may occur  particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time 
some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants 
concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing  as exposure to mold may cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms  including allergic reactions 
as a result  the presence of mold to which our hotel guests or employees could be exposed at any of our properties could require us to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected property  which would reduce our cash available for distribution 
in addition  exposure to mold by our guests or employees  management company employees or others could expose us to liability if property damage or adverse health concerns arise 
a portion of our revenues may be attributable to operations outside of the united states  which will subject us to different legal  monetary and political risks  as well as currency exchange risks  and may cause unpredictability in a significant source of our cash flows that could adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
we may acquire selective hotel properties outside of the united states 
international investments and operations generally are subject to various political and other risks that are different from and in addition to risks in us investments  including the enactment of laws prohibiting or restricting the foreign ownership of property  laws restricting us from removing profits earned from activities within the foreign country to the united states  including the payment of distributions  ie  nationalization of assets located within a country  variations in the currency exchange rates  mostly arising from revenues made in local currencies  change in the availability  cost and terms of mortgage funds resulting from varying national economic policies  changes in real estate and other tax rates and other operating expenses in particular countries  and more stringent environmental laws or changes in such laws 
in addition  currency devaluations and unfavorable changes in international monetary and tax policies could have a material adverse effect on our profitability and financing plans  as could other changes in the international regulatory climate and international economic conditions 
liabilities arising from differing legal  monetary and political risks as well as currency fluctuations could adversely affect our financial condition  operating results and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
in addition  the gross income and asset tests that we must meet to qualify as a reit may limit our ability to earn gains  as determined for federal income tax purposes  attributable to changes in currency exchange rates 
these limitations may limit our ability to invest outside of the united states or impair our ability to qualify as a reit 
any properties we invest in outside of the united states may be subject to foreign taxes 
we may invest in additional hotel properties located outside the united states 
jurisdictions outside the united states will generally impose taxes on our hotel properties and our operations within their jurisdictions 
to the extent possible  we will structure our investments and activities to minimize our foreign tax liability  but we will likely incur foreign taxes with respect to non us properties 
moreover  the requirements for qualification as a reit may preclude us from always using the structure that minimizes our foreign tax liability 
furthermore  as a reit  we and our stockholders will derive little or no benefit from the foreign tax credits arising from the foreign taxes we pay 
as a result  foreign taxes we pay will reduce our income and available cash flow 
table of contents from our foreign hotel properties  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
risks related to our status as a reit we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a reit 
we believe we are qualified to be taxed as a reit for our taxable year ended december   and we expect to continue to qualify as a reit for future taxable years  but we cannot assure you that we have qualified  or will remain qualified  as a reit 
the reit qualification requirements are extremely complex and official interpretations of the federal income tax laws governing qualification as a reit are limited 
certain aspects of our reit qualification are beyond our control 
accordingly  we cannot be certain that we will be successful in operating so that we can remain qualified as a reit 
at any time  new laws  interpretations  or court decisions may change the federal tax laws or the federal income tax consequences of our qualification as a reit 
moreover  our charter provides that our board of directors may revoke or otherwise terminate our reit election  without the approval of our stockholders  if it determines that it is no longer in our best interest to continue to qualify as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit and do not qualify for certain statutory relief provisions  or otherwise cease to be a reit  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at corporate rates 
we might need to borrow money or sell assets in order to pay any such tax 
also  we would not be allowed a deduction for dividends paid to our stockholders in computing our taxable income and we would no longer be compelled to make distributions under the code 
unless we were entitled to relief under certain federal income tax laws  we could not re elect reit status until the fifth calendar year after the year in which we failed to qualify as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit but are eligible for certain relief provisions  then we may retain our status as a reit but we may be required to pay a penalty tax  which could be substantial 
maintaining our reit qualification contains certain restrictions and drawbacks 
complying with reit requirements may cause us to forego otherwise attractive opportunities 
to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must continually satisfy tests concerning  among other things  the sources of our income  the nature and diversification of our assets  the amounts we distribute to our stockholders and the ownership of our stock 
in order to meet these tests  we may be required to forego attractive business or investment opportunities 
for example  we may not lease to our trs any hotel which contains gaming 
thus  compliance with the reit requirements may hinder our ability to operate solely to maximize profits 
to qualify as a reit we must meet annual distribution requirements 
in order to remain qualified as a reit  we generally are required to distribute at least of our reit taxable income  determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains  each year to our stockholders 
to the extent that we satisfy this distribution requirement  but distribute less than of our taxable income  we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income 
in addition  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax if the actual amount that we pay out to our stockholders in a calendar year is less than a minimum amount specified under federal tax laws 
as a result  for example  of differences between cash flow and the accrual of income and expenses for tax purposes  or of nondeductible expenditures  our reit taxable income in any given year could exceed our cash available for distribution 
accordingly  we may be required to borrow money or sell assets to make distributions sufficient to enable us to pay out enough of our taxable income to satisfy the distribution requirement and to avoid federal corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax in a particular year 
we may distribute taxable dividends that are partially payable in our common stock to satisfy our annual distribution requirement 
under the internal revenue service s revenue procedure  we may pay up to of any taxable dividend for taxable years ending on or before december  in shares of our common stock 
taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as ordinary income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for us federal income tax purposes 
as a result  a us stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received 
if a us stockholder sells the shares of common stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax  the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend  depending on the market price of our common stock at the time of the sale 
furthermore  with respect to non us stockholders  we may be required to withhold non us tax with respect to such dividends  including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in shares of our common stock 

table of contents in addition  if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our common stock in order to pay taxes owed on these dividends  it may put downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock 
the formation of our trss and trs lessees increases our overall tax liability 
our domestic trss are subject to federal and state income tax on their taxable income 
the taxable income of our trs lessees currently consists and generally will continue to consist of revenues from the hotels leased by our trs lessees plus  in certain cases  key money payments amounts paid to us by a hotel management company in exchange for the right to manage a hotel we acquire and yield support payments  net of the operating expenses for such properties and rent payments to us 
such taxes could be substantial 
our non us trss also may be subject to tax in jurisdictions where they operate 
we will be subject to a excise tax on transactions with our trss that are not conducted on an arm s length basis 
for example  to the extent that the rent paid by one of our trs lessees exceeds an arm s length rental amount  such amount potentially is subject to this excise tax 
while we believe we structure all of our leases on an arm s length basis  upon an audit  the irs might disagree with our conclusion 
you may be restricted from transferring our common stock 
in order to maintain our reit qualification  among other requirements  no more than in value of our outstanding stock may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the federal income tax laws to include certain entities during the last half of any taxable year 
in addition  the reit rules generally prohibit a manager of one of our hotels from owning  directly or indirectly  more than of our stock and a person who holds or more of our stock from also holding  directly or indirectly  more than of any such hotel management company 
to qualify for and preserve reit status  our charter contains an aggregate share ownership limit and a common share ownership limit 
generally  any shares of our stock owned by affiliated owners will be added together for purposes of the aggregate share ownership limit  and any shares of common stock owned by affiliated owners will be added together for purposes of the common share ownership limit 
if anyone transfers or owns shares in a way that would violate the aggregate share ownership limit or the common share ownership limit unless such ownership limits have been waived by our board of directors  or would prevent us from continuing to qualify as a reit under the federal income tax laws  those shares instead will be transferred to a trust for the benefit of a charitable beneficiary and will be either redeemed by us or sold to a person whose ownership of the shares will not violate the aggregate share ownership limit or the common share ownership limit 
if this transfer to a trust would not be effective to prevent a violation of the ownership restrictions in our charter  then the initial intended transfer or ownership will be null and void from the outset 
the intended transferee or owner of those shares will be deemed never to have owned the shares 
anyone who acquires or owns shares in violation of the aggregate share ownership limit  the common share ownership limit unless such ownership limits have been waived by our board of directors or the other restrictions on transfer or ownership in our charter bears the risk of a financial loss when the shares are redeemed or sold if the market price of our stock falls between the date of purchase and the date of redemption or sale 
even if we qualify as a reit  in certain circumstances  we may be subject to federal and state income taxes  which would reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
even if we qualify and maintain our status as a reit  we may be subject to federal income taxes or state taxes in various circumstances 
for example  net income from a prohibited transaction will be subject to a tax 
in addition  we may not be able to distribute all of our income in any given year  which would result in corporate level taxes  and we may not make sufficient distributions to avoid excise taxes 
we may also decide to retain certain gains from the sale or other disposition of our property and pay income tax directly on such gains 
in that event  our stockholders would be required to include such gains in income and would receive a corresponding credit for their share of taxes paid by us 
we may also be subject to us state and local and non us taxes on our income or property  either directly or at the level of our operating partnership or the other companies through which we indirectly own our assets 
in addition  we may be subject to federal  state local or non us taxes in other various circumstances 
any federal or state taxes we pay will reduce our cash available for distribution to our stockholders 
reit dividends generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates that apply to certain other corporate dividends 
tax legislation enacted at the end of extended the maximum tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income received by individuals from domestic and certain foreign corporations through however  dividends from reits generally do not qualify as qualified dividend income and  therefore  are taxed at normal ordinary income tax rates 
although this legislation does not adversely affect the taxation of reits or dividends paid by reits  the preferential rates applicable to regular corporate dividends could cause investors who are individuals to perceive investments in reits to be relatively less attractive than investments in the 
table of contents stock of non reit corporations that pay dividends  which could adversely affect the value of the stock of reits  including our common stock 
it is unclear whether this reduced tax rate will be extended beyond and if so  at what rate 
foreign investors may be subject to foreign investment real property tax act  or firpta  tax on certain distributions and on the sale of our common stock if certain exceptions do not apply 
a foreign person disposing of a us real property interest  or usrpi  including shares of a us corporation whose assets consist principally of usrpis  is generally subject to a tax  known as firpta tax  on the gain recognized on the disposition 
firpta tax does not apply  however  to the disposition of stock in a reit if the reit is a domestically controlled qualified investment entity 
a domestically controlled qualified investment entity includes a reit in which  at all times during a specified testing period  less than in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign persons 
even if we do not qualify as a domestically controlled qualified investment entity  a foreign person s sale of our common stock will generally not be subject to tax under firpta as a sale of a usrpi  provided that our common stock is regularly traded  as defined by applicable treasury regulations  on an established securities market at the time of the sale  and the selling foreign person held or less of our outstanding common stock at all times during a specified testing period 
if we were to fail to qualify as a domestically controlled qualified investment entity at a time when our common stock is not regularly traded on an established securities market  gain realized by a foreign person on a sale of our common stock would be subject to firpta tax and applicable withholding 
no assurance can be given that we will be a domestically controlled qualified investment entity or that our common stock will continue to be regularly traded on an established securities market 
additionally  any distributions we make to our foreign shareholders that are attributable to gain from the sale of any usrpi will also generally be subject to firpta tax and applicable withholding  unless our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market at the time of the distribution and the recipient did not own more than of our common stock at any time during the year preceding the distribution 
legislative or regulatory action could adversely affect our stockholders 
in recent years  numerous legislative  judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in reits and similar entities 
additional changes to applicable tax laws are likely to continue to occur in the future  and we cannot assure our stockholders that any such changes will not adversely affect the taxation of a stockholder 
any such changes could have an adverse effect on an investment in our common stock 
all stockholders are urged to consult with their tax advisors with respect to the status of legislative  regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on an investment in our common stock 
risks related to our organization and structure provisions of our charter may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company 
our charter provides that no person may beneficially own more than of the aggregate outstanding shares of our common stock or more than of the value of the aggregate outstanding shares of our capital stock  except certain look through entities  such as mutual funds  which may beneficially own up to of the aggregate outstanding shares of our common stock or up to of the value of the aggregate outstanding shares of our capital stock 
our board of directors has waived this ownership limitation for certain investors in the past 
our bylaws waive this ownership limitation for certain other classes of investors 
these ownership limitations may prevent an acquisition of control of our company by a third party without our board of directors approval  even if our stockholders believe the change of control is in their best interests 
our charter also authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of common stock and up to  shares of preferred stock  to classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common stock or preferred stock and to set the preferences  rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares 
furthermore  our board of directors may  without any action by the stockholders  amend our charter from time to time to increase or decrease the aggregate number of shares of stock of any class or series that we have authority to issue 
issuances of additional shares of stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium to the market price of our common stock or otherwise be in our stockholders best interests 
certain advance notice provisions of our bylaws may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company 
our bylaws provide that a with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders  nominations of individuals for election to our board of directors and the proposal of other business to be considered by stockholders may be made only i pursuant to our notice of the meeting  ii by the board of directors or iii by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice procedures set forth in the bylaws and b with respect to special meetings of stockholders  only the business specified 
table of contents in our notice of meeting may be brought before the meeting of stockholders and nominations of individuals for election to the board of directors may be made only a by the board of directors or b provided that the board of directors has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting  by a stockholder who is entitled to vote at the meeting and has complied with the advance notice provisions set forth in the bylaws 
these advance notice provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium to the market price of our common stock or otherwise be in our stockholders best interests 
provisions of maryland law may limit the ability of a third party to acquire control of our company 
the maryland general corporation law  or the mgcl  has certain restrictions on a business combination and control share acquisition which we have opted out of 
if an affirmative majority of votes cast by a majority of stockholders entitled to vote approve it  our board of directors may opt in to such provisions of the mgcl 
if we opt in  and the stockholders approve it  these provisions may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium price for holders of our common stock or otherwise be in their best interests 
additionally  title  subtitle of the mgcl permits our board of directors  without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in our charter or bylaws  to take certain actions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control of our company that might involve a premium to the market price of our common stock or otherwise be in our stockholders best interests 
we have entered into an agreement with each of our senior executive officers that provides each of them benefits in the event his employment is terminated by us without cause  by him for good reason  or under certain circumstances following a change of control of our company 
we have entered into an agreement with each of our senior executive officers that provides each of them with severance benefits if his employment is terminated under certain circumstances following a change of control of our company 
certain of these benefits and the related tax indemnity could prevent or deter a change of control of our company that might involve a premium price for our common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of our stockholders 
you have limited control as a stockholder regarding any changes we make to our policies 
our board of directors determines our major policies  including policies related to our investment objectives  leverage  financing  growth and distributions to our stockholders 
our board of directors may amend or revise these policies without a vote of our stockholders 
this means that our stockholders will have limited control over changes in our policies and those changes could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from our operations to make distributions to our stockholders at expected levels  and we cannot assure you of our ability to make distributions in the future 
beginning in  we intend to pay a quarterly dividend that represents of cash available for distribution 
our ability to make this intended distribution may be adversely affected by the risk factors described in this annual report on form k and other reports that we file from time to time with the sec 
in addition  our board of directors has the sole discretion to determine the timing  form and amount of any distributions to our stockholders 
our board of directors will make determinations regarding distributions based upon many facts  including our financial performance  our debt service obligations  any debt covenants  our capital expenditure requirements  the requirements for qualification as a reit and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
as a result  no assurance can be given that we will be able to make distributions to our stockholders at expected levels  or at all  or that distributions will increase or even be maintained over time  any of which could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
changes in market conditions could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
as with other publicly traded equity securities  the value of our common stock depends on various market conditions that may change from time to time 
among the market conditions that may affect the value of our common stock are the following the extent of investor interest in our securities  the general reputation of reits and the attractiveness of our equity securities in comparison to other equity securities  including securities issued by other real estate based companies  
table of contents the underlying asset value of our hotels  investor confidence in the stock and bond markets  generally  national and local economic conditions  changes in tax laws  our financial performance  and general stock and bond market conditions 
the market value of our common stock is based primarily upon the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions 
consequently  our common stock may trade at prices that are greater or less than our net asset value per share of common stock 
if our future earnings or cash distributions are less than expected  it is likely that the market price of our common stock will diminish 
further issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to current stockholders 
we may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock to raise the capital necessary to finance hotel acquisitions  refinance debt  or pay portions of future dividends 
in addition  we may issue preferred stock or units in our operating partnership  which are redeemable on a one to one basis for our common stock  to acquire hotels 
such issuances could result in dilution of stockholders equity 
future offerings of debt securities or preferred stock  which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation and for the purpose of distributions  may cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in the future  we may increase our capital resources by making additional offerings of debt or equity securities  which may include senior or subordinated notes  classes of preferred stock and or common stock 
we will be able to issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock without stockholder approval  unless stockholder approval is required by applicable law or the rules of any stock exchange or automated quotation system on which our securities may be listed or traded 
upon liquidation  holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock 
additional equity offerings could significantly dilute the holdings of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock  or both 
holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution 
preferred stock and debt  if issued  could have a preference on liquidating distributions or a preference on dividend or interest payments that could limit our ability to make a distribution to the holders of our common stock 
because our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control  we cannot predict or estimate the amount  timing or nature of our future offerings 
thus  our stockholders bear the risk of our future offerings reducing the market price of our common stock and diluting their interest

we present the following two non gaap financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating performance earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation  and amortization or ebitda  and funds from operations or ffo 
we caution investors that amounts presented in accordance with our definitions of ebitda and ffo may not be comparable to similar measures disclosed by other companies  since not all companies calculate these non gaap measures in the same manner 
ebitda and ffo should not be considered as an alternative measure of our net income loss  operating performance  cash flow or liquidity 
ebitda and ffo may include funds that may not be available for our discretionary use due to functional requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures and property acquisitions and other commitments and uncertainties 
although we believe that ebitda and ffo can enhance your understanding of our results of operations  these non gaap financial measures  when viewed individually  are not necessarily better indicators of any trend as compared to gaap measures such as net income loss or cash flow from operations 
in addition  you should be aware that adverse economic and market conditions may harm our cash flow 
under this section  as required  we include a quantitative reconciliation of ebitda and ffo to the most directly comparable gaap financial performance measure  which is net income loss

we paid of the dividend in shares of common stock and the remainder in cash as permitted by the internal revenue service s revenue procedure all of our other dividends have been paid in cash 
ffo  as defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit  is net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures which are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity  thus our presentation of ffo may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other reporting companies 
ffo is not intended to represent cash flows for the period 
ffo has not been presented as an alternative to operating income  but as an indicator of operating performance  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with 
table of contents gaap 
ffo is a supplemental industry wide measure of reit operating performance  the definition of which was first proposed by nareit in and clarified in  and 
since the introduction of the definition by nareit  the term has come to be widely used by reits 
historical gaap cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical gaap cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
accordingly  we believe ffo combined with our primary gaap presentations help improve our stockholders ability to understand our operating performance 
we only use ffo as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
the following is a reconciliation between net income loss and ffo in thousands year ended december  in thousands net loss income real estate related depreciation a gain on property disposal  net of tax ffo a amounts for the years ended december  and include million of depreciation expense included in discontinued operations 
ebitda is defined as net income loss before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we believe it is a useful financial performance measure for us and for our stockholders and is a complement to net income and other financial performance measures provided in accordance with gaap 
we use ebitda to measure the financial performance of our operating hotels because it excludes expenses such as depreciation and amortization  taxes and interest expense  which are not indicative of operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance irrespective of our capital structure or how we finance our properties and operations 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  which can vary from hotel to hotel based on a variety of factors unrelated to the hotels financial performance  we can more accurately assess the financial performance of our hotels 
under gaap  hotels are recorded at historical cost at the time of acquisition and are depreciated on a straight line basis 
by excluding depreciation and amortization  we believe ebitda provides a basis for measuring the financial performance of hotels unrelated to historical cost 
however  because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  it does not measure the capital we require to maintain or preserve our fixed assets 
in addition  because ebitda does not reflect interest expense  it does not take into account the total amount of interest we pay on outstanding debt nor does it show trends in interest costs due to changes in our borrowings or changes in interest rates 
ebitda  as calculated by us  may not be comparable to ebitda reported by other companies that do not define ebitda exactly as we define the term 
because we use ebitda to evaluate our financial performance  we reconcile it to net income loss which is the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity

table of contents overview we are a lodging focused real estate company that  as of february   owns a portfolio of premium hotels and resorts that contain  guestrooms and a senior mortgage loan secured by another hotel 
we are an owner  as opposed to an operator  of the hotels in our portfolio 
as an owner  we receive all of the operating profits or losses generated by our hotels after we pay fees to the hotel managers  which are based on the revenues and profitability of the hotels 
our vision is to be the premier allocator of capital in the lodging industry 
our mission is to deliver long term stockholder returns through a combination of dividends and long term capital appreciation 
our strategy is to utilize disciplined capital allocation and focus on acquiring  owning  and measured dispositions of high quality  branded lodging properties in north america with superior long term growth prospects in markets with high barriers to entry for new supply 
in addition  we are committed to enhancing the value of our platform by being open and transparent in our communications with investors  monitoring our corporate overhead and following sound corporate governance practices 
consistent with our strategy  we continue to focus on opportunistically investing in premium full service hotels and  to a lesser extent  premium urban limited service hotels located throughout north america 
our portfolio of hotels is concentrated in key gateway cities and in destination resort locations 
all of our hotels are operated under a brand owned by one of the leading global lodging brand companies marriott international  inc marriott  starwood hotels resorts worldwide  inc starwood or hilton worldwide hilton 
we differentiate ourselves from our competitors because of our adherence to three basic principles high quality urban and destination resort focused branded hotel real estate  conservative capital structure  and thoughtful asset management 
high quality urban and destination resort focused branded real estate we own premium hotels and resorts in north america 
these hotels and resorts are primarily categorized as upper upscale as defined by smith travel research and are generally located in high barrier to entry markets with multiple demand generators 
our properties are concentrated in five key gateway cities new york city  los angeles  chicago  boston and atlanta and in destination resort locations such as the us virgin islands and vail  colorado 
we believe that gateway cities and destination resorts will achieve higher long term growth because they are attractive business and leisure destinations 
we also believe that these locations are better insulated from new supply due to relatively high barriers to entry  including expensive construction costs and limited prime hotel development sites 
we believe that higher quality lodging assets create more dynamic cash flow growth and superior long term capital appreciation 
in addition  a core tenet of our strategy is to leverage global hotel brands 
we strongly believe in the value of powerful global brands because we believe that they are able to produce incremental revenue and profits compared to similar unbranded hotels 
dominant global hotel brands typically have very strong reservation and reward systems and sales organizations  and all of our hotels are operated under a brand owned by one of the top global lodging brand companies marriott  starwood or hilton and all but three of our hotels are managed by the brand company directly 
generally  we are interested in owning hotels that are currently operated under  or can be converted to  a globally recognized brand 
we would  however  consider owning non branded hotels in certain top tier markets or unique markets if the returns on such hotels would be higher than if the hotels were operated under a globally recognized brand 
conservative capital structure since our formation in  we have been committed to a conservative capital structure with prudent leverage 
all of our outstanding debt is fixed interest rate mortgage debt with no maturities until late we will also maintain low financial leverage by funding a portion of our acquisitions with proceeds from the issuance of equity 
we have a preference to maintain a significant portion of our portfolio as unencumbered assets in order to provide maximum balance sheet flexibility 
in addition  to the extent that we incur additional debt  our preference is limited recourse secured mortgage debt 
we expect that our strategy will enable us to maintain a balance sheet with a moderate amount of debt throughout all phases of the lodging cycle 
we believe that it is not prudent to increase the inherent risk of a highly cyclical business through a highly levered capital structure 
we prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure 
we have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any operating partnership units or preferred stock 
we endeavor to structure our hotel acquisitions so that they will not overly complicate 
table of contents our capital structure  however  we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available 
as of december   we had million of unrestricted corporate cash 
we believe that we maintain a reasonable amount of fixed interest rate mortgage debt 
as of december   we had million of mortgage debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of percent and a weighted average maturity date of approximately years  with no maturities until late in addition  we amended and restated our million unsecured credit facility in august we currently have hotels unencumbered by debt and no corporate level debt outstanding 
thoughtful asset management we believe that we are able to create significant value in our portfolio by utilizing our management team s extensive experience and our innovative asset management strategies 
our senior management team has an established broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships  including relationships with hotel owners  financiers  operators  project managers and contractors and other key industry participants 
as the economic recovery continues  we will explore strategic options to maximize the growth of our revenue and profitability 
we continue to focus our hotel managers on minimizing the increases in our property level operating expenses and we continue to maintain modest corporate expenses 
we are also continuing to work closely with our managers to optimize the mix of business at our hotels in order to maximize potential revenue 
we use our broad network of hotel industry contacts and relationships to maximize the value of our hotels 
under the federal income tax rules governing reits  we are required to engage a hotel manager that is an eligible independent contractor through one of our subsidiaries to manage each of our hotels pursuant to a management agreement 
our philosophy is to negotiate management agreements that give us the right to exert significant influence over the management of our properties  annual budgets and all capital expenditures to the extent permitted under the reit rules  and then to use those rights to continually monitor and improve the performance of our properties 
we cooperatively partner with the managers of our hotels in an attempt to increase operating results and long term asset values at our hotels 
in addition to working directly with the personnel at our hotels  our senior management team also has long standing professional relationships with our hotel managers senior executives  and we work directly with these senior executives to improve the performance of our portfolio 
we believe we can create significant value in our portfolio through innovative asset management strategies such as rebranding  renovating and repositioning 
we are committed to regularly evaluating our portfolio to determine if we can employ these value added strategies at our hotels 
key indicators of financial condition and operating performance we use a variety of operating and other information to evaluate the financial condition and operating performance of our business 
these key indicators include financial information that is prepared in accordance with gaap  as well as other financial information that is not prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  we use other information that may not be financial in nature  including statistical information and comparative data 
we use this information to measure the performance of individual hotels  groups of hotels and or our business as a whole 
we periodically compare historical information to our internal budgets as well as industry wide information 
these key indicators include occupancy percentage  average daily rate or adr  revenue per available room or revpar  earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization or ebitda  and funds from operations or ffo 
occupancy  adr and revpar are commonly used measures within the hotel industry to evaluate operating performance 
revpar  which is calculated as the product of adr and occupancy percentage  is an important statistic for monitoring operating performance at the individual hotel level and across our business as a whole 
we evaluate individual hotel revpar performance on an absolute basis with comparisons to budget and prior periods  as well as on a company wide and regional basis 
adr and revpar include only room revenue 
room revenue comprised approximately and of our total revenues for the fiscal years ended december  and  and is dictated by demand  as measured by occupancy percentage  pricing  as measured by adr  and our available supply of hotel rooms 
our adr  occupancy percentage and revpar performance may be impacted by macroeconomic factors such as regional and local employment growth  personal income and corporate earnings  office vacancy rates and business relocation decisions  airport and other 
table of contents business and leisure travel  new hotel construction and the pricing strategies of competitors 
in addition  our adr  occupancy percentage and revpar performance is dependent on the continued success of the marriott  starwood and hilton brands 
we also use ebitda and ffo as measures of the financial performance of our business 
see non gaap financial matters 
overview of in  we saw the beginning of a recovery in the lodging cycle as demand and business mix trends were positive 
business travel increased in  and as a result  key metrics showed associated improvement 
our revpar increased from the comparable period in as a result of a percentage point increase in occupancy and a percent increase in adr 
the business mix at our hotels shifted from lower rated segments to higher rated segments  such as business transient  our most profitable segment 
operating cost cutting initiatives were maintained during the year  thereby sustaining or improving profit margins 
due to debt maturities  limited new supply and a thaw in the capital and credit markets for investors with strong balance sheets  acquisition activity increased substantially in the following are significant highlights for the year ended december  hotel acquisitions 
on june   we acquired a leasehold interest in the room hilton minneapolis in minneapolis  minnesota  for total cash consideration of approximately million 
the hotel remains a hilton branded and managed property 
the hotel is the largest hotel in the state of minnesota and features  square feet of meeting space  including the largest ballroom in the state 
the hotel is located near the minneapolis convention center  and is convenient to target field and local shopping  dining  and all downtown attractions via the climate controlled skyway 
on august   we acquired the room renaissance charleston historic district hotel for total cash consideration of approximately million 
the hotel remains a renaissance branded and managed hotel 
the hotel is located in charleston s historic district and is proximate to the historical attractions  shopping and dining found in downtown charleston 
on september   we acquired the room hilton garden inn chelsea new york city located in manhattan for total cash consideration of approximately million 
the hotel is recently constructed and opened at the end of the hotel occupies a convenient location in chelsea on west th street  between th and th avenues in new york city 
the location produces leisure demand from its close proximity to prime travel destinations such as times square  the empire state building and madison square garden 
moreover  the hotel derives strong business transient demand from its central access to both midtown and downtown as well as major transportation hubs 
allerton mortgage loan 
on may   we acquired the million senior mortgage loan secured by the room allerton hotel in chicago  illinois for approximately million 
the loan matured in january and is currently in default 
the loan accrues interest at the rate of libor plus basis points  which includes percentage points of default interest 
as of december   we have received default interest payments from the borrower of approximately million 
we continue to pursue the foreclosure proceedings initially filed in april  which  if successful  would result in the company owning the hotel 
the matter may be resolved without foreclosure if the borrower repays the outstanding balance of the loan in full 
new line of credit 
on august   we amended and restated our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility 
the new credit agreement has a term of months  which may be extended for one additional year 
we also have the right to increase the amount available under the credit agreement to million with lender approval 
controlled equity offering program 
during the first quarter ended march   we completed our previously announced million controlled equity offering program by selling million shares at an average price of per share  raising net proceeds of approximately million 
follow on public offering 
we completed a follow on public offering of our common stock during the second quarter of we sold  shares of common stock  including the underwriters overallotment of  shares  at an offering price of per share 
the net proceeds to us  after deduction of offering costs  were approximately million 
outlook for historically  as key macroeconomic indicators such as gdp growth  employment  corporate earnings and investment  and travel demand improve  lodging operating fundamentals improve as well 
we expect to be the continuation of a sustained recovery 
table of contents in lodging 
we believe the strength of the recovery will reflect the current general economic outlook and business operations economic and earnings growth tempered by continued high unemployment  modest gdp growth and conservative corporate and consumer budgets 
all of these factors are impacted by prevalent economic and geopolitical uncertainty 
we expect  however  segment mix will continue to trend to higher rated business transient and corporate group segments in as such  we believe rates will increase and occupancy will stabilize in we believe improved lodging operating fundamentals in large urban markets  such as new york city and chicago  will outgrow improvement in operating fundamentals in second and third tier markets  as well as resort markets  in this early stage economic recovery 
we estimate revenue increases will outpace operating cost increases  thereby improving margins in we expect hotel sale and acquisition activity will continue to increase in hotel investors with strong balance sheets have capacity to tap into unused credit capacity by leveraging unencumbered assets and to tap into the capital markets  in order to grow their portfolios 
we believe the availability of hotels offered for sale in first tier markets at attractive prices will have peaked before the end of  if they have not already  as investors price in a sustained and substantial lodging recovery into purchase prices 
in our view  limited new supply will help operating fundamentals  but contribute to higher asking prices on hotels in first tier urban markets 
we expect the significant majority of our investments will be hotel acquisitions 
we may opportunistically target investments in debt secured by hotel properties that would otherwise meet our investment criteria with the intention of ultimately acquiring the underlying hotel property 
recent developments follow on public offering 
we completed a follow on public offering of our common stock on january  we sold  shares of our common stock  including the underwriter s option to purchase  additional shares  at an offering price of per share 
the net proceeds to us  after deduction of offering costs  were approximately million 
times square development 
on january   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire  upon completion  a hotel property under development on west nd street in times square  new york city 
upon completion by the third party developer  the hotel is expected to contain approximately to guest rooms 
the contractual purchase price will range from approximately million to million  depending upon the number of guest rooms  or approximately  per guest room 
if certain required permits  approvals and consents are obtained  the number of guest rooms could be increased to approximately guest rooms  which would result in the contractual purchase price increasing to approximately million  or  per guest room 
the purchase and sale agreement is for a fixed price which varies only by total guest rooms built and the completion date for the hotel  and we are not assuming any construction risk including not assuming the risk of construction cost overruns 
upon entering into the purchase and sale agreement  we committed to make a million deposit 
upon the completion of certain construction milestones  we will be required to make an additional deposit of million 
if certain permits  approvals and consents necessary for the hotel to contain more than guest rooms are obtained  we will be required to make an additional deposit equal to  per guest room for each guest room in excess of all deposits will be interest bearing 
we will forfeit our deposits if we do not close on the acquisition of the hotel upon substantial completion of construction  unless we do not close as a result of the seller failing to meet certain conditions  including substantial completion of the hotel within a specified time frame and construction of the hotel within the contractual scope 
we currently expect that the development of the hotel will take approximately to months with an anticipated opening date in our hotels the following table sets forth certain operating information for each of our hotels owned during the year ended december  change number of from property location rooms occupancy adr revpar revpar chicago marriott chicago  illinois  los angeles airport marriott los angeles  california  hilton minneapolis minneapolis  minnesota westin boston waterfront hotel boston  massachusetts renaissance waverly hotel atlanta  georgia salt lake city marriott downtown salt lake city  utah renaissance worthington fort worth  texas

year ended december  change occupancy percentage points adr revpar room revenue increased million from the comparable period in  which is partially due to million of revenues from our acquisitions 
the remaining increase of million at our comparable hotels was due to a percentage point increase in occupancy and percent increase in adr from the comparable period in food and beverage revenues increased million from the comparable period in  which is partially due to million of revenues from our acquisitions 
the remaining increase of million at our comparable hotels is driven by higher outlet revenue and  to a lesser extent  higher banquet revenue 
other revenues  which primarily represent spa  golf  parking and attrition and cancellation fees  decreased million at our comparable hotels from  which is primarily the result of lower attrition and cancellation fees for the year ended december  as is typical during the initial stages of a lodging recovery 
hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses consist primarily of operating expenses of our hotels  including non cash ground rent expense 
our hotel operating expenses increased million  or percent from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase includes amounts that are not comparable year over year as follows million increase from the minneapolis hilton  which was purchased on june   million increase from the charleston renaissance  which was purchased on august   and million increase from the hilton garden inn chelsea new york city  which was purchased on september  the operating expenses at our comparable hotels for the years ended december  and consisted of the following in millions 
table of contents year ended december  change rooms departmental expenses food and beverage departmental expenses other direct departmental expenses general and administrative utilities repairs and maintenance sales and marketing base management fees incentive management fees property taxes other fixed charges ground rent contractual ground rent non cash total hotel operating expenses the increase in operating expenses is due primarily to the overall increase of occupancy at our hotels as well as higher support costs at our hotels  specifically administrative and sales and marking expenses 
food and beverage expenses decreased primarily as a result of our efforts to increase profitability at our hotel restaurants and outlets 
other fixed charges increased primarily as a result of million of hurricane damage sustained at frenchman s reef from hurricane earl in late august property taxes decreased as a result of a number of successful multi year real estate tax appeals as well as lower real estate tax assessments at certain hotels 
base management fees are calculated as a percentage of total revenues and incentive management fees are based on the level of operating profit at certain hotels 
therefore  the increase in base management fees is due to the overall increase in revenues at our hotels 
the increase in incentive management fees from the comparable period in is due to the increased profit at certain of our hotels and a higher number of hotels earning an incentive management fee in as compared to depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization is recorded on our hotel buildings over years for the periods subsequent to acquisition 
depreciable lives of hotel furniture  fixtures and equipment are estimated as the time period between the acquisition date and the date that the hotel furniture  fixtures and equipment will be replaced 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased million from the comparable period in this increase includes amounts that are not comparable year over year as follows million increase from the minneapolis hilton  which was purchased on june   million increase from the renaissance charleston  which was purchased on august   and million increase from the hilton garden inn chelsea new york city  which was purchased on september  the remaining increase of million is attributable to capital expenditures at our comparable hotels during the year ended december  corporate expenses 
our corporate expenses decreased million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  corporate expenses principally consist of employee related costs  including base payroll  bonus and restricted stock 
corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs  professional fees and directors fees 
the decrease in corporate expenses is due primarily to charges of million in due to the retirement of our prior executive chairman  william w 
mccarten  and the termination of our prior executive vice president and general counsel  michael d 
schecter  partially offset by higher legal and professional fees in hotel acquisition costs 
we incurred million of hotel acquisition costs during the year ended december  associated with our acquisitions of the hilton minneapolis  the renaissance charleston  and the hilton garden inn chelsea new york city  as well as the entry into an agreement to acquire the to be developed hotel announced in january we had no acquisitions during the year ended december  interest expense

the interest expense was comprised of mortgage debt million  amortization of deferred financing costs million and interest and unused facility fees on our credit facility million 
as described below  in  we recorded million of default interest as a result of the event of default on the frenchman s reef mortgage  which we reversed in the first quarter of 
table of contents as of december   we had property specific mortgage debt outstanding on ten of our hotels 
all of our mortgage debt is fixed rate secured debt bearing interest at rates ranging from percent to percent per year 
our weighted average interest rate on all debt as of december  was percent 
interest income 
interest income increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to our average corporate cash balances being higher in  as well as the interest rates earned on corporate cash having increased slightly since income taxes 
we recorded an income tax expense of million for the year ended december  and an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the income tax expense includes million of income tax expense incurred on the million pre tax income of our taxable reit subsidiary  or trs  and foreign income tax expense of million  of which million represents the effect of the change in income tax rate related to the extension of our tax agreement discussed below  incurred on the million of pre tax income of the taxable reit subsidiary that owns frenchman s reef 
the income tax benefit was recorded on the million pre tax loss of our trs for the year ended december   offset by a foreign income tax expense of million related to the taxable reit subsidiary that owns frenchman s reef 
frenchman s reef is owned by a subsidiary that has elected to be treated as a trs  and is subject to us virgin islands usvi income taxes 
we were party to a tax agreement with the usvi that reduced the income tax rate to approximately percent 
this agreement expired in february  at which time the income tax rate increased to percent 
on december   the governor of the usvi approved an extension of our tax agreement for a period of years  retroactive to february and subject to another renewal in february the extension modified the tax exemption rates from the previous agreement 
the income tax rate we are subject to is now approximately percent  an percent exemption 
furthermore  we are now subject to a percent exemption from real estate and gross receipt taxes  which are recorded in other hotel expenses  whereas we were percent exempt under the prior agreement 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  our net loss for the year ended december  was million as compared to net income of million for the year ended december  revenues 
revenues consisted primarily of the room  food and beverage and other revenues from our hotels 
revenues for the years ended december  and consisted of the following in thousands year ended december  change rooms food and beverage other total revenues our total revenues decreased percent  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to a percent decline in revpar  driven by a percent decrease in adr and a percentage point decrease in occupancy  as well as lower food and beverage and other revenue 
all of our hotels experienced revenue declines for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   reflecting the impact of the recent economic recession on all of our markets 
the following are the key hotel operating statistics for the years ended december  and  respectively 
year ended december  change occupancy percentage points adr revpar hotel operating expenses 
hotel operating expenses consist primarily of operating expenses of our hotels  including non cash ground rent expense

the decrease from is primarily attributable to an overall decline in wages and benefits 
property taxes were the only expense category that increased in  primarily due to our westin boston waterfront hotel  which is subject to payments in lieu of property taxes based on a ramping percentage of hotel revenues until management fees are calculated as a percentage of revenues  as well as a percentage of operating profit at certain hotels 
as such  the decline in base management fees is due to the overall decline in revenues at our hotels 
we only pay incentive management fees at certain of our hotels when operating profits are above certain thresholds 
the decrease in incentive management fees from is due to the decline in operating profits at those hotels as well as a number of our hotels falling below the operating profit thresholds in compared to in  we had eight hotels earn incentive management fees as compared to two hotels in impairment of favorable lease asset 
we recorded impairment losses of million and million on the favorable leasehold asset related to our option to develop a hotel on an undeveloped parcel of land adjacent to the westin boston waterfront hotel during and  respectively 
since our acquisition of the hotel in  the fair market value of this option declined from million to million as of december  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization is recorded on our hotel buildings over years for the periods subsequent to acquisition 
depreciable lives of hotel furniture  fixtures and equipment are estimated as the time period between the acquisition date and the date that the hotel furniture  fixtures and equipment will be replaced 
our depreciation and amortization expense increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to the full year impact of increased capital expenditures in  primarily consisting of the significant capital projects at the chicago marriott and the westin boston waterfront hotel 
corporate expenses 
our corporate expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  corporate expenses principally consisted of employee related costs  including base payroll  bonus and restricted stock 
corporate expenses also include corporate operating costs  professional fees and directors fees 
the increase is principally due to two management changes during that resulted in a million charge 
first  our executive chairman  william w 
mccarten  announced his intention to retire as of december  and continue as the non executive chairman of the board in in connection with this change  our board of directors granted mr 
mccarten eligible retiree status and we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million to accelerate unrecognized stock based compensation expense 
secondly  our executive vice president and general counsel  michael d 
schecter  was terminated in december  and as a result  we recorded a charge of million 
the remainder of the increase in corporate expenses is attributable to higher stock based compensation expense in interest expense 
our interest expense increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is due primarily to million of default interest recorded as a result of the event of default on the frenchman s reef mortgage  which was partially offset by the repayment of amounts outstanding on our credit facility and the repayment of the mortgages on two of our hotels in our interest expense was comprised of interest on our mortgage debt million  amortization of deferred financing costs million and interest and unused facility fees on our credit facility million 
as of december   we had property specific mortgage debt 
table of contents outstanding on ten of our hotels 
on all of the hotels we have fixed rate secured debt  which bears interest at rates ranging from percent to percent per year 
amounts drawn under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate that fluctuates based on the level of outstanding indebtedness in relation to the value of our assets from time to time 
we did not have any draws on the credit facility as of december  our weighted average interest rate on all debt as of december  was percent 
interest income 
our interest income decreased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  although our corporate cash balances were higher in  the interest rates earned on our corporate cash were significantly lower than the rates earned in income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the income tax benefit was recorded on the million pre tax loss of our trs for the year ended december   offset by a foreign income tax expense of million related to the taxable reit subsidiary that owns the frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort 
the income tax benefit was recorded on the million pre tax loss of our trs for the year ended december   offset by foreign income tax expense of million related to the taxable reit subsidiary that owns the frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort 
liquidity and capital resources our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to fund future distributions to our stockholders to maintain our reit status as well as to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our hotels  including capital expenditures  and scheduled debt payments of interest and principal 
we currently expect that our available cash flows generally provided through net cash provided by hotel operations  existing cash balances and  if necessary  short term borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
some of our mortgage debt agreements contain cash trap provisions that are triggered when the hotel s operating results fall below a certain debt service coverage ratio 
when these provisions are triggered  all of the excess cash flow generated by the hotel is deposited directly into cash management accounts for the benefit of our lenders until a specified debt service coverage ratio is reached and maintained for a certain period of time 
such provisions due not allow the lender the right to accelerate repayment of the underlying debt 
during the second quarter of  the courtyard manhattan midtown east lender notified us that the cash trap provision had been triggered  resulting in million being held by the lender as of december  our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the costs of acquiring additional hotels  renovations  expansions and other capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our hotels  scheduled debt payments and making distributions to our stockholders 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  cash provided by operations  borrowings  issuances of additional equity or debt securities and proceeds from property dispositions 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including the state of the credit markets  our degree of leverage  the value of our unencumbered assets and borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders 
our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity and or debt securities is also dependent on a number of factors including the current state of the capital markets  investor sentiment and use of proceeds 
we may need to raise additional capital if we identify acquisition opportunities that meet our investment objectives 
our financing strategy since our formation in  we have been committed to a conservative capital structure with prudent leverage 
all of our outstanding debt is fixed interest rate mortgage debt with no maturities until late we also maintain low financial leverage by funding a portion of our acquisitions with proceeds from the issuance of equity 
we have a preference to maintain a significant portion of our portfolio as unencumbered assets in order to provide maximum balance sheet flexibility 
in addition  to the extent that we incur additional debt  our preference is limited recourse secured mortgage debt 
this strategy enables us to maintain a balance sheet with a moderate amount of debt during the lodging cycle 
we believe that it is not prudent to increase the inherent risk of a highly cyclical business through a highly levered capital structure 
we prefer a relatively simple but efficient capital structure 
we have not invested in joint ventures and have not issued any operating partnership units or preferred stock 
we endeavor to structure our hotel acquisitions so that they will not overly complicate our capital structure  however  we will consider a more complex transaction if we believe that the projected returns to our stockholders will significantly exceed the returns that would otherwise be available 
we believe that we maintain a reasonable amount of fixed interest rate mortgage debt 
as of december   we had million of mortgage debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of percent and a weighted average maturity date of 
table of contents approximately years  with no maturities until late in addition  we amended and restated our million unsecured credit facility in august we currently have hotels unencumbered by debt and no corporate level debt outstanding 
short term borrowings other than periodic borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility  we do not utilize short term borrowings to meet liquidity requirements 
we did not have any borrowings under our senior unsecured credit facility during the year ended december  senior unsecured credit facility on august   we amended and restated our million senior unsecured revolving credit facility that now expires in august the maturity date of the facility may be extended for an additional year upon the payment of applicable fees and the satisfaction of certain other customary conditions 
we also have the right to increase the amount of the facility to million with lender approval 
interest is paid on the periodic advances under the facility at varying rates  based upon libor  plus an agreed upon additional margin amount 
the applicable margin depends upon our leverage  as defined in the credit agreement  as follows leverage applicable margin less than or equal to greater than but less than greater than or equal to but less than greater than or equal to but less than greater than or equal to the facility includes a libor floor of basis points 
in addition to the interest payable on amounts outstanding under the facility  we are required to pay an amount equal to of the unused portion of the facility if the unused portion of the facility is greater than or if the unused portion of the facility is less than 
we incurred interest and unused credit facility fees on the facility of million  million  and million for the years ended   and  respectively 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the facility 
the facility contains various corporate financial covenants 
a summary of the most restrictive covenants is as follows actual at covenant december  maximum leverage ratio minimum fixed charge coverage ratio x on or before june  x on or after june  and on or before june  x on or after june  x minimum tangible net worth billion billion leverage ratio is total indebtedness  as defined in the credit agreement  divided by total asset value  defined in the credit agreement as a total cash and cash equivalents plus b the value of our owned hotels based on i until march   appraised values and ii after march   hotel net operating income divided by an capitalization rate  and c the book value of the allerton loan

tangible net worth  as defined in the credit agreement  is i total gross book value of all assets  exclusive of depreciation and amortization  less intangible assets  total indebtedness  and all other liabilities  plus ii of net proceeds from future equity issuances 
the facility requires us to maintain a specific pool of unencumbered borrowing base properties 
the unencumbered borrowing base assets are subject  among other restrictions  to the following limitations and covenants 
table of contents a minimum of five properties with an unencumbered borrowing base value  as defined  of not less than million 
the unencumbered borrowing base must include the westin boston waterfront  the conrad chicago and the vail marriott mountain resort and spa 
the conrad chicago and the vail marriott mountain resort and spa may be released from the unencumbered borrowing base upon lender approval and certain conditions 
during  we have the option of excluding the frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort from the calculation of our compliance with the corporate financial covenants during the extensive renovation and repositioning project at the hotel 
mortgage loan modification as a result of not completing certain capital projects at frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort as required by the mortgage loan secured by the hotel  we accrued million of penalty interest during the year ended december  during the fiscal quarter ended march   we amended certain provisions of the loan 
the lender provided us with a waiver for any penalty interest and an extension to december  and december  for the completion date of certain lender required capital projects 
in conjunction with the loan modification  we pre funded million for the capital projects into an escrow account and paid the lender a  modification fee 
as a result of the loan modification  we reversed the million penalty interest accrued in during the year ended december   we deposited an additional million into a lender held escrow for other renovation projects at frenchman s reef  which resulted in total lender held reserves of million at december  the lender required capital project that was required to be completed by december  was completed in november subsequent to december   we received million from the lender for completion of all those projects except the one project that is not required to be completed until december  sources and uses of cash our principal sources of cash are net cash flow from hotel operations  borrowing under mortgage debt and our credit facility and the proceeds from our equity offerings 
our principal uses of cash are acquisitions of hotel properties and notes  debt service  capital expenditures  operating costs  corporate expenses and dividends 
as of december   we had million of unrestricted corporate cash and million of restricted cash 
cash from operations 
our net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december  our cash from operations generally consists of the net cash flow from hotel operations offset by cash paid for corporate expenses  cash paid for interest  funding of lender escrow reserves and other working capital changes 
cash from investing activities 
our net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily as a result of the acquisitions of the hilton minneapolis  renaissance charleston  hilton garden inn chelsea new york city and the purchase of the allerton loan 
in addition  we made certain capital expenditures at our hotels and funded restricted cash reserves for capital expenditures 
cash from financing activities 
our net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december  the following table summarizes the significant financing activities for the year ended december  in millions transaction date description of transaction amount january payment of dividends january repurchase of shares for employee taxes march proceeds from controlled equity offering program may proceeds from follow on public offering june repurchase of shares for employee taxes august payment of amended credit facility fees dividend policy to qualify as a reit  we must distribute to our stockholders dividends at least equal to our reit taxable income so as to avoid paying corporate income tax and excise tax on our earnings other than the net earnings of our trs  including through our trs lessees  which are subject to tax at regular corporate rates and to qualify for the tax benefits afforded to reits under the code 
in order to qualify as a reit under the code  we generally must make distributions to our stockholders each year in an amount equal to at least 
table of contents of our reit taxable income  determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains  plus of the excess of our net income from foreclosure property over the tax imposed on such income by the code  minus any excess non cash income 
on january   we paid a dividend to our stockholders of record as of december  in the amount of per share  which represented of our taxable income 
we relied on the internal revenue service s revenue procedure  as amplified and superseded by revenue procedure  that allowed us to pay up to of the dividend in shares of our common stock and the remainder in cash 
we did not pay a dividend for as we did not have any reit taxable income for the year ended december  the company s board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share to record holders of our common stock as of march   which we intend to pay in april the following table sets forth the dividends on common shares for the years ended december   and dividend per payment date record date share january  december  april  march  june  june  september  september  january  december  the timing and frequency of distributions will be authorized by our board of directors and declared by us based upon a variety of factors  including our financial performance  restrictions under applicable law and our current and future loan agreements  our debt service requirements  our capital expenditure requirements  the requirements for qualification as a reit under the code and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant from time to time 
capital expenditures the management and franchise agreements for each of our hotels provide for the establishment of separate property improvement funds to cover  among other things  the cost of replacing and repairing furniture and fixtures at our hotels 
contributions to the property improvement fund are calculated as a percentage of hotel revenues 
in addition  we may be required to pay for the cost of certain additional improvements that are not permitted to be funded from the property improvement fund under the applicable management or franchise agreement 
as of december   we have set aside million for capital projects in property improvement funds  which are included in restricted cash 
funds held in property improvement funds for one hotel are typically not permitted to be applied to any other property 
although we have significantly curtailed capital expenditures at our hotels  we continue to benefit from the extensive capital investments made from to  during which time many of our hotels were fully renovated 
we spent approximately million on capital improvements during the year ended december   of which approximately million was funded from corporate cash 
we completed a comprehensive evaluation of a major capital investment program at the frenchman s reef morning star marriott beach resort and are undertaking a million renovation and repositioning program in order to enhance the guest experience 
the repositioning program is projected to include the following key elements reinvented pool the company plans a major redesign of the pool with state of the art features  including multiple pools  cascading waterfalls  bali beds  a sundeck and a new swim up bar 
guestroom renovation each of the guestrooms and bathrooms is expected to feature new modern design elements to enhance lighting  comfort and feel 
a renowned interior design firm is the designer for the new guestrooms and bathrooms 
spa upgrade and expansion the company plans to reinvent and double the size of the existing spa 
the plans incorporate the creation of a dedicated spa pool and additional treatment rooms 
infrastructure improvements the company intends to invest million to comprehensively redesign the mechanical plant to allow the hotel to generate its own electricity  improve air flow in common spaces and replace packaged terminal air conditioners in the guestrooms with a central system 
these enhancements are expected to greatly reduce the energy consumption and cost per kilowatt hour and generate a significant return on investment while improving guest comfort 

table of contents other resort upgrades in addition to the above  the company intends to provide for upgrades to the food and beverage outlets  renovation of the main ballroom  balcony upgrades  renovations to the boat dock and improvements to other facilities designed to enhance the guest experience 
we expect the majority of the renovation and repositioning program will occur during the summer of when we will close two of the resort s four buildings approximately guestrooms during the seasonally slow period between may and september 
during this time  we expect renovation disruption to operations resulting from the partial closure  decreasing the company s revenues by approximately million and ebitda by approximately million compared to the comparable period in we intend to fund the renovation and repositioning program from available corporate cash and  if necessary  borrowings under our credit facility 
marriott has agreed  pursuant to a non binding term sheet  to fund a portion of the expense  demonstrating its commitment to frenchman s reef 
in addition to funding from marriott and existing escrow reserves  we expect our total cash expenditure to be approximately million over the next two years 
elements of the renovation and repositioning program began during the third quarter of in order to take advantage of the low occupancy summer months  we started several projects in the sea cliff tower in august  including installation of a new roof  tile surrounds in the guest bathrooms and balcony upgrades 
the hotel was damaged by hurricane earl  which impacted the us virgin islands during the sea cliff construction in late august the remediation costs related to the damage caused by hurricane earl were below our insurance policy deductible for damages from a named windstorm event 
we incurred million during the second fiscal half of to remediate damages from hurricane earl 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
non gaap financial measures we use the following two non gaap financial measures that we believe are useful to investors as key measures of our operating performance ebitda and ffo 
these measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance in accordance with gaap 
ebitda represents net income loss excluding interest expense  provision for income taxes  including income taxes applicable to sale of assets  and depreciation and amortization 
we believe ebitda is useful to an investor in evaluating our operating performance because it helps investors evaluate and compare the results of our operations from period to period by removing the impact of our capital structure primarily interest expense and our asset base primarily depreciation and amortization from our operating results 
in addition  covenants included in our indebtedness use ebitda as a measure of financial compliance 
we also use ebitda as one measure in determining the value of hotel acquisitions and dispositions 
year ended december  in thousands net loss income interest expense income tax expense benefit real estate related depreciation ebitda we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which defines ffo as net income loss determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures which are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
we believe that the presentation of ffo provides useful information to investors regarding our operating performance because it is a measure of our operations without regard to specified non cash items  such as real estate depreciation and amortization and gain or loss on sale of assets 
we also use ffo as one measure in determining our results after taking into account the impact of our capital structure 
year ended december  in thousands net loss income real estate related depreciation ffo 
table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the diamondrock hospitality company and all consolidated subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates investment in hotels 
acquired hotels  land improvements  building and furniture  fixtures and equipment and identifiable intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value 
additions to property and equipment  including current buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment are recorded at cost 
property and equipment are depreciated using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of to years for buildings and land improvements and one to ten years for furniture and equipment 
identifiable intangible assets are typically related to contracts  including ground lease agreements and hotel management agreements  which are recorded at fair value 
above market and below market contract values are based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair market contract rates for corresponding contracts 
contracts acquired that are at market do not have significant value 
we typically enter into a new hotel management agreement based on market terms at the time of acquisition 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data 
management also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we review our investments in hotels for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the investments in hotels may not be recoverable 
events or circumstances that may cause us to perform a review include  but are not limited to  adverse changes in the demand for lodging at our properties due to declining national or local economic conditions and or new hotel construction in markets where our hotels are located 
when such conditions exist  management performs an analysis to determine if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows from operations and the proceeds from the ultimate disposition of an investment in a hotel exceed the hotel s carrying value 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  an adjustment to reduce the carrying value to the estimated fair market value is recorded and an impairment loss recognized 
revenue recognition 
hotel revenues  including room  golf  food and beverage  and other hotel revenues  are recognized as the related services are provided 
additionally  our operators collect sales  use  occupancy and similar taxes at our hotels which are excluded from revenue in our consolidated statements of operations revenue is recorded net of such taxes 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based employee compensation using the fair value based method of accounting 
we record the cost of awards with service conditions and market conditions based on the grant date fair value of the award 
for awards based on market conditions  the grant date fair value is derived using an open form valuation model 
the cost of the award is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the new rate is enacted 
we have elected to be treated as a reit under the provisions of the code and  as such  generally are not subject to federal income tax  provided we distribute all of our taxable income annually to our stockholders and comply with certain other requirements 
in addition to paying federal and state income tax on any retained income  we are subject to taxes on built in gains on sales of certain assets 
additionally  our taxable reit subsidiaries are subject to federal  state  local and or foreign income tax 

table of contents note receivable 
we initially record acquired notes receivable at cost 
notes receivable are evaluated for collectability and if collectability of the original amounts due is in doubt  the value is adjusted for impairment 
our impairment analysis considers the anticipated cash receipts as well as the underlying value of the collateral 
if collectability is in doubt  the note is placed in non accrual status 
no interest is recorded on such notes until the timing and amounts of cash receipts can be reasonably estimated 
we record cash payments received on non accrual notes receivable as a reduction in basis we continually assess the current facts and circumstances to determine whether we can reasonably estimate cash flows 
if we can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of cash flows to be collected  then income recognition becomes possible 
inflation operators of hotels  in general  possess the ability to adjust room rates daily to reflect the effects of inflation 
however  competitive pressures may limit the ability of our management companies to raise room rates 
seasonality the operations of hotels historically have been seasonal depending on location  and accordingly  we expect some seasonality in our business 
historically  we have experienced approximately two thirds of our annual income in the second and fourth fiscal quarters 
new accounting pronouncements there are no new unimplemented accounting pronouncements that are expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
contractual obligations the following table outlines the timing of payment requirements related to the consolidated mortgage debt and other commitments of our operating partnership as of december  payments due by period less than to to total year years years after years in thousands long term debt obligations including interest operating lease obligations ground leases and office space total on january   we entered into a purchase and sale agreement to acquire  upon completion  a hotel property under development on west nd street in times square  new york city 
upon completion by the third party developer  the hotel is expected to contain approximately to guest rooms 
the contractual purchase price will range from approximately million to million  depending upon the number of guest rooms  or approximately  per guest room 
if certain required permits  approvals and consents are obtained  the number of guest rooms could be increased to approximately guest rooms  which would result in the contractual purchase price increasing to approximately million  or  per guest room 
the purchase and sale agreement is for a fixed price which varies only by total guest rooms built and the completion date for the hotel  and we are not assuming any construction risk including not assuming the risk of construction cost overruns 
upon entering into the purchase and sale agreement  we committed to make a million deposit 
upon the completion of certain construction milestones  we will be required to make an additional deposit of million 
if certain permits  approvals and consents necessary for the hotel to contain more than guest rooms are obtained  we will be required to make an additional deposit equal to  per guest room for each guest room in excess of all deposits will be interest bearing 
we will forfeit our deposits if we do not close on the acquisition of the hotel upon substantial completion of construction  unless we do not close as a result of the seller failing to meet certain conditions  including substantial completion of the hotel within a specified time frame and construction of the hotel within the contractual scope 
we currently expect that the development of the hotel will take approximately to months with an anticipated opening date in 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes risks that arise from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and other market changes that affect market sensitive instruments 
in pursuing our business strategies  the primary market risk to which we are currently exposed  and which we expect to be exposed in the future  is interest rate risk 
as of december   all of our outstanding debt was fixed rate and therefore not exposed to interest rate risk
