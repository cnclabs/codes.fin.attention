item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our company and our business overview we are one of the largest owners  managers and developers of high quality student housing properties in the united states in terms of beds owned and under management 
we are a fully integrated  self managed and self administered equity reit with expertise in the acquisition  design  financing  development  construction management  leasing and management of student housing properties 
property portfolio as of december   our total property portfolio contained student housing properties with approximately  beds in approximately  apartment units  all of which we manage 
our communities contain modern housing units and are supported by a resident assistant system and other student oriented programming  with many offering resort style amenities 
as of december   our property portfolio included wholly owned properties  which consisted of owned off campus properties that are in close proximity to colleges and universities in states and four owned on campus properties  two of which were under construction as of december  the net operating income of these student housing communities  which is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate community performance  is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets  which drives our rental rates and occupancy levels and is affected by our ability to control operating costs 
our overall operating performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of our newly developed and acquired student housing communities 
our primary business objectives are to create long term stockholder value by accessing capital on cost effective terms  deploying that capital to develop  redevelop and acquire student housing communities and selling communities when they no longer meet our long term investment strategy and when market conditions are favorable 
the construction of our four owned on campus properties is funded with our equity through the ace program which enables colleges and universities to preserve their credit capacity to fund core academic infrastructure 
each of these properties operate under a ground facility lease with a related university system 
additionally  we participate with two university systems in the ownership of four on campus properties under long term ground facility leases  we refer to these properties as our on campus participating properties 
third party development and management services we also provide development and construction management services for student housing properties owned by universities  c foundations and others 
our clients have included some of the nation s most prominent systems of higher education  including the state university of new york system  the university of california system  the university of houston system  the texas a m university system  the texas state university system  the university of georgia system  the university of north carolina system  the purdue university system  the university of colorado system  and the west virginia university system 
we have developed student housing properties for these clients and a majority of the time have been retained to manage these properties following their opening 
since  we have developed and assisted in securing financing for third party student housing properties 
as of december   we were under contract on two projects that are currently in progress and whose fees range from million to million 
as of december   fees of approximately million remained to be earned by us with respect to these projects  which have scheduled completion dates of august as of december   we owned a noncontrolling interest in one joint venture that owned one student housing property with approximately beds in approximately units 
we also provided third party management and leasing services for properties that represented approximately  beds in approximately  units  nine of which we developed 
our third party management and leasing services are typically provided pursuant to management contracts that have initial terms that range from one to five years 
as of december   our total owned  joint venture and third party managed portfolio was comprised of properties that represented approximately  beds in approximately  units 
we believe that the ownership and operation of student housing communities in close proximity to selected colleges and universities presents an attractive long term investment opportunity for our investors 
we intend to continue to execute our strategy of identifying existing differentiated  typically highly amenitized  student housing communities or development opportunities in close proximity to university campuses with high barriers to entry which are projected to experience substantial increases in enrollment and or are under serviced in terms of existing on and or off campus student housing 
while fee revenue from our third party development  construction management and property management services allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities  this area has over time become a smaller portion of our operations due to the continued focus on and growth of our wholly owned property portfolio 
nevertheless  we believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify  close  and successfully operate student housing properties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in our consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized all available information  including its past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated and combined financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome anticipated by management in formulating its estimates may not be realized 
application of the critical accounting policies below involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies 
revenue and cost recognition of third party development and management services development revenues are generally recognized based on a proportionate performance method based on contract deliverables  while construction revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method  as determined by construction costs incurred relative to total estimated construction costs 
for projects where our fee is based on a fixed price  any cost overruns incurred during construction  as compared to the original budget  will reduce the net fee generated on those projects 
incentive fees are generally recognized when the project is complete and performance has been agreed upon by all parties  or when performance has been verified by an independent third party 
we also evaluate the collectability of fee income and expense reimbursements generated through the provision of development and construction management services based upon the individual facts and circumstances  including the contractual right to receive such amounts in accordance with the terms of the various projects  and reserve any amounts that are deemed to be uncollectible 
pre development expenditures such as architectural fees  permits and deposits associated with the pursuit of third party and owned development projects are expensed as incurred  until such time that management believes it is probable that the contract will be executed and or construction will commence 
because we frequently incur these pre development expenditures before a financing commitment and or required permits and authorizations have been obtained  we bear the risk of loss of these pre development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or we are unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations 
as such  management evaluates the status of third party and owned projects that have not yet commenced construction on a periodic basis and expenses any deferred costs related to projects whose current status indicates the commencement of construction is unlikely and or the costs may not provide future value to us in the form of revenues 
such write offs are included in third party development and management services expenses in the case of third party development projects or general and administrative expenses in the case of owned development projects on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
third party management fees are generally received and recognized on a monthly basis and are computed as a percentage of property receipts  revenues or a fixed monthly amount  in accordance with the applicable management contract 
incentive management fees are recognized when the contractual criteria have been met 
student housing rental revenue recognition and accounts receivable student housing rental revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
ancillary and other property related income is recognized in the period earned 
in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable  we analyze the aging of resident receivables  historical bad debts  and current economic trends 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income  as an increase in our allowance for doubtful accounts reduces our net income 
allocation of fair value to acquired properties the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors  including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  favorable or unfavorable financing  and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes  among other items  determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  in place tenant leases  and any debt assumed from the seller 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
our calculation methodology is summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of in place tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to in place tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases generally less than one year 
long lived assets impairment on a periodic basis  management is required to assess whether there are any indicators that the value of our real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is considered impaired if management s estimate of the aggregate future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
these estimates of cash flows consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property  thereby reducing our net income 
capital expenditures we distinguish between capital expenditures necessary for the ongoing operations of our properties and acquisition related improvements incurred within one to two years of acquisition of the related property 
acquisition related improvements are expenditures that have been identified at the time the property is acquired  and which we intended to incur in order to position the property to be consistent with our physical standards 
we capitalize non recurring expenditures for additions and betterments to buildings and land improvements 
in addition  we generally capitalize expenditures for exterior painting  roofing  and other major maintenance projects that substantially extend the useful life of the existing assets 
the cost of ordinary repairs and maintenance that do not improve the value of an asset or extend its useful life are charged to expense when incurred 
planned major repair  maintenance and improvement projects are capitalized when performed 
in some circumstances  lenders require us to maintain a reserve account for future repairs and capital expenditures 
these amounts are classified as restricted cash on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as the funds are not available to us for current use 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december  and december  the following table presents our results of operations for the years ended december  and  including the amount and percentage change in these results between the two periods 
year ended december  change change revenues wholly owned properties on campus participating properties third party development services third party management services resident services total revenues operating expenses wholly owned properties on campus participating properties third party development and management services general and administrative depreciation and amortization ground facility leases total operating expenses operating income nonoperating income and expenses interest income interest expense amortization of deferred financing costs loss from unconsolidated joint ventures other nonoperating income total nonoperating expenses income loss before income taxes and discontinued operations income tax provision income loss from continuing operations discontinued operations loss attributable to discontinued operations loss from disposition of real estate total discontinued operations net income loss income attributable to noncontrolling interests net income loss attributable to common shareholders wholly owned properties operations revenues from our wholly owned properties for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  increased by million primarily due to the acquisition of properties from two of our unconsolidated joint ventures in september and november  the improved lease up for the academic year  the acquisition of three properties in march  july and december  and the completion of construction of barrett honors college in august operating expenses increased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  primarily due to the same factors which affected the increase in revenues 
new property operations 
our new properties for the year ended december  as compared to year ended december  consist of the following i properties acquired in september and december from two joint ventures in which we previously held a interest  ii jefferson nd avenue  acquired in december  iii sanctuary lofts  acquired in july  iv campus trails  a property that experienced significant property damage in april as a result of a fire in which beds were destroyed and are currently in the process of being rebuilt  v university heights  acquired in march  and vi barrett honors college at arizona state university  which completed construction and opened for occupancy in august these new properties contributed an additional million of revenues and an additional million of operating expenses during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december same store property operations excluding new property activity 
we had properties containing  beds which were operating during both years ended december  and these properties produced revenues of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in average occupancy from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december  future revenues will be dependent on our ability to maintain our current leases in effect for the academic year and our ability to obtain appropriate rental rates and desired occupancy for the academic year at our various properties during our leasing period  which typically begins in january and ends in august 
at these existing same store properties  operating expenses increased by million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to increased utilities costs as a result of higher occupancy at the properties and maintenance costs incurred during the year ended december  as compared with these increases were offset by a decrease in marketing costs incurred during the prior year in order to stimulate leasing velocity for the academic year 
we anticipate that operating expenses for our same store property portfolio in will increase slightly as compared with as a result of general inflation 
on campus participating properties ocpp operations we had four participating properties containing  beds which were operating during both years ended december  and revenues from our participating properties increased to million during the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily a result of an increase in average rental rates during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year  as well as an increase in average occupancy from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  at these properties  operating expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense 
we anticipate that operating expenses in will increase slightly as compared with as a result of general inflation 
third party development services revenue third party development services revenue increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to million of revenue earned during the year ended december  related to our participation in cost savings on the university of california irvine phase iii project  which completed construction and opened for occupancy in august during the year ended december   we had four projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately million  as compared to the year ended december  in which we had five projects in progress with an average contractual fee of approximately million 
closing of third party development services projects during will be dependent upon the company s university clients obtaining project financing  which has been adversely affected by current capital market conditions 
development services revenues are dependent on our ability to successfully be awarded such projects  the amount of the contractual fee related to the project and the timing and completion of the development and construction of the project 
in addition  to the extent projects are completed under budget  we may be entitled to a portion of such savings  which are recognized as revenue when performance has been agreed upon by all parties  or when performance has been verified by an independent third party 
it is possible that projects for which we have deferred pre development costs will not close and that we will not be reimbursed for such costs 
the pre development costs associated therewith will ordinarily be charged against income for the then current period 
third party management services revenue third party management services revenue decreased by million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we experienced a decrease in management services revenue of million during the year ended december  as a result of our september and november purchases of a property portfolio from joint ventures in which we previously held a interest 
this decrease was offset by additional revenue of million related to our hampton roads property  which completed the final phase of construction in july the remainder of the variance is due to contracts that terminated during and  offset by new contracts obtained during the same periods 
we anticipate third party management services revenue to decrease in primarily as a result of lost management fee revenue related to the property portfolio purchased from joint ventures in september and november  as well as the discontinuation of a large management contract at the university of central florida in january that contributed million of management fees during the year ended december  resident services revenue revenue from resident services increased by million  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to additional revenue earned from the properties acquired during third party development and management services expenses third party development and management services expenses increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of approximately million in reserves recorded during the year ended december  on predevelopment costs incurred for third party development projects and accounts receivable from third party management contracts 
additionally  we incurred an additional million of expense during the year ended december  related to a third party development project at boise state university that did not move forward using us as developer due to the university s decision to proceed with building a portion of the project themselves utilizing traditional university debt 
we anticipate third party development and management services expenses to decrease in as a result of less activity in our management services segment due to the properties acquired from our joint ventures with fidelity in september and november  as well as an anticipated decrease in reserves recorded on predevelopment costs for third party development projects and accounts receivable from third party management contracts 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of million of acquisition related costs such as broker fees  due diligence costs and legal and accounting fees incurred for property acquisitions completed during the year ended december  we anticipate general and administrative expenses to increase in as a result of increased salary and benefits expense  including restricted stock award amortization  increased public company expenses  anticipated increases in travel related expenditures and general inflationary increases 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to the following items i additional depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million recorded during the year ended december  related to the acquisition of a property portfolio from two joint ventures in which we previously held a interest in september and november  ii additional depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million recorded during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in related to renovation projects completed during and at several of the properties acquired from gmh  and iii the opening of barrett honors college in august and three other properties acquired in march  july and december  which contributed an additional million of depreciation and amortization expense during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
these increases were offset by amortization expense of approximately million related to the value assigned to in place leases at the properties acquired from gmh  which was fully amortized by the end of we expect depreciation and amortization expense to increase in as a result of properties acquired during and the anticipated completion of three owned development projects  currently under construction  scheduled to open for occupancy in august ground facility leases ground facility leases expense increased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to improved operating results at our on campus participating properties  which increased our share of the cash flow available for distribution 
we anticipate ground facility leases expense to increase slightly in as a result of improved operations at our on campus participating properties and the completion of construction and commencement of operations of another ace development project in august interest expense interest expense decreased by million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  we experienced a decrease in interest expense of approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in as a result of mortgage loans paid off during and this decrease was offset by additional interest of million incurred during the year ended december  related to loans assumed on the properties we purchased from two joint ventures in september and november  an additional million in interest expense incurred during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year related to our freddie mac revolving credit facility entered into in september  and an additional million of interest expense incurred during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year related to the timing of draws and paydowns on our million revolving credit facility 
in addition  interest expense increased as a result of a decrease in capitalized interest of million during the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to the timing and volume of construction activities on our owned development projects during the respective periods 
the remaining decrease in interest expense during the year ended december  is primarily a result of scheduled repayments of principal on our amortizing mortgage debt 
we expect interest expense to decrease in due to the payoff of mortgage debt in and mortgage debt scheduled to mature in  and an increase in capitalized interest associated with our increased owned development activity  offset by additional interest expense incurred in connection with loans assumed on the properties acquired from two joint ventures in and additional interest expense incurred from anticipated borrowings on our corporate level debt 
amortization of deferred financing costs amortization of deferred financing costs increased approximately million  from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due to an additional million of finance cost amortization incurred during the year ended december  related to the refinancing of our revolving credit facility in august and the freddie mac revolving credit facility entered into in september we also incurred an additional million of amortization of finance costs incurred to assume debt on the properties acquired from two joint ventures in these increases were offset by a decrease in finance cost amortization of million as a result of mortgage loans paid off during and we expect amortization of deferred financing costs in to increase slightly as a result of debt assumed in connection with our acquisition of properties in september and november  offset by mortgage loans paid off in and loss from unconsolidated joint ventures loss from unconsolidated joint ventures represents our share of the net loss from the hampton roads military housing joint venture in which we have a minimal economic interest  as well as our share of the loss from two joint ventures with fidelity 
in september and november  we acquired the full ownership interests in properties previously owned by the fidelity joint ventures 
subsequent to the acquisition  the properties containing  beds are now wholly owned and are consolidated by us 
one property containing beds was not acquired by us and will continue to be owned by one of the fidelity joint ventures 
loss from unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately million from million during the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily a result of our purchase of the full ownership interests in joint venture properties in september and november  as more fully described above 
other nonoperating income other nonoperating income of million for the year ended december  represents the following items i a million gain recorded as a result of remeasuring our equity method investments in two joint ventures  in which we previously held a interest  to fair value immediately prior to our september and november acquisitions of the remaining interest in properties previously owned by the joint ventures  and ii a gain on insurance settlement of million related to a fire that occurred at one of our owned off campus properties in april the gain represents insurance proceeds received in excess of the book value of the property written off as a result of the fire damage 
other nonoperating income of million for the year ended december  represents tax incentive amounts received in cash in excess of our estimate of the future potential benefit of the tax incentive recorded upon acquisition of a property located in ypsilanti  michigan

this increase was primarily due to operating cash flows provided from the timing of the acquisition of the gmh student housing business on june  and the completion of construction and opening of vista del sol and villas at chestnut ridge in august and barrett honors college in august investing activities investing activities utilized approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash utilized in investing activities during the year ended december  related primarily to a million decrease in the use of cash to acquire properties and undeveloped land 
we acquired a total of properties during the year ended december  and no properties during the year ended december  in june  we used approximately million of cash to acquire the gmh student housing business  including properties containing  beds located in various markets throughout the country 
we also experienced a million decrease in cash used to fund the construction of our wholly owned development properties 
during the year ended december   one wholly owned property was under development  which was completed and opened for occupancy in august  while three properties were under development during the year ended december   two of which were completed and opened for occupancy in august these decreases in cash utilized in investing activities were offset by a million increase in cash used for capital expenditures at our wholly owned properties during the year ended december   as we continued with renovations at several gmh properties 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily a result of the following i the may equity offering which raised million  net of offering costs  as compared to million  net of offering costs  raised in our april equity offering  ii the million senior secured term loan which was fully funded on june   the proceeds of which were used to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition of gmh  iii the contribution of gmh student housing properties in to a joint venture in which we received million in proceeds and retained a equity interest in the joint venture  iv a million decrease in proceeds from construction loans used to fund the construction of vista del sol  an owned ace development property  and villas at chestnut ridge  an owned off campus development property  which both opened for occupancy in august  v the pay off of million in mortgage and construction loan debt that matured during the year ended december   as compared to the pay off of million in mortgage loan debt during the year ended december   vi a million increase in proceeds net of paydowns received from our secured revolving credit facilities as a result of us closing a million secured agency facility in september  of which we borrowed million at closing  and vii a million increase in distributions to stockholders as a result of issuances of common stock in our april and may equity offerings and as partial consideration for the acquisition of gmh in structure of owned on campus properties under our ace program  we have entered into four ground facility leases with three university systems to finance  construct  and manage four student housing properties 
under the terms of these ground facility leases  the university systems own the land and typically the improvements  and we make rent payments to the university systems that consist of fixed and variable rent payments that are dependent upon the operating performance of the properties 
structure of on campus participating properties at our on campus participating properties  the subject universities own both the land and improvements 
we then have a leasehold interest under a ground facility lease 
under the lease  we receive an annual distribution representing of these properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses which includes our management fees  debt service which includes repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
we also manage these properties under multi year management agreements and are paid a management fee representing of receipts 
we do not have access to the cash flows and working capital of these participating properties except for the annual net cash distribution as described above 
additionally  a substantial portion of these properties cash flow is dedicated to capital reserves required under the applicable property indebtedness and to the amortization of such indebtedness 
these amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties since our interest  including our right to share in the net cash available for distribution from the properties  terminates upon the amortization of their indebtedness 
our economic interest in these properties is therefore limited to our interest in the net cash flow and management and development fees from these properties  as reflected in our calculation of funds from operations modified ffom contained herein 
accordingly  when considering these properties contribution to our operations  we focus upon our share of these properties net cash available for distribution and the management fees that we receive from these properties  rather than upon their contribution to our gross revenues and expenses for financial reporting purposes 
the following table reflects the amounts related to our on campus participating properties included in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december    and year ended december  revenues direct operating expenses amortization amortization of deferred financing costs ground facility lease net operating income interest income interest expense net income excludes property management fees of million for the year ended december  and million for each of the years ended december  and this expense and the corresponding fee revenue recognized by us have been eliminated in consolidation 
also excludes the allocation of expenses related to corporate management and oversight 
represents the universities share of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service including payment of principal and capital expenditures 
liquidity and capital resources cash balances and liquidity as of december   excluding our on campus participating properties  we had million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as of december  restricted cash primarily consists of escrow accounts held by lenders and resident security deposits  as required by law in certain states 
this increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the completion of our equity offering in august  which generated net proceeds of approximately million 
we used approximately million of offering proceeds to paydown the outstanding balance to on our secured revolving credit facility and an additional million of cash proceeds to pay off mortgage debt 
in september and november  we used approximately million of offering proceeds to acquire full ownership interest in properties owned in two joint ventures in which we previously held a ownership interest 
in december  we used approximately million of offering proceeds to acquire a property in gainesville  florida 
finally  we used these offering proceeds to fund development costs on our four wholly owned development projects 
as of december   our short term liquidity needs included  but were not limited to  the following i anticipated distribution payments to our common and restricted stockholders totaling approximately million based on an assumed annual cash distribution of per share based on the number of our shares outstanding as of december   ii anticipated distribution payments to our operating partnership unitholders totaling approximately million based on an assumed annual distribution of per common unit of limited partnership interest common unit and a cumulative preferential per annum cash distribution rate of on our preferred units of limited partnership interest series a preferred units based on the number of units outstanding as of december   iii the pay off of approximately million of fixed rate mortgage debt scheduled to mature during the next months  iv the pay off of a million construction loan scheduled to mature in december  v development costs over the next months totaling approximately million for four wholly owned properties currently under construction  and vi funds for other potential development projects 
we have a million senior secured term loan scheduled to mature in may we expect to extend the maturity date through may by exercising the remaining month extension option available to us 
in addition  we have a million revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in august that is currently secured by of our wholly owned properties and a million secured revolving credit facility with a freddie mac lender scheduled to mature in september that is currently secured by of our wholly owned properties 
we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements by i borrowing under our existing secured revolving credit facilities discussed above  ii potentially disposing of properties depending on market conditions  iii issuing securities  including common stock  under our million atm equity program  and iv utilizing net cash provided by operations 
we may seek additional funds to undertake initiatives not contemplated by our business plan or obtain additional cushion against possible shortfalls 
we also may pursue additional financing as opportunities arise 
future financings may include a range of different sizes or types of financing  including the incurrence of additional secured debt and the sale of additional debt or equity securities 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our ability to obtain additional financing depends on several factors  including future market conditions  our success or lack of success in penetrating our markets  our future creditworthiness  and restrictions contained in agreements with our investors or lenders  including the restrictions contained in the agreements governing our revolving credit facilities and term loan 
these financings could increase our level of indebtedness or result in dilution to our equity holders 
equity offering on august   we completed an equity offering  consisting of the sale of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  including  shares issued as a result of the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option in full at closing 
the offering generated gross proceeds of million 
the aggregate proceeds  net of the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering  were approximately million 
atm equity program in may  we announced the establishment of an at the market share offering program the atm equity program through which we may issue and sell  from time to time  shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million 
actual sales under the program will depend on a variety of factors  including  but not limited to  market conditions  the trading price of our common stock and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding 
during the year ended december   we sold approximately million shares at weighted average price of per share for net proceeds of approximately million after payment of approximately million of commissions to the sales agents 
we may continue to sell shares of common stock under this program from time to time based on market conditions  although we are not under an obligation to sell any shares 
as of december   we had approximately million available for issuance under this program 
secured revolving credit facility the operating partnership has a million revolving credit facility that may be expanded by up to an additional million upon the satisfaction of certain conditions 
the maturity date of the facility is august  and can be extended months through august as of december   the facility was secured by of our wholly owned properties 
availability under the revolving credit facility is limited to an aggregate borrowing base amount equal to the lesser of i to of the value of certain properties  calculated as set forth in the credit facility  and ii the adjusted net operating income from these properties divided by a formula amount 
the facility bears interest at a variable rate  at our option  based upon a base rate or one  two  or three month libor  with a libor floor of  plus  in each case  a spread based upon our total leverage 
additionally  we are required to pay an unused commitment fee of per annum 
in august  we paid down the entire balance on the facility using proceeds from our equity offering 
as of december   total availability under the facility totaled approximately million 
the terms of the facility include certain restrictions and covenants  which limit  among other items  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  liens  and the disposition of assets 
the facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and also contains financial covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain certain minimum ratios of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to fixed charges and total indebtedness 
we may not pay distributions that exceed a specified percentage of funds from operations  as adjusted  for any four consecutive quarters 
the financial covenants also include consolidated net worth and leverage ratio tests 
as of december   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
secured agency facility we have a million secured revolving credit facility with a freddie mac lender 
the facility has a five year term and is currently secured by properties referred to as the collateral pool 
the facility bears interest at one or three month libor plus a spread that varies based on the debt service ratio of the collateral pool 
additionally  we are required to pay an unused commitment fee of per annum 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the facility totaled million  bearing interest at a weighted average annual rate of 
the secured agency facility includes some  but not all  of the same financial covenants as the secured revolving credit facility  described above 
senior secured term loan the operating partnership has a million senior secured term loan that matures on may  and can be extended through may through the exercise of a month extension option 
the secured term loan bears interest at a variable rate  at our option  based upon a base rate or one  two  three  or six month libor plus  in each case  a spread based upon our total leverage 
as of december   the balance outstanding on the secured term loan was million 
on february   we entered into two million interest rate swap agreements effective march  through february   which are both used to hedge our exposure to fluctuations in interest payments on its libor based senior secured term loan 
under the terms of the two interest rate swap agreements  we pay an average fixed rate of and receive one month libor floating rate 
as a result of these two interest rate swaps  we have effectively fixed the interest rate on our senior secured term loan to as of december  spread 
in the event that the swaps at any time have a negative fair value below a certain threshold level  we could be required to post cash into a collateral account pledged to the interest rate swap providers 
as of december   we had deposited approximately million into a collateral account related to one of the interest rate swaps 
refer to note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein for a more detailed discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities 
distributions we are required to distribute of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains on an annual basis in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes 
distributions to common stockholders are at the discretion of the board of directors 
we may use borrowings under our secured revolving credit facility to fund distributions 
the board of directors considers a number of factors when determining distribution levels  including market factors and our company s performance in addition to reit requirements 
on january   we declared a fourth quarter distribution per share of  which was paid on february  to all common stockholders of record as of february  at the same time  the operating partnership paid an equivalent amount per unit to holders of common units  as well as the quarterly cumulative preferential distribution to holders of series a preferred units 
recurring capital expenditures our properties require periodic investments of capital for general capital expenditures and improvements 
our policy is to capitalize costs related to the acquisition  development  rehabilitation  construction  and improvement of properties  including interest and certain internal personnel costs related to the communities under rehabilitation and construction 
capital improvements are costs that increase the value and extend the useful life of an asset 
ordinary repair and maintenance costs that do not extend the useful life of the asset are expensed as incurred 
recurring capital expenditures represent non incremental building improvements required to maintain current revenues and typically include appliances  carpeting and flooring  hvac equipment  kitchen bath cabinets  new roofs  site improvements and various exterior building improvements 
non recurring capital expenditures include expenditures that were taken into consideration when underwriting the purchase of a property which were considered necessary to bring the property up to operating standard  and incremental improvements that include  among other items community centers  new windows  and kitchen bath apartment upgrades 
additionally  we are required by certain of our lenders to contribute amounts to reserves for capital repairs and improvements at their mortgaged properties 
these annual contributions may exceed the amount of capital expenditures actually incurred in such year at such properties 
our historical recurring capital expenditures at our wholly owned properties are set forth below as of and for the year ended december  average beds total recurring capital expenditures average per bed pre development expenditures our third party and owned development activities have historically required us to fund pre development expenditures such as architectural fees  permits and deposits 
the closing and or commencement of construction of these development projects is subject to a number of risks such as our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms and delays or refusals in obtaining necessary zoning  land use  building  and other required governmental permits and authorizations as such  we cannot always predict accurately the liquidity needs of these activities 
we frequently incur these pre development expenditures before a financing commitment and or required permits and authorizations have been obtained 
accordingly  we bear the risk of the loss of these pre development expenditures if financing cannot ultimately be arranged on acceptable terms or we are unable to successfully obtain the required permits and authorizations 
historically  our third party and owned development projects have been successfully structured and financed  however  these developments have at times been delayed beyond the period initially scheduled  causing revenue to be recognized in later periods 
as of december   we have deferred approximately million in pre development costs related to third party and owned development projects that have not yet commenced construction 
indebtedness as of december   we had approximately  million of outstanding consolidated indebtedness excluding net unamortized debt discounts and debt premiums of approximately million and million  respectively  comprised of a million balance on our senior secured term loan  million balance on our secured agency facility   million in mortgage and construction loans secured by our wholly owned properties  million in mortgage loans secured by two phases of an on campus participating property  and million in bond issuances secured by three of our on campus participating properties 
the weighted average interest rate on our consolidated indebtedness as of december  was per annum 
as of december   approximately of our total consolidated indebtedness was variable rate debt  comprised of our secured agency facility and vista del sol construction loan discussed below 
wholly owned properties the weighted average interest rate of the  million of wholly owned mortgage and construction debt was per annum as of december  each of the mortgage loans is a non recourse obligation subject to customary exceptions 
the loans generally may not be prepaid prior to maturity  in certain cases prepayment is allowed  subject to prepayment penalties 
the development and construction for vista de sol  an owned on campus property  was partially financed with a million construction loan 
we have the option of choosing the prime rate or one  two  or three month libor plus 
the loan requires payments of interest only during the term of the loan and any accrued interest and outstanding borrowings become due on the maturity date 
in october  we elected to exercise the remaining month extension option available to us  which extended the maturity date to december as of december   the balance outstanding on the construction loan totaled million  bearing interest at a rate of per annum 
on campus participating properties three of our on campus participating properties are financed with million of outstanding project based taxable bonds 
under the terms of these financings  one of our special purpose subsidiaries publicly issued three series of taxable bonds and loaned the proceeds to three special purpose subsidiaries that each hold a separate leasehold interest 
although a default in payment by these special purpose subsidiaries could result in a default under one or more series of bonds  the indebtedness of any of these special purpose subsidiaries is not cross defaulted or cross collateralized with indebtedness of the company  the operating partnership or other special purpose subsidiaries 
repayment of principal and interest on these bonds is insured by mbia  inc the loans encumbering the leasehold interests are non recourse  subject to customary exceptions 
the cullen oaks phase i and phase ii on campus participating properties are currently encumbered by mortgage loans with balances as of december  of approximately million and million  respectively 
the loans mature in february and bear interest at a rate of libor plus 
in connection with these loans  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective february  through february   that is designated to hedge our exposure to fluctuations on interest payments attributed to changes in interest rates associated with payments on the loans 
under the terms of the interest rate swap agreement  we pay a fixed rate of per annum and receive a floating rate of libor plus 
pursuant to the leases  in the event the leasehold estate does not achieve financial break even defined as revenues less operating expenses  excluding management fees  less debt service  the applicable lessor would be required to make a rental payment  also known as the contingent payment  sufficient to achieve financial break even 
the contingent payment provision remains in effect until such time as any financing placed on the facilities would receive an investment grade rating without the contingent payment provision 
in the event that the lessor is required to make a contingent payment  future net cash flow distributions would be first applied to repay such contingent payments and then to unpaid management fees prior to normal distributions 
we have guaranteed payment of this property s indebtedness 
the weighted average interest rate of the indebtedness encumbering our on campus participating properties was at december  off balance sheet items as discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein  we continue to hold a equity interest in an unconsolidated joint venture with mortgage debt outstanding of approximately million as of december  our operating partnership serves as non recourse  carve out guarantor of this debt  which means we are liable to the lender for any loss  damage  cost  expense  liability  claim or other obligation incurred by the lender arising out of or in connection with certain non recourse exceptions in connection with the debt 
pursuant to the limited liability company agreement  the joint venture agreed to indemnify  defend and hold harmless the operating partnership with respect to such obligations  except to the extent such obligations were caused by the willful misconduct  gross negligence  fraud or bad faith of the operating partnership or its employees  agents or affiliates 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  total thereafter long term debt owned development projects operating leases capital leases long term debt obligations reflect the payment of both principal and interest 
for long term obligations with a variable interest rate  the rate in effect at december  was assumed to remain constant over all periods presented 
assumes we do not exercise the month extension option available to us on our million senior secured term loan  which is more fully discussed in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
consists of the completion costs related to villas at babcock  villas on sycamore and lobo village  which will be funded entirely by us and are each scheduled to be completed in august also includes completion costs related to the portland state university project which is scheduled to be completed in august this project will be partially funded by us and partially financed with a construction loan 
the amounts above do not include the portion of costs to be financed with the construction loan 
we have entered into a contract with a general contractor for certain phases of the construction of these projects 
however  these contracts do not generally cover all of the costs that are necessary to place these properties into service  including the cost of furniture and marketing and leasing costs 
the unfunded commitments presented include all such costs  not only those costs that we are obligated to fund under the construction contracts 
includes minimum annual lease payments under the ground facility leases for university village temple  university centre  vista del sol  barrett honors college  lobo village and our portland state university project 
funds from operations as defined by nareit  ffo represents income loss before allocation to noncontrolling interests computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of loan origination costs and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we present ffo because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our operating performance and believe it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
ffo is intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  it provides a performance measure that  when compared year over year  reflects the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
further  ffo does not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our financial performance or to cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our ffo to our net income loss attributable to common shareholders year ended december  net income loss attributable to common shareholders noncontrolling interests loss from disposition of real estate loss from unconsolidated joint ventures ffo from unconsolidated joint ventures real estate related depreciation and amortization funds from operations ffo ffo per share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding diluted represents our share of the ffo from three joint ventures in which we are or were a noncontrolling partner 
includes the hampton roads military housing joint venture in which we have a minimal economic interest as well as our noncontrolling interest in two joint ventures fund ii and fund iii formed or assumed as part of the company s acquisition of gmh 
while our on campus participating properties contributed million  million and million to our revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  under our participating ground leases  we and the participating university systems each receive of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service which includes significant amounts towards repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
a substantial portion of our revenues attributable to these properties is reflective of cash that is required to be used for capital expenditures and for the amortization of applicable property indebtedness 
these amounts do not increase our economic interest in these properties or otherwise benefit us since our interest in the properties terminates upon the repayment of the applicable property indebtedness 
as noted above  ffo excludes gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets because these gaap items assume that the value of real estate diminishes over time 
however  unlike the ownership of our wholly owned properties  the unique features of our ownership interest in our on campus participating properties cause the value of these properties to diminish over time 
for example  since the ground facility leases under which we operate the participating properties require the reinvestment from operations of specified amounts for capital expenditures and for the repayment of debt while our interest in these properties terminates upon the repayment of the debt  such capital expenditures do not increase the value of the property to us and mortgage debt amortization only increases the equity of the ground lessor 
accordingly  when considering our ffo  we believe it is also a meaningful measure of our performance to modify ffo to exclude the operations of our on campus participating properties and to consider their impact on performance by including only that portion of our revenues from those properties that are reflective of our share of net cash flow and the management fees that we receive  both of which increase and decrease with the operating measure of the properties  a measure referred to herein as ffom 
this narrower measure of performance measures our profitability for these properties in a manner that is similar to the measure of our profitability from our services business where we similarly incur no initial or ongoing capital investment in a property and derive only consequential benefits from capital expenditures and debt amortization 
we believe  however  that this narrower measure of performance is inappropriate in traditional real estate ownership structures where debt amortization and capital expenditures enhance the property owner s long term profitability from its investment 
we also exclude impairment charges from ffom  as we believe the inclusion of such charges is inconsistent with the treatment of gains and losses on the disposition of real estate  which are not included in ffo 
additionally  we believe that excluding impairment charges from ffom more appropriately presents the operating performance of the company s real estate investments on a comparative basis 
funds from operations modified ffom year ended december  funds from operations elimination of operations of on campus participating properties and unconsolidated joint venture net income from on campus participating properties amortization of investment in on campus participating properties ffo from hampton roads unconsolidated joint venture modifications to reflect operational performance of on campus participating properties our share of net cash flow management fees impact of on campus participating properties gain on remeasurement of equity method investments elimination of provision for asset impairment wholly owned property elimination of provision for asset impairments unconsolidated joint ventures gain on insurance settlement funds from operations modified ffom ffom per share diluted weighted average common shares outstanding diluted our share of the ffo from the hampton roads military housing unconsolidated joint venture is excluded from the calculation of the ffom  as management believes this amount does not accurately reflect the company s participation in the economics of this transaction 
of the properties net cash available for distribution after payment of operating expenses  debt service including repayment of principal and capital expenditures 
amounts represent actual cash received for the year to date periods 
as a result of using accrual based results in interim periods and cash based results for year to date periods  the sum of reported interim results may not agree to annual cash received 
represents non cash gains recorded to remeasure the company s equity method investments in fund ii and fund iii to fair value as a result of the company purchasing fidelity s interest in properties previously owned through the joint ventures in september and november represents an impairment charge recorded during the three months ended march  for campus walk oxford  a property that was sold in april although impairment charges are included in the calculation of net income loss and ffo  the company excludes such charges from ffom because it believes the inclusion of such charges is inconsistent with the treatment of gains and losses on the disposition of real estate  which are not included in ffo 
additionally  the company believes that excluding impairment charges from ffom more appropriately presents the operating performance of the company s real estate investments on a comparative basis 
represents our share of impairment charges recorded during the periods presented for properties owned through our unconsolidated fidelity joint ventures 
represents a gain on insurance settlement related to significant property damage resulting from a fire that occurred at one of our wholly owned properties in april our ffom may have limitations as an analytical tool because it reflects the unique contractual calculation of net cash flow from our on campus participating properties  which is different from that of our off campus owned properties 
additionally  ffom reflects features of our ownership interests in our on campus participating properties that are unique to us 
companies that are considered to be in our industry may not have similar ownership structures  and therefore those companies may not calculate a ffom in the same manner that we do  or at all  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap and ffo results and using our modified ffo only supplementally 
inflation our leases do not typically provide for rent escalations 
however  they typically do not have terms that extend beyond months 
accordingly  although on a short term basis we would be required to bear the impact of rising costs resulting from inflation  we have the opportunity to raise rental rates at least annually to offset such rising costs 
however  a weak economic environment or declining student enrollment at our principal universities may limit our ability to raise rental rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use fixed and floating rate debt to finance acquisitions  developments and maturing debt 
these borrowings expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common stockholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common stockholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
at december  and we had fixed rate debt of million and million  respectively excluding net unamortized debt discounts and debt premiums 
holding other variables constant such as debt levels  a one percentage point increase in interest rates basis points would cause a million and million decline in the fair value of our fixed rate debt as of december  and  respectively 
conversely  a one percentage point decrease in interest rates would cause a million and million increase in the fair value of our fixed rate debt as of december  and  respectively 
due to the structure of our floating rate debt and interest rate protection instruments  the impact of a one percentage point increase or decrease in interest rates on our net income to common stockholders and cash flows would not be significant at december  or all of our outstanding indebtedness is effectively fixed rate except for our secured revolving credit facilities and our vista del sol construction loan 
our secured agency facility had an outstanding balance of million at december  and bears interest at one or three month libor plus a spread that varies based on the debt service ratio of the collateral pool 
the vista del sol construction loan had an outstanding balance of million at december  and bears interest at the lender s prime rate or libor plus  at our election 
we have in place two million interest rate swap agreements  designated as cash flow hedges  which effectively fix the interest rate on the outstanding balance of the senior secured term loan at plus a spread based upon our total leverage  through maturity in may in addition  we have in place an interest rate swap agreement  designated as a cash flow hedge  which effectively fixes the interest rate on the outstanding balance of the cullen oaks phase i and phase ii mortgage loans at through maturity in we anticipate incurring additional variable rate indebtedness in the future  including draws under our secured revolving credit facilities and construction loans 
we may in the future use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to such variable rate borrowings 
we do not  and do not expect to  use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes  and we expect to enter into contracts only with major financial institutions
