item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we currently have ongoing litigation with fletcher in delaware regarding issues involving our series d preferred stock 
for more information regarding our litigation with fletcher  see item legal proceedings 
shares of our common stock are also subject to certain demand and piggyback registration rights held by laitram  llc we also may enter into additional registration rights agreements in the future in connection with any subsequent acquisitions or securities transactions we may undertake 
any sales of our common stock under these registration rights arrangements with laitram or other stockholders could be negatively perceived in the trading markets and negatively affect the price of our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market under these arrangements  or the expectation of such sales  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
a depressed economic and credit environment and lower natural gas prices could have an adverse effect on customer demand for certain of our products and services  which in turn would adversely affect our results of operations  our cash flows  our financial condition  our ability to borrow and our stock price 
global market and economic conditions weakened significantly beginning in mid the global recession contributed to weakened demand and lower prices for natural gas on a worldwide basis  which reduced the levels of exploration for natural gas 
historically  demand for our products and services has been 
table of contents sensitive to the level of exploration spending by e p companies and geophysical contractors 
the demand for our products and services will be reduced if exploration expenditures remain low 
during periods of reduced levels of exploration for oil and natural gas  there have been oversupplies of seismic data and downward pricing pressures on our seismic products and services  which in turn  have limited our ability to meet sales objectives and maintain profit margins for our products and services 
in the past  these then prevailing industry conditions have had the effect of reducing our revenues and operating margins 
the markets for oil and gas historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be so in the future 
turmoil or uncertainty in the credit markets and its potential impact on the liquidity of major financial institutions may have an adverse effect on our ability to fund our business strategy through borrowings under either existing or new debt facilities in the public or private markets and on terms we believe to be reasonable 
likewise  there can be no assurance that our customers will be able to borrow money on a timely basis or on reasonable terms  which could have a negative impact on their demand for our products and impair their ability to pay us for our products and services on a timely basis  or at all 
our sales are affected by interest rate fluctuations and the availability of liquidity  and we would be adversely affected by increases in interest rates or liquidity constraints 
rising interest rates may also make certain alternative products and services provided by our competitors more attractive to customers  which could lead to a decline in demand for our products and services 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
it is difficult to predict how long the economic slowdown will persist  whether it will deteriorate further  and which of our products and services will be adversely affected 
we may have further impairment losses if events or changes in circumstances occur which reduce the fair value of an asset below its carrying amount 
as a result  these conditions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  and we may be subject to increased disputes and litigation because of these events and issues 
stock markets  in general  have experienced in recent years  and may continue to experience  significant price and volume volatility  and the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
if capital expenditures for e p companies remain at reduced levels compared to prior periods  the demand for our products and services may remain weak and our results of operations will be adversely affected 
demand for our products and services depends upon the level of spending by e p companies and seismic contractors for exploration and development activities  and those activities depend in large part on oil and gas prices 
spending on products and services such as those we provide our customers are of a highly discretionary nature and subject to rapid and material change 
any significant decline in oil and gas related spending on behalf of our customers could cause alterations in our capital spending plans  project modifications  delays or cancellations  general business disruptions or delays in payment  or non payment of amounts that are owed to us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and on our ability to continue to satisfy all of the covenants in our loan agreements 
additionally  increases in oil and gas prices may not increase demand for our products and services or otherwise have a positive effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
oil and gas companies willingness to explore  develop and produce depends largely upon prevailing industry conditions that are influenced by numerous factors over which our management has no control  such as the supply of and demand for oil and gas  the level of prices  and expectations about future prices  of oil and gas  the cost of exploring for  developing  producing and delivering oil and gas  the expected rates of declining current production  the discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves  
table of contents weather conditions  including hurricanes  that can affect oil and gas operations over a wide area  as well as less severe inclement weather that can preclude or delay seismic data acquisition  domestic and worldwide economic conditions  political instability in oil and gas producing countries  technical advances affecting energy consumption  government policies regarding the exploration  production and development of oil and gas reserves  the ability of oil and gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing  and merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas companies and seismic contractors 
many of our products contain more advanced technologies than certain products that our competition offer  and these products may tend to be  for that reason  more expensive than products of our competitors  thereby giving them a pricing advantage 
although we believe that the long term trend is favorable  the level of oil and gas exploration and production activity has been volatile in recent years 
previously forecasted trends in oil and gas exploration and development activities may not continue and demand for our products and services may not reflect the level of activity in the industry 
any prolonged substantial reduction in oil and gas prices would likely affect oil and gas production levels and therefore adversely affect demand for the products and services we provide 
we derive a substantial amount of our revenues from foreign operations and sales  which pose additional risks 
sales to customers outside of north america accounted for approximately of our consolidated net revenues for  and we believe that export sales will remain a significant percentage of our revenue 
us export restrictions affect the types and specifications of products we can export 
additionally  to complete certain sales  us laws may require us to obtain export licenses  and we cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulty in obtaining these licenses 
like many energy service companies  we have operations in and sales into certain international areas  including parts of the middle east  west africa  latin america  asia pacific and the commonwealth of independent states  that are subject to risks of war  political disruption such as the recent political turmoil in egypt  civil disturbance  political corruption  possible economic and legal sanctions such as possible restrictions against countries that the us government may deem to sponsor terrorism and changes in global trade policies 
our sales or operations may become restricted or prohibited in any country in which the foregoing risks occur 
in particular  the occurrence of any of these risks could result in the following events  which in turn  could materially and adversely impact our results of operations disruption of oil and natural gas e p activities  restriction of the movement and exchange of funds  inhibition of our ability to collect receivables  enactment of additional or stricter us government or international sanctions  limitation of our access to markets for periods of time  expropriation and nationalization of assets of our company or those of our customers  political and economic instability  which may include armed conflict and civil disturbance  currency fluctuations  devaluations  and conversion restrictions  confiscatory taxation or other adverse tax policies  and governmental actions that may result in the deprivation of our contractual rights 

table of contents our international operations and sales increase our exposure to other countries restrictive tariff regulations  other import export restrictions and customer credit risk 
in addition  we are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions and the final determination of our tax liabilities involves the interpretation of the statutes and requirements of taxing authorities worldwide 
our tax returns are subject to routine examination by taxing authorities  and these examinations may result in assessments of additional taxes  penalties and or interest 
our operating results may fluctuate from period to period  and we are subject to seasonality factors 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations from period to period as a result of new product or service introductions  the timing of significant expenses in connection with customer orders  unrealized sales  levels of research and development activities in different periods  the product mix sold  and the seasonality of our business 
because many of our products feature a high sales price and are technologically complex  we generally have experienced long sales cycles for these products and historically incur significant expense at the beginning of these cycles for component parts and other inventory necessary to manufacture a product in anticipation of a future sale  which may not ultimately occur 
in addition  the revenues from our sales can vary widely from period to period due to changes in customer requirements and demand 
these factors can create fluctuations in our net revenues and results of operations from period to period 
variability in our overall gross margins for any period  which depend on the percentages of higher margin and lower margin products and services sold in that period  compounds these uncertainties 
as a result  if net revenues or gross margins fall below expectations  our results of operations and financial condition will likely be adversely affected 
additionally  our business can be seasonal in nature  with strongest demand typically in the fourth calendar quarter of each year 
customer budgeting cycles at times result in higher spending activity levels by our customers at different points of the year 
while the fourth quarter of was strong  the fourth quarter of was not as strong as seen historically because the typical discretionary spending that normally occurs during the fourth quarter was not realized 
due to the relatively high sales price of many of our products and seismic data libraries and relatively low unit sales volume  our quarterly operating results have historically fluctuated from period to period due to the timing of orders and shipments and the mix of products and services sold 
this uneven pattern makes financial predictions for any given period difficult  increases the risk of unanticipated variations in our quarterly results and financial condition  and places challenges on our inventory management 
delays caused by factors beyond our control  such as the granting of permits for seismic surveys by third parties  the effect from disasters such as the deepwater horizon incident in the gulf of mexico and the availability and equipping of marine vessels  can affect our solutions segment s revenues from its processing and iss services from period to period 
also  delays in ordering products or in shipping or delivering products in a given period could significantly affect our results of operations for that period 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause greater volatility in the market price of our common stock 
we invest significant sums of money in acquiring and processing seismic data for our solutions multi client data library 
we invest significant amounts in acquiring and processing new seismic data to add to our solutions multi client data library 
a majority of these investments are funded by our customers  while the remainder is recovered through future data licensing fees 
in  we invested million in our multi client data library 
our customers generally commit to licensing the data prior to our initiating a new data library acquisition program 
however  the aggregate amounts of future licensing fees for this data are sometimes uncertain and depend on a variety of factors  including the market prices of oil and gas  customer demand for seismic data in the library  and the availability of similar data from competitors 
for example  the deepwater horizon incident in the gulf of mexico in april adversely affected our library sales in the second quarter of  likewise  it is very possible that our processing activities could be affected by the continued slow pace of exploration and development activity in the us gulf of mexico 

table of contents by making these investments in acquiring and processing new seismic data for our solutions multi client library  we are exposed to the following risks we may not fully recover our costs of acquiring and processing seismic data through future sales 
the ultimate amounts involved in these data sales are uncertain and depend on a variety of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the timing of these sales is unpredictable and can vary greatly from period to period 
the costs of each survey are capitalized and then amortized as a percentage of sales and or over the expected useful life of the data 
this amortization will affect our earnings and  when combined with the sporadic nature of sales  will result in increased earnings volatility 
regulatory changes that affect companies ability to drill  either generally or in a specific location where we have acquired seismic data  could materially adversely affect the value of the seismic data contained in our library 
technology changes could also make existing data sets obsolete 
additionally  each of our individual surveys has a limited book life based on its location and oil and gas companies interest in prospecting for reserves in such location  so a particular survey may be subject to a significant decline in value beyond our initial estimates 
the value of our multi client data could be significantly adversely affected if any material adverse change occurs in the general prospects for oil and gas exploration  development and production activities 
the cost estimates upon which we base our pre commitments of funding could be wrong 
the result could be losses that have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
these pre commitments of funding are subject to the creditworthiness of our clients 
in the event that a client refuses or is unable to pay its commitment  we could incur a substantial loss on that project 
as part of our asset light strategy  we routinely charter vessels from third party vendors to acquire seismic data for our multi client business 
as a result  our cost to acquire our multi client data could significantly increase if vessel charter prices rise materially 
any reduction in the market value of such data will require us to write down its recorded value  which could have a significant material adverse effect on our results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets that we have recorded in connection with our acquisitions are subject to impairment evaluations and  as a result  we could be required to write off additional goodwill and intangible assets  which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with accounting standard codification asc topic  goodwill and other intangible assets asc  we are required to compare the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets when certain impairment indicators under asc are present to their carrying amount 
if the fair value of such goodwill or intangible assets is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of these assets within the reporting units is less than their carrying value 
in  we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our goodwill and intangible assets and in we recorded an impairment charge of million related to our intangible assets 
any further reduction in or impairment of the value of our goodwill or other intangible assets will result in additional charges against our earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our reported results of operations and financial position in future periods 
at december   our goodwill and other intangible asset balances were million and million  respectively 
due to the international scope of our business activities  our results of operations may be significantly affected by currency fluctuations 
we derive a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues from international sales  subjecting us to risks relating to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
currency variations can adversely affect margins on sales of our products in countries outside of the united states and margins on sales of products that include 
table of contents components obtained from suppliers located outside of the united states 
through our subsidiaries  we operate in a wide variety of jurisdictions  including the united kingdom  china  canada  the netherlands  brazil  russia  the united arab emirates and other countries 
certain of these countries have experienced economic problems and uncertainties from time to time 
to the extent that world events or economic conditions negatively affect our future sales to customers in these and other regions of the world  or the collectability of receivables  our future results of operations  liquidity and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we currently require customers in certain higher risk countries to provide their own financing 
in some cases  we have assisted our customers in organizing international financing and export import credit guarantees provided by the united states government 
we do not currently extend long term credit through notes to companies in countries we consider to be too risky from a credit risk perspective 
a majority of our foreign net working capital is within the united kingdom 
the subsidiaries in the united kingdom and in other countries receive their income and pay their expenses primarily in their local currencies 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in their local currencies  a devaluation of those currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars 
for financial reporting purposes  such depreciation will negatively affect our reported results of operations since earnings denominated in foreign currencies that are converted to us dollars are stated at a decreased value 
in addition  since we participate in competitive bids for sales of certain of our products and services that are denominated in us dollars  a depreciation of the us dollar against other currencies could harm our competitive position relative to other companies 
while we have employed economic cash flow and fair value hedges designed to minimize the risks associated with these exchange rate fluctuations  the hedging activities may be ineffective or may not offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from currency variations 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that fluctuations in the values of the currencies of countries in which we operate will not materially adversely affect our future results of operations 
as a technology focused company  we are continually exposed to risks related to complex  highly technical products and services 
our customers often require demanding specifications for performance and reliability of our products and services 
because many of our products are complex and often use unique advanced components  processes  technologies  and techniques  undetected errors and design and manufacturing flaws may occur 
even though we attempt to assure that our systems are always reliable in the field  the many technical variables related to their operations can cause a combination of factors that can  and have from time to time  caused performance and service issues with certain of our products 
product defects result in higher product service  warranty  and replacement costs and may affect our customer relationships and industry reputation  all of which may adversely impact our results of operations 
despite our testing and quality assurance programs  undetected errors may not be discovered until the product is purchased and used by a customer in a variety of field conditions 
if our customers deploy our new products and they do not work correctly  our relationship with our customers may be materially and adversely affected 
as a result of our systems advanced and complex nature  we expect to experience occasional operational issues from time to time 
generally  until our products have been tested in the field under a wide variety of operational conditions  we cannot be certain that performance and service problems will not arise 
in that case  market acceptance of our new products could be delayed and our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the businesses of our solutions and software segments  being more concentrated in software  processing services  and proprietary technologies  have also exposed us to various risks that these technologies typically encounter  including the following future competition from more established companies entering the market  technology obsolescence  dependence upon continued growth of the market for seismic data processing  
table of contents the rate of change in the markets for these segments technology and services  research and development efforts not proving sufficient to keep up with changing market demands  dependence on third party software for inclusion in these segments products and services  misappropriation of these segments technology by other companies  alleged or actual infringement of intellectual property rights that could result in substantial additional costs  difficulties inherent in forecasting sales for newly developed technologies or advancements in technologies  recruiting  training  and retaining technically skilled personnel that could increase the costs for these segments  or limit their growth  and the ability to maintain traditional margins for certain of their technology or services 
we are exposed to risks relating to the effectiveness of our internal controls 
following the end of our third quarter of  we discovered an error in revenue recognition of certain product revenues in connection with the delivery of a firefly land seismic data acquisition system and related hardware and components in china  which we had recorded in revenues for the second quarter of on november   we announced that we were restating our unaudited consolidated financial statements as of and for the three and six month periods ended june   as a result of this error 
we had concluded that  as of june   our internal control over financial reporting was not effective because this error in revenue recognition necessitating the restatement of our second quarter results of operations constituted a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
this material weakness was remediated as of december  a material weakness is a deficiency  or a combination of control deficiencies  in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis 
in addition  we may in the future identify further material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting 
although we have remediated the above material weakness  there can be no assurance that such controls will effectively prevent material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements in future periods 
in addition  we may in the future identify further material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting  which could adversely impact the accuracy and timeliness of our future reporting and reports and filings we make with the sec 
we rely on highly skilled personnel in our businesses  and if we are unable to retain or motivate key personnel or hire qualified personnel  we may not be able to grow effectively 
our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals 
our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify  hire  develop  motivate  and retain skilled personnel for all areas of our organization 
we require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our businesses 
competition for qualified personnel required for our data processing operations and our other segments businesses has intensified in recent years 
our growth has presented challenges to us to recruit  train  and retain our employees while managing the impact of potential wage inflation and the lack of available qualified labor in some markets where we operate 
a well trained  motivated and adequately staffed work force has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business 
our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees 
if we do not effectively manage our transition into new products and services  our revenues may suffer 
products and services for the seismic industry are characterized by rapid technological advances in hardware performance  software functionality and features  frequent introduction of new products and services  and improvement in price characteristics relative to product and service performance 
among the risks 
table of contents associated with the introduction of new products and services are delays in development or manufacturing  variations in costs  delays in customer purchases or reductions in price of existing products in anticipation of new introductions  write offs or write downs of the carrying costs of inventory and raw materials associated with prior generation products  difficulty in predicting customer demand for new product and service offerings and effectively managing inventory levels so that they are in line with anticipated demand  risks associated with customer qualification  evaluation of new products  and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects or may not be supported adequately by application software 
the introduction of new products and services by our competitors also may result in delays in customer purchases and difficulty in predicting customer demand 
if we do not make an effective transition from existing products and services to future offerings  our revenues and margins may decline 
furthermore  sales of our new products and services may replace sales  or result in discounting of some of our current product or service offerings  offsetting the benefit of a successful introduction 
in addition  it may be difficult to ensure performance of new products and services in accordance with our revenue  margin  and cost estimations and to achieve operational efficiencies embedded in our estimates 
given the competitive nature of the seismic industry  if any of these risks materializes  future demand for our products and services  and our future results of operations  may suffer 
technological change in the seismic industry requires us to make substantial research and development expenditures 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by changing technology and new product introductions 
we must invest substantial capital to develop and maintain a leading edge in technology  with no assurance that we will receive an adequate rate of return on those investments 
if we are unable to develop and produce successfully and timely new and enhanced products and services  we will be unable to compete in the future and our business  our results of operations and our financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
the loss of any significant customer could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have traditionally relied on a relatively small number of significant customers 
consequently  our business is exposed to the risks related to customer concentration 
no single customer represented or more of our consolidated net revenues for  and  however  our top five customers in total represented approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated net revenues during those years 
the loss of any of our significant customers or deterioration in our relations with any of them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
historically  a relatively small number of customers has accounted for the majority of our net revenues in any period 
during the last ten years  our traditional seismic contractor customers have been rapidly consolidating  thereby consolidating the demand for our products and services 
the loss of any of our significant customers to further consolidation could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
certain of our facilities could be damaged by hurricanes and other natural disasters  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
certain of our facilities are located in regions of the united states that are susceptible to damage from hurricanes and other weather events  and  during  were impacted by hurricanes or other weather events 
our systems segment leases  square feet of facilities located in harahan  louisiana  in the greater new orleans metropolitan area 
in late august  we suspended operations at these facilities and evacuated and locked down the facilities in preparation for hurricane katrina 
these facilities did not experience flooding or significant damage during or after the hurricane 
however  because of employee evacuations  power failures and lack of related support services  utilities and infrastructure in the new orleans area  we were unable to resume full operations at the facilities until late september in september  we lost power and 
table of contents related services for several days at our offices located in the houston metropolitan area and in harahan  louisiana as a result of hurricane ike and hurricane gustav 
future hurricanes or similar natural disasters that impact our facilities may negatively affect our financial position and operating results for those periods 
these negative effects may include reduced production and product sales  costs associated with resuming production  reduced orders for our products from customers that were similarly affected by these events  lost market share  late deliveries  additional costs to purchase materials and supplies from outside suppliers  uninsured property losses  inadequate business interruption insurance and an inability to retain necessary staff 
to the extent that climate change increases the severity of hurricanes and other weather events  as some have suggested  it could worsen the severity of these negative effects on our financial position and operating results 
climate change regulations or legislation could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas our clients intend to produce 
more stringent regulations and laws relating to climate change and greenhouse gases ghgs may be adopted in the future and could reduce the demand for our products and services 
on december   the us environmental protection agency the epa officially concluded that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide  methane and certain other ghgs present an endangerment to public health and welfare because such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
consistent with its findings  the epa has proposed or adopted various regulations under the clean air act to address ghgs 
among other things  the epa is limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from new cars and light duty trucks beginning with the model year 
when those mobile source standards took effect on january   ghgs became categorized as regulated air pollutants 
this revised status could trigger a variety of other clean air act requirements  including construction and operating permit requirements for industrial plants and other stationary sources 
in response to the fiscal year consolidated appropriations act  the epa also has published a final rule requiring the reporting of ghg emissions from specified large sources in the united states on an annual basis  beginning in for emissions occurring after january  in a final rule published on november   the epa extended those reporting requirements to include onshore oil and natural gas production  processing  transmission  storage  and distribution facilities 
at the same time  the us congress has been considering a variety of new legislative proposals concerning ghgs 
in june  for example  the house of representatives passed the american clean energy and security act of  which  if it had been enacted  would have established an economy wide cap on emissions of ghgs so as to reduce us emissions over time by approximately 
as an alternative  some proponents of ghg controls have advocated mandating a national clean energy standard 
in  president obama encouraged congress to adopt a goal of generating of us electricity from clean energy by with credit for renewable and nuclear power and partial credit for clean coal and efficient natural gas  the president also proposed ending tax breaks for the oil industry 
because of the lack of any comprehensive federal legislative program expressly addressing ghgs  there currently is uncertainty as to how and when additional federal regulation of ghgs might take place and as to whether the epa should continue with its existing regulations in the absence of more specific congressional direction 
a number of states  individually and regionally  have implemented or are considering their own ghg regulatory programs 
these initiatives have included so called cap and trade programs  under which overall ghg emissions are limited and ghg emissions allowances are then allocated and sold  clean energy standards  and other regulatory requirements 
new climate change and related clean energy regulatory initiatives could result in our customers incurring material compliance costs  eg  by being required to purchase or to surrender allowances for ghgs resulting from their operations  or adversely affect the marketability of the oil and natural gas that our customers produce 
the impact of such future programs cannot be predicted  but we do not expect our operations to be affected any differently than other similarly situated domestic competitors 

table of contents increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing could result in reductions or delays in drilling and completing new oil and natural gas wells  which could adversely impact our revenues by decreasing the demand for our seismic acquisition services 
hydraulic fracturing is a process used by oil and gas exploration and production operators in the completion of certain oil and gas wells whereby water  sand and chemicals are injected under pressure into subsurface formations to stimulate gas and  to a lesser extent  oil production 
due to concerns that hydraulic fracturing may adversely affect drinking water supplies  the epa recently announced a plan to conduct a comprehensive research study to investigate any potential adverse impact that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health 
the initial study results are expected to be available in late the us department of the interior also has announced plans to develop a new policy for hydraulic fracturing on public lands that would require the disclosure of chemicals used in the process 
aside from these federal initiatives  several states have moved to require disclosure of fracturing fluid components or otherwise to regulate their use more closely 
in certain areas of the country  new drilling permits for hydraulic fracturing have been put on hold pending development of additional standards 
adoption of legislation or regulations placing restrictions on hydraulic fracturing activities could impose operational delays  increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens on exploration and production operators  which could reduce their production of natural gas and  in turn  adversely affect our revenues and results of operations by decreasing the demand for our seismic data acquisition services 
we have outsourcing arrangements with third parties to manufacture some of our products 
if these third party suppliers fail to deliver quality products or components at reasonable prices on a timely basis  we may alienate some of our customers and our revenues  profitability  and cash flow may decline 
additionally  current global economic conditions could have a negative impact on our suppliers  causing a disruption in our vendor supplies 
a disruption in vendor supplies may adversely affect our results of operations 
our manufacturing processes require a high volume of quality components 
we have increased our use of contract manufacturers as an alternative to our own manufacturing of products 
we have outsourced the manufacturing of our towed marine streamers  our redeployable ocean bottom cables  our mems components  and various components of vectorseis ocean 
certain components used by us are currently provided by only one supplier 
if  in implementing any outsource initiative  we are unable to identify contract manufacturers willing to contract with us on competitive terms and to devote adequate resources to fulfill their obligations to us or if we do not properly manage these relationships  our existing customer relationships may suffer 
in addition  by undertaking these activities  we run the risk that the reputation and competitiveness of our products and services may deteriorate as a result of the reduction of our control over quality and delivery schedules 
we also may experience supply interruptions  cost escalations  and competitive disadvantages if our contract manufacturers fail to develop  implement  or maintain manufacturing methods appropriate for our products and customers 
reliance on certain suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involves several risks  including the possibility of a shortage or a lack of availability of key components  increases in component costs and reduced control over delivery schedules 
if any of these risks are realized  our revenues  profitability  and cash flows may decline 
in addition  as we come to rely more heavily on contract manufacturers  we may have fewer personnel resources with expertise to manage problems that may arise from these third party arrangements 
additionally  our suppliers could be negatively impacted by current global economic conditions 
if certain of our suppliers were to experience significant cash flow issues or become insolvent as a result of such conditions  it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies to us or a significant increase in the price of such supplies and adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows 
under some of our outsourcing arrangements  our manufacturing outsourcers purchase agreed upon inventory levels to meet our forecasted demand 
our manufacturing plans and inventory levels are generally based on sales forecasts 
if demand proves to be less than we originally forecasted and we cancel our 
table of contents committed purchase orders  our outsourcers generally will have the right to require us to purchase inventory which they had purchased on our behalf 
should we be required to purchase inventory under these terms  we may be required to hold inventory that we may never utilize 
our operations  and the operations of our customers  are subject to numerous government regulations  which could adversely limit our operating flexibility 
our operations are subject to laws  regulations  government policies  and product certification requirements worldwide 
changes in such laws  regulations  policies or requirements could affect the demand for our products or result in the need to modify products  which may involve substantial costs or delays in sales and could have an adverse effect on our future operating results 
our export activities are also subject to extensive and evolving trade regulations 
certain countries are subject to restrictions  sanctions  and embargoes imposed by the united states government 
these restrictions  sanctions  and embargoes also prohibit or limit us from participating in certain business activities in those countries 
our operations are subject to numerous local  state  and federal laws and regulations in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials  the remediation of contaminated properties  and the protection of the environment 
these laws have been changed frequently in the past  and there can be no assurance that future changes will not have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  our customers operations are also significantly impacted by laws and regulations concerning the protection of the environment and endangered species 
consequently  changes in governmental regulations applicable to our customers may reduce demand for our products and services 
to the extent that our customers operations are disrupted by future laws and regulations  our business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  delaware law  our stockholders rights plan  the terms of our series d preferred stock and contractual requirements under our agreements with fletcher and bgp contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  delaware law  our stockholders rights plan  the terms of our series d preferred stock  our agreement with fletcher and our investor rights agreement with bgp may discourage  delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable  including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for shares of our common stock

item legal proceedings westerngeco on june   westerngeco llc westerngeco filed a lawsuit against us in the united states district court for the southern district of texas  houston division 
in the lawsuit  styled westerngeco llc v 
ion geophysical corporation  westerngeco alleges that we have infringed several united states patents regarding marine seismic streamer steering devices that are owned by westerngeco 
westerngeco is seeking unspecified monetary damages and an injunction prohibiting us from making  using  selling  offering for sale or supplying any infringing products in the united states 
based on our review of the lawsuit filed by westerngeco and the westerngeco patents at issue  we believe that our products do not infringe any westerngeco patents  that the claims asserted against us by westerngeco are without merit and that the 
table of contents ultimate outcome of the claims will not result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we intend to defend the claims against us vigorously 
on june   we filed an answer and counterclaims against westerngeco  in which we deny that we have infringed westerngeco s patents and assert that the westerngeco patents are invalid or unenforceable 
we also asserted that westerngeco s q marine system  components and technology infringe upon our united states patent related to marine seismic streamer steering devices 
we also assert that westerngeco tortiously interfered with our relationship with our customers 
in addition  we are claiming that the lawsuit by westerngeco is an illegal attempt by westerngeco to control and restrict competition in the market for marine seismic surveys performed using laterally steerable streamers 
we are requesting various remedies and relief  including a declaration that the westerngeco patents are invalid or unenforceable  an injunction prohibiting westerngeco from making  using  selling  offering for sale or supplying any infringing products in the united states  a declaration that the westerngeco patents should be co owned by us  and an award of unspecified monetary damages 
in june  westerngeco filed a lawsuit against various subsidiaries and affiliates of fugro nv fugro  a seismic contractor customer of the company  accusing the defendants of infringing the same united states patents regarding marine seismic streamer steering devices by planning to use certain equipment purchased from us on a survey located outside of us territorial waters 
the court approved the consolidation of the fugro case with our case 
the defendants in the fugro case have filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit 
fletcher we are or have been involved in two lawsuits filed in delaware involving fletcher international  ltd 
fletcher  the holder of shares of our series d preferred stock 
under our february agreement with fletcher  the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued or issuable to fletcher upon conversion of the series d preferred stock could not exceed a designated maximum number of shares the maximum number  and such maximum number could be increased by fletcher providing us with a day notice of increase 
in november  fletcher exercised its right to increase the maximum number from  shares to  shares 
on september   fletcher delivered a second notice to us  intending to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our series d preferred stock from  shares to  shares 
our interpretation of the agreement with fletcher was that fletcher had the right to issue only one notice to increase the maximum number which fletcher had exercised in november 
on november   we filed an action in the court of chancery of the state of delaware  styled ion geophysical corporation v 
fletcher international  ltd  seeking a declaration that  under the agreement  fletcher was permitted to deliver only one notice to increase the maximum number and that its second notice was legally invalid 
fletcher filed an answer and counterclaim  seeking specific performance and reimbursement and indemnification for its costs and expenses that it claimed it was entitled to under the agreement 
on november   the court of chancery issued its opinion in the matter  and held that fletcher was entitled to deliver multiple notices to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock but not beyond a total of  shares 
the court also ruled that we are not required to indemnify fletcher for its fees  costs and expenses incurred in connection with the proceedings 
on november   fletcher sent us a notice to increase the maximum number of shares to  shares  effective january  currently  fletcher s remaining outstanding shares of series d preferred stock are convertible into up to  shares of our common stock 
on november   fletcher filed a lawsuit against us and certain of our directors in the delaware court of chancery

vlahakis  fletcher alleged  among other things  that we violated fletcher s consent rights contained in the series d preferred stock certificates of designation  by having ion s rl  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of ion geophysical corporation  issuing a convertible promissory note to the bank of china in connection with the bank of china bridge loan funded on october   and that the directors violated their fiduciary 
table of contents duty to the company by allowing ion s rl to issue the convertible note without fletcher s consent 
fletcher sought a court order requiring ion s rl to repay the million advanced to ion s rl under the bridge loan and unspecified monetary damages 
on march   the presiding judge in the case denied fletcher s request for the court order 
in a memorandum opinion issued on may  in response to a motion for partial summary judgment  the judge dismissed all of fletcher s claims against our named directors but also concluded that  because the bridge loan note issued by ion s rl was convertible into ion common stock  fletcher had the right to consent to the issuance of the note and that we violated fletcher s consent right by ion s rl issuing the note without fletcher s consent 
in december  the presiding judge in the case recused himself from the case without explanation and a new presiding judge was appointed to the case 
the holder of the convertible note issued by ion s rl never exercised its right to convert the note  and the note was paid in full in march we believe that the remaining claims asserted by fletcher in the lawsuit are without merit 
we further believe that the monetary damages suffered by fletcher as a result of ion s rl issuing the bridge loan note without fletcher s consent are nonexistent or nominal  and that the ultimate outcome of the lawsuit will not result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we intend to defend the remaining claims against us in this lawsuit vigorously 
greatbatch in  we filed a lawsuit against operating subsidiaries of battery manufacturer greatbatch  inc  including its electrochem division collectively greatbatch  in the th judicial district court for the parish of jefferson in the state of louisiana 
in the lawsuit  styled input output  inc and i o marine systems  inc 
v 
wilson greatbatch technologies  inc  wilson greatbatch  ltd 
d b a electrochem lithium batteries  and wgl intermediate holdings  inc  civil action no 
 division a  we alleged that greatbatch had fraudulently misappropriated our product designs and other trade secrets related to the batteries and battery pack used in our digibird marine towed streamer vertical control device and used our confidential information to manufacture and market competing batteries and battery packs 
after a trial  on october  the jury concluded that greatbatch had committed fraud  violated the louisiana unfair trade practices act and breached a trust and nondisclosure agreement between us and greatbatch  and awarded us million in compensatory damages 
a judgment was entered consistent with the jury verdict 
in december  we and greatbatch settled the lawsuit  pursuant to which greatbatch paid us million in full satisfaction of the judgment 
upon the cash receipt  we recorded a gain on legal settlement of million  net of fees paid to attorneys 
sercel on january   the jury in a patent infringement lawsuit filed by us against seismic equipment provider sercel  inc in the united states district court for the eastern district of texas returned a verdict in our favor 
in the lawsuit  styled input output  inc et al v 
sercel  inc  cv  we alleged that sercel s  and searay digital seismic sensor units infringe our united states patent no 
 which is incorporated in our vectorseis sensor technology 
products that use our vectorseis technology include the system four  scorpion  firefly  and vectorseis ocean seismic acquisition systems 
after a two week trial  the jury concluded that sercel infringed our patent and that our patent was valid  and the jury awarded us million in compensatory past damages 
in response to post verdict motions made the parties  on september  the presiding judge issued a series of rulings that a granted our motion for a permanent injunction to be issued prohibiting the manufacture  use or sale of the infringing sercel products  b confirmed that our patent was valid  c confirmed that the jury s finding of infringement was supported by the evidence and d disallowed million of lost profits that were based on infringing products that were manufactured and delivered by sercel outside of the us  but were offered for sale by sercel in the us and involved underlying orders and payments received by sercel in the us in addition  the judge concluded that the evidence supporting the jury s finding that we are entitled to be awarded million in lost profits associated with certain infringing pre verdict marine sales by sercel was too speculative and therefore disallowed that award of lost profits 
as a result of the judge s ruling  we are now entitled to be awarded an additional amount of damages equal to a reasonable royalty on the infringing pre verdict sercel marine sales 
after learning that sercel continued to make sales of infringing products after the january jury verdict was rendered  we 
table of contents filed motions with the court to seek additional compensatory damages for the post verdict infringing sales and enhanced damages as a result of the willful nature of sercel s post verdict infringement 
on february   the court entered a final judgment and permanent injunction in the case 
the final judgment awarded us million in damages  plus interest  and the permanent injunction prohibits sercel and parties acting in concert with sercel from making  using  offering to sell  selling  or importing in the united states which includes territorial waters of the united states sercel s ul  xl and searay digital sensor units  and all other products that are only colorably different from those products 
the court ordered that the additional damages to be paid by sercel as a reasonable royalty on the infringing pre verdict sercel marine sales and the additional damages to be paid by sercel resulting from post verdict infringing sales be determined in a separate future proceeding 
we have not recorded any amounts related to this gain contingency as of december  other we have been named in various other lawsuits or threatened actions that are incidental to our ordinary business 
litigation is inherently unpredictable 
any claims against us  whether meritorious or not  could be time consuming  cause us to incur costs and expenses  require significant amounts of management time and result in the diversion of significant operational resources 
the results of these lawsuits and actions cannot be predicted with certainty

executive summary our business we are a leading provider of geophysical technology  services  and solutions for the global oil and gas industry  offering advanced acquisition equipment  software and planning and seismic processing services to the global energy industry 
our product and service offerings allow exploration and production e p operators to obtain higher resolution images of the subsurface to reduce the risk of exploration and reservoir development  and to enable seismic contractors to acquire geophysical data more efficiently 
we serve customers in all major energy producing regions of the world from strategically located offices in cities on five continents 
in march  we contributed most of our land seismic equipment business to a joint venture we formed with bgp inc  china national petroleum corporation bgp  a wholly owned oil field service subsidiary of china national petroleum corporation cnpc 
the resulting joint venture company  organized under the laws of the people s republic of china  is named inova geophysical equipment limited inova geophysical 
we believe that this joint venture will provide us the opportunity to further extend the geographic scope of our business through the sales and service facilities of bgp  especially in africa  the middle east  china and southeast asia 
our products and services include the following land seismic data acquisition equipment principally through our ownership in inova geophysical  marine seismic data acquisition equipment  navigation  command control and data management software products  planning services for survey design and optimization  seismic data processing and reservoir imaging services  and seismic data libraries 

table of contents we operate our company through four business segments systems  software  solutions and our inova geophysical joint venture 
systems towed streamer and redeployable ocean bottom cable seismic data acquisition systems and shipboard recorders  streamer positioning and control systems and energy sources such as air guns and air gun controllers and analog geophone sensors 
software software systems and related services for navigation and data management involving towed marine streamer and seabed operations 
solutions advanced seismic data processing services for marine and land environments  seismic data libraries  and integrated seismic solutions iss services 
inova geophysical cable based  cableless and radio controlled seismic data acquisition systems  digital sensors  vibroseis vehicles ie vibrator trucks and source controllers for detonator and energy sources business lines 
economic conditions demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry  particularly our customers willingness and ability to expend their capital for oil and natural gas exploration and development projects 
this demand is highly sensitive to current and expected future oil and natural gas prices 
the volatility of oil and natural gas prices in recent years had resulted in sharply curtailed demand for oil and gas exploration activities in north america and other regions 
oil prices increased to record levels during the second quarter of  but  in conjunction with the global recession  sharply declined  falling to approximately per barrel during early since then  crude oil prices have recovered to within a range of approximately to per barrel by early natural gas prices followed a similar  recession induced downturn 
after peaking at mmbtu in july  henry hub natural gas prices fell by more than 
unlike the recovery in oil prices  us natural gas prices have remained depressed due to the excess supply of natural gas in the north american market 
our seismic contractor customers and the e p companies that are users of our products  services and technology generally reduced their capital spending levels in and additionally  with the overall market decline  the market focus shifted from the acquisition of new seismic data to utilizing and reprocessing previously acquired seismic data 
however  we saw increased levels of capital spending related to e p activity during the second half of the number of rigs drilling for oil in north america is approaching record levels with us rig counts increasing by approximately year over year 
over the past decade  a majority of all new oil and gas reserves discovered worldwide were located offshore and we believe that offshore e p activity will continue to grow in an effort to meet global energy demands 
meanwhile  interest in oil shale opportunities is increasing and developments in the technology to locate and extract oil shale reserves are progressing 
almost of new us onshore natural gas production is now coming from the shale gas plays which exhibit first year decline rates of to 
we expect that exploration and production expenditures will continue to recover to the extent e p companies and seismic contractors continue to see recovery in activity levels related to their business 
the land seismic equipment business  particularly inova geophysical s business in north america and russia  continues to experience softness 
however  our other businesses delivered positive results in  particularly in the third and fourth quarters  and we anticipate that this improvement will continue into during the fourth quarter  we experienced a significant increase in sales from our data libraries from a diverse range of geographic regions  including east and west africa  brazil and the arctic regions  primarily due to increased capital expenditures by our e p customers 
new venture revenues also improved year over year  primarily related to the completion of the acquisition phase of our projects in the arctic region during our third quarter 
our data processing and software businesses with the software business revenues expressed in terms of its local currency  british pounds sterling generated record levels of revenues in and again in also  the marine side of our systems business delivered revenues consistent with the prior year primarily due to sales of towed streamer products to bgp and other customers 

table of contents we are seeing improvements in demand and believe that our industry s long term prospects remain favorable because of the decreasing number of new discoveries of significant oil and gas reserves 
we believe that technologies that add a competitive advantage through cost reductions or improvements in productivity will continue to be valued in our marketplace 
we expect that our new technologies such as digifin tm and orca  and inova geophysical s firefly will continue to attract interest from our customers because those technologies are designed to deliver improvements in image quality within more productive delivery systems 
in october  the minerals management service now known as the bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement  or boemre of the us department of the interior announced the end of the six month moratorium on certain drilling activities in the us gulf of mexico 
the six month moratorium was the result of the deepwater horizon drilling rig explosion and fire in april  which resulted in the release of millions of gallons of hydrocarbons into the gulf of mexico 
the boemre has issued new safety and environmental guidelines and regulations for offshore operations  is expected to issue new safety or environmental guidelines or regulations for offshore drilling  and may take further steps that could increase the costs of exploration and production or reduce the area of operations and result in permitting delays 
the permitting process for exploration and development activities in the us gulf of mexico has slowed considerably  resulting in very limited levels of activity there 
these new safety and environmental regulations will expose our customers  and could expose us  to significant additional costs and liabilities 
although it is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of the slowdown in exploration and development activities in the us gulf of mexico or the new safety and environmental guidelines and regulations  a prolonged suspension of drilling activity in the gulf of mexico and other areas and increased liability for companies operating in this sector could adversely affect many of our customers who operate in the gulf of mexico 
this could  in turn  adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition  particularly regarding sales of our marine seismic equipment and solutions seismic survey and data processing activities covering locations in the gulf of mexico 
while seismic data processing activity in our solutions segment has continued to remain strong during  we cannot currently predict whether these events will adversely affect our future data processing services business  and if so  the extent and length of time that any such adverse impact will be felt

table of contents we intend that the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations will provide information that will assist in understanding our consolidated financial statements  the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year  and the primary factors that accounted for those changes 
our results of operations for have been materially affected by the disposition of our land businesses in forming inova geophysical on march   which affects the comparability of certain of the financial information contained in this form k 
in order to assist with the comparability to our historical results of operations  certain of the financial tables and discussion below exclude the results of operations of our disposed legacy land equipment segment which we refer to below as our legacy land systems segment

table of contents softness in land seismic activity 
gross profit for decreased by million to million  representing a gross margin  compared to million  representing a gross margin  for the increase in gross margins in our systems segment was primarily due to changes in product mix  with greater sales of marine towed streamer products  which have generally experienced higher margins compared to our other systems products 
software net revenues for increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for the increase was primarily due to the continued increased demand for our orca software systems products 
the increase in us dollars was partially offset by the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
expressed in british pounds sterling the local currency  net revenues increased by million  or 
gross profit increased by million to million compared to million for  while gross margins of remained fairly consistent with prior year margins 
solutions net revenues for increased by million  to million  compared to million for this increase was primarily due to greater seismic data library sales  particularly during the fourth quarter of  driven by higher capital expenditures from our e p customers 
this increase in data library sales was from many regions across the world  including east and west africa  brazil and the arctic 
our data processing services group delivered record revenues in while new venture revenues increased primarily due to successful completion of data acquisition for our arctic programs in the third quarter

marketing and sales marketing and sales expense of million  as adjusted  or of net revenues  for decreased million compared to million  as adjusted  or of net revenues  for the corresponding period of even though our revenues  as adjusted  increased  our marketing and sales expenses remained flat compared to the prior year due in part to our previously implemented cost reduction measures from general and administrative general and administrative expenses of million  as adjusted  for decreased million compared to million  as adjusted  for the corresponding period of general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues for and were and  respectively 
a portion of this decrease in general and administrative expense was due to a million stock based compensation expense with respect to an out of period item recorded in  related to adjustments resulting from certain differences between estimated and actual forfeitures of stock based compensation awards 
the remainder of the decrease was due to lower salary and payroll expenses related to our reduced headcount and by lower bad debt expense compared to the prior year 
non operating items interest expense  net interest expense  net  of million for decreased million compared to million for our interest expense in included the accretion of approximately million of non cash debt discount fully amortized in the first quarter of associated with two convertible promissory notes payable to bank of china  new york branch  that we had executed in october and a write off of million of deferred financing charges related to our debt refinancing transactions during the first quarter of after excluding these two non cash items  our interest expense  net  was

equity in losses of inova geophysical we account for our interest in inova geophysical as an equity method investment and record our share of earnings of inova geophysical on a one fiscal quarter lag basis 
thus  our share of inova geophysical s loss for the period from march  to september  is included in our financial results for for  we recorded approximately million representing our share of equity in losses of inova geophysical 
included in the million is million that represents our share of a write down of excess inventory by inova geophysical 
the land operations business continues to be significantly impacted by the economic slow down  particularly in north america and russia 
these businesses are starting to see an increase in interest and tender activities by its customers  but we do not expect this increase in activity to have any significant impact on inova geophysical s results of operations in gain on legal settlement in  we recorded a gain related to cash received from our legal settlement with greatbatch  inc for additional information  please refer to note legal matters

during  we recorded income from operations of million  compared to a loss of million  as adjusted  during net revenues  gross profits and gross margins excluding legacy land systems systems net revenues for decreased by million to million  compared to million for this decrease was seen across most of our systems product lines  most notably in our marine streamer positioning products  our land geophone products and our vectorseis ocean vso ocean bottom system product line 
the decline in our marine streamer positioning products was due to the delays in the scheduled completion and commissioning of new marine vessels to be introduced into the market  which would otherwise have been outfitted with our marine products 
the decrease in our land geophone products was due to lower sales volumes resulting from the continued land seismic market decline  which greatly impacted our geophone business 
the decrease in our vso revenues was due to deliveries in of vso system and system  which were not duplicated in this decrease was partially offset by increased sales of our digifin streamer control systems  compared to levels 
gross profit decreased by million to million  representing a gross margin  compared to million  representing a gross margin  during the increase in gross margins in our systems segment was mainly due to changes in the 
table of contents product mix  principally attributable to a decrease of million in vso revenues in compared to sales of our vso systems have generally experienced lower margins compared to our other marine products 
software net revenues for decreased by million to million  compared to million for the decrease was due entirely to the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations

gross profit decreased by million to million compared to million during  while gross margins of remained fairly consistent with prior year margins 
solutions net revenues for decreased by million  to million  compared to million for the results for reflected decreases in sales from our seismic data library  most notably in the offshore africa and india regions  and decreased revenues from new multi client seismic surveys 
these decreases were due to decreased spending by our customers as a result of reduced demand caused by the global recession 
with the overall market decline  the market focus shifted from the acquisition of new seismic data to utilizing and reprocessing previously acquired seismic data 
this shift was evidenced by the decreases in our seismic data library sales and revenues from new multi client seismic surveys  however  these decreases were partially offset by increases in data processing revenues 
gross profit decreased by million to million  representing a gross margin  compared to million  representing a gross margin  during the increase in gross margins for our solutions segment was mainly driven by the increased revenues from our higher margin data processing services compared to revenues from these services for the prior year 
this increase was partially offset by lower gross margins in our multi client data library sales  which were due to the impact of the straight line multi client data library amortization rates  combined with lower revenues from sales from that data library 
operating expenses excluding legacy land systems research  development and engineering research  development and engineering expense was million  as adjusted  or of net revenues  for  a decrease of million compared to million  as adjusted  or of net revenues  for this decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to decreased salary and payroll expenses related to our reduced headcount  partially offset by increased professional fees relating to current projects

table of contents non operating items interest expense  net interest expense  net  of million for increased million compared to million for the corresponding period the increase was due to the higher levels of outstanding indebtedness and the secured equipment financing transaction that occurred during the second and third quarters of combined with increased revolver borrowings of million and higher prevailing average interest rates in compared to also  during  we amortized to interest expense million of a non cash debt discount associated with the convertible notes issued to bank of china in october fair value adjustment of warrant we were required to account for separately and adjust to fair value the warrant we issued to bgp in october during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a negative non cash fair value adjustment of million  reflecting the increase in fair value of the warrant from its issuance through december  for additional information  please refer to note formation of inova geophysical and related financing transactions 
impairment of cost method investment at december   we evaluated our cost method investments for potential impairments 
based upon our evaluation and given the current market conditions related to our investment in colibrys  ltd  we determined that the investment was fully impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million 
other income expense other expense for was million compared to other income of million for the other expense for mainly relates to higher foreign currency exchange losses that primarily resulted from our operations in the united kingdom and canada 
income tax benefit expense income tax benefit for was million compared to million of tax expense for the increase in tax benefits during primarily relates to reduced consolidated income from operations 
we continued to maintain a valuation allowance for a significant portion of our us net deferred tax assets 
our effective tax rate for was as compared to for the similar period during the increase in our effective tax rate related primarily to the impairment of goodwill  which has no tax benefit 
preferred stock dividends the preferred stock dividend relates to our series d preferred stock 
quarterly dividends must be paid in cash 
dividends are paid at a rate equal to the greater of i per annum or ii the three month libor rate on the last day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter plus per annum 
the series d preferred stock dividend rate was at december  liquidity and capital resources sources of capital our cash requirements include our working capital requirements  and cash required for our debt service payments  dividend payments on our preferred stock  seismic data acquisitions and capital expenditures 
as of december   we had working capital of million  which included million of cash on hand 
working capital requirements are primarily driven by our continued investment in our multi client seismic data library million in fiscal and  to a lesser extent  our inventory purchase obligations 
at december   our outstanding inventory purchase obligations were million 
also  our headcount has traditionally been a significant driver of our working capital needs 
because a significant portion of our business is involved in the planning  processing and interpretation of seismic data services  one of our largest investments is in our employees  which involves cash expenditures for their salaries  bonuses  payroll taxes and related compensation expenses 
our working capital requirements may change from time to time depending upon many factors  including our operating results and adjustments in our operating plan required in response to industry conditions  competition  acquisition opportunities and unexpected events 
in recent years  our primary sources of funds have been cash flows generated from our operations  our existing cash balances  debt and equity issuances and borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan facilities see revolving line of credit and term loan facility below

the credit facility replaces our previous syndicated credit facility under an amended and restated credit agreement dated as of july   as it had been subsequently amended numerous times the prior facility 
the terms and conditions of the credit facility are similar in many respects to the terms and conditions under the prior facility 
the credit facility provides us with a revolving line of credit of up to million in borrowings including borrowings for letters of credit  and refinanced our outstanding term loan under the prior facility with a new term loan in the original principal amount of million 
the credit facility  like the prior facility  permits direct borrowings by ion s rl for use by our foreign subsidiaries 
under the credit facility  up to million is available for revolving line of credit borrowings by us  and up to million or its equivalent in foreign currencies is available for revolving line of credit borrowings by ion s rl  but the total amounts borrowed may not exceed million 
borrowings under the credit facility are not subject to a borrowing base 
as of december   and february   we had no indebtedness outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
revolving credit borrowings under the credit facility may be utilized to fund the working capital needs of ion and our subsidiaries  to finance acquisitions and investments and for general corporate purposes 
in addition  the credit facility includes a million sub limit for the issuance of documentary and stand by letters of credit 
the revolving credit indebtedness and term loan indebtedness under the credit facility are each scheduled to mature on march  the million original principal amount under the term loan is subject to scheduled quarterly amortization payments of million per quarter until the maturity date  with the remaining unpaid principal amount of the term loan due upon the maturity date

as of december   the million in outstanding term loan indebtedness under the credit facility accrues interest at a rate of rate per annum 
the parties had originally contemplated that inova geophysical would be an additional guarantor or provider of credit support under the credit agreement 
however  due to the time required to obtain necessary 
table of contents chinese governmental approvals for such credit support from inova geophysical  the credit agreement instead required bgp to enter into an agreement to guarantee the indebtedness under the credit facility  which inova geophysical s guarantee would replace when the applicable governmental approvals were obtained 
we entered into a credit support agreement with bgp whereby ion agreed to indemnify bgp for losses sustained by bgp that arose out of or were a result of the enforcement of bgp s guarantee 
in june  the applicable governmental approvals were obtained and bgp was then released from its guarantee obligations and these obligations were assumed by inova geophysical as originally contemplated under the credit agreement 
in addition  ion s credit support agreement with bgp was terminated

upon commencement of the financial covenants on june   we expect to be in compliance and remain in compliance throughout the remainder of the credit agreement contains customary event of default provisions similar to those contained in the credit agreement for the prior facility including a change of control event affecting us  the occurrence of which could lead to an acceleration of ion s obligations under the credit facility 
the credit agreement also provides that certain acts of bankruptcy  insolvency or liquidation of inova geophysical or bgp would constitute additional events of default under the credit facility 
interest rate caps we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to the interest rate risks related to the variable rate debt under our term loan indebtedness 
we do not use derivatives for trading 
table of contents or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
in august of  we entered into an interest rate cap agreement and purchased interest rate caps having an initial notional amount of million with a three month average libor cap of 
if and when the three month average libor rate exceeds  the libor portion of interest owed by us would be effectively capped at 
this initial notional amount was set to equal the projected outstanding balance under our term loan facility at december  the notional amount was then set so as not to exceed the outstanding balance of our term loan facility over the period through march  we purchased these interest rate caps for an amount equal to approximately million 
we designated the interest rate caps as cash flow hedges 
see further discussion regarding these interest rate caps at note notes payable  long term debt  lease obligations and interest rate caps 
cumulative convertible preferred stock during  we entered into an agreement dated february  with fletcher this agreement  as amended to the date hereof  is referred to as the fletcher agreement and issued to fletcher  shares of our series d preferred stock in a privately negotiated transaction  receiving million in net proceeds 
the fletcher agreement also provided to fletcher an option to purchase up to an additional  shares of additional series of preferred stock from time to time  with each series having a conversion price that would be equal to of an average daily volume weighted market price of our common stock over a trailing period of days at the time of issuance of that series 
in and  fletcher exercised this option and purchased  shares of series d preferred stock for million in december and the remaining  shares of series d preferred stock for million in february 
fletcher remains the sole holder of all of our outstanding shares of series d preferred stock 
dividends on the shares of series d preferred stock must be paid in cash 
under the fletcher agreement  if a day volume weighted average trading price per share of our common stock fell below the minimum price  we were required to deliver a notice the reset notice to fletcher 
on november   the day volume weighted average trading price per share of our common stock on the new york stock exchange for the previous trading days was calculated to be  and we delivered the reset notice to fletcher in accordance with the terms of the fletcher agreement 
in the reset notice  we elected to reset the conversion prices for the series d preferred stock to the minimum price per share  and fletcher s redemption rights were terminated 
the adjusted conversion price resulting from this election was effective on november  in addition  under the fletcher agreement  the aggregate number of shares of common stock issued or issuable to fletcher upon conversion or redemption of  or as dividends paid on  the series d preferred stock could not exceed a designated maximum number of shares the maximum number  and such maximum number could be increased by fletcher providing us with a day notice of increase  but under no circumstance could the total number of shares of common stock issued or issuable to fletcher with respect to the series d preferred stock ever exceed  shares 
the fletcher agreement had designated  shares as the original maximum number 
in november  fletcher delivered a notice to us to increase the maximum number to  shares  effective february  on september   fletcher delivered a second notice to us  intending to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of our series d preferred stock from  shares to  shares  to become effective on november  our interpretation of the agreement with fletcher was that fletcher had the right to issue only one notice to increase the maximum number which right fletcher had exercised in november 
on november   we filed an action in the court of chancery of the state of delaware seeking a declaration that  under the fletcher agreement  fletcher is permitted to deliver only one notice to increase the maximum number and that its second notice is legally invalid 
on november   the court of chancery issued its opinion in the matter  and held that fletcher was entitled to deliver multiple notices to increase the maximum number of shares of common stock but not beyond a total of  shares 
on november   fletcher delivered a notice to us to increase the maximum number to the full  shares  effective january  
table of contents on april   fletcher converted  of its shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock  and all of the outstanding  shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock  into a total of  shares of our common stock 
fletcher continues to own  shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock and  shares of series d cumulative convertible preferred stock 
as a result of the above ruling by the court of chancery  under the terms of the fletcher agreement  fletcher s remaining  shares of series d preferred stock are convertible into a total of up to  shares of our common stock 
the conversion prices and number of shares of common stock to be acquired upon conversion are also subject to customary anti dilution adjustments 
converting the shares of series d preferred stock at one time could result in significant dilution to our stockholders that could limit our ability to raise additional capital 
certain rights and obligations of fletcher and our company pertaining to the series d preferred stock are currently the subject of pending litigation in the chancery court of the state of delaware

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make choices between acceptable methods of accounting and to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies are based on  among other things  judgments and assumptions made by management that include inherent risk and uncertainties 
management s estimates are based on the relevant information available at the end of each period 
we believe that all of the judgments and estimates used to prepare our financial statements were reasonable at the time we made them  but circumstances may change requiring us to revise our estimates in ways that could be materially adverse to our results of operations and financial condition 
management has discussed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to the estimates in this management s discussion and analysis 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from the sale of i acquisition systems and other seismic equipment within our systems segment  ii multi client surveys  licenses of off the shelf data libraries and imaging services  within our solutions segment  and iii navigation  survey and quality control software systems within our software segment 
acquisition systems and other seismic equipment for the sales of acquisition systems and other seismic equipment  we follow the requirements of asc revenue recognition and recognize revenue when a evidence of an arrangement exists  b the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d the acquisition system or other seismic equipment is delivered 
table of contents to the customer and risk of ownership has passed to the customer  or  in the limited case where a substantive customer specified acceptance clause exists in the contract  the later of delivery or when the customer specified acceptance is obtained 
multi client surveys  data libraries and imaging services revenues from multi client surveys are recognized as the seismic data is acquired and or processed on a proportionate basis as work is performed 
under this method  we recognize revenues based upon quantifiable measures of progress  such as kilometers acquired or days processed 
upon completion of a multi client seismic survey  the survey data is considered off the shelf and licenses to the survey data are sold to customers on a non exclusive basis 
the license of a completed multi client survey is represented by the license of one standard set of data 
revenues on licenses of completed multi client data surveys are recognized when a a signed final master geophysical data license agreement and accompanying supplemental license agreement are returned by the customer  b the purchase price for the license is fixed or determinable  c delivery or performance has occurred  and d no significant uncertainty exists as to the customer s obligation  willingness or ability to pay 
in limited situations  we have provided the customer with a right to exchange seismic data for another specific seismic data set 
in these limited situations  we recognize revenue at the earlier of the customer exercising its exchange right or the expiration of the customer s exchange right 
revenues from all imaging and other services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenues from contract services performed on a day rate basis are recognized as the service is performed 
software for the sales of navigation  survey and quality control software systems  we follow the requirements for these transactions of asc software revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from sales of these software systems when a evidence of an arrangement exists  b the price to the customer is fixed and determinable  c collectibility is reasonably assured  and d the software is delivered to the customer and risk of ownership has passed to the customer  or  in the limited case where a substantive customer specified acceptance clause exists  the later of delivery or when the customer specified acceptance is obtained 
these arrangements generally include us providing related services  such as training courses  engineering services and annual software maintenance 
we allocate revenue to each element of the arrangement based upon vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the element or  if vsoe is not available for the delivered element  we apply the residual method 
in addition to perpetual software licenses  we offer certain time based software licenses 
for time based licenses  we recognize revenue ratably over the contract term  which is generally two to five years 
multi element arrangements when separate elements such as an acquisition system  other seismic equipment and or imaging services are contained in a single sales arrangement  or in related arrangements with the same customer  we follow the requirements of asc accounting for multiple element revenue arrangement asc 
the multiple element arrangements guidance codified in asc was modified as a result of the final consensus reached in accounting standards update asu  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we adopted this new guidance as of january  accordingly  we applied this guidance to transactions initiated or materially modified on or after january  the new guidance does not apply to software sales accounted for under asc there was no material impact of adopting this guidance to our results for this guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of an arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method 
per the provisions of this guidance  we allocate arrangement consideration to each deliverable qualifying as a separate unit of accounting in an arrangement based on its relative selling price 
we determine selling price using vsoe  if it exists  and otherwise third party evidence tpe 
if neither vsoe nor tpe of selling price exists for a unit of accounting  we use estimated selling price esp 
we generally expect that we will not be able to establish tpe due to the nature of the markets in which we compete  and  as such  we typically will determine selling price using vsoe or if not available  esp 
vsoe is generally limited to the price charged when the same or similar product is sold on a standalone 
table of contents basis 
if a product is seldom sold on a standalone basis  it is unlikely that we can determine vsoe for the product 
the objective of esp is to determine the price at which we would transact if the product were sold by us on a standalone basis 
our determination of esp involves a weighting of several factors based on the specific facts and circumstances of the arrangement 
specifically  we will consider the anticipated margin on the particular deliverable  the selling price and profit margin for similar products and our ongoing pricing strategy and policies 
we believe this new guidance will principally impact our systems division in which a typical arrangement might involve the sale of various products of our acquisition systems and other seismic equipment 
products under these arrangements are often delivered to the customer within the same period  but in certain situations  depending upon product availability and the customer s delivery requirements  the products could be delivered to the customer at different times 
in these situations  we consider our products to be separate units of accounting provided the delivered product has value to the customer on a standalone basis 
we consider a deliverable to have standalone value if the product is sold separately by us or another vendor or could be resold by the customer 
further  our revenue arrangements generally do not include a general right of return relative to the delivered products 
in addition  pursuant to the transitional requirements of the new multiple element revenue guidance  we adopted the guidance codified by asu  certain arrangements that include software elements  as of january  this guidance amends the accounting model for revenue arrangements that includes both tangible products and software elements  such that tangible products containing both software and non software components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality are no longer within the scope of software revenue guidance 
there was not a material impact to our financial statements of adopting this guidance 
multi client data library our multi client data library consists of seismic surveys that are offered for licensing to customers on a non exclusive basis 
the capitalized costs include the costs paid to third parties for the acquisition of data and related activities associated with the data creation activity and direct internal processing costs  such as salaries  benefits  computer related expenses  and other costs incurred for seismic data project design and management 
for  and  we capitalized  as part of our multi client data library  million  million  and million  respectively  of direct internal processing costs 
our method of amortizing the costs of an in process multi client data library the period during which the seismic data is being acquired and or processed is the percentage of actual revenue to the total estimated revenue or ultimate revenue multiplied by the total cost of the project the sales forecast method 
once a multi client data library is complete  the survey data is considered off the shelf and our method of amortization is then the greater of i the sales forecast method or ii the straight line basis over a four year period 
the sales forecast method is our primary method of calculating amortization 
we have determined the amortization period of four years based upon our historical experience that indicates that the majority of our revenues from multi client surveys are derived during the acquisition and processing phases and during four years subsequent to survey completion 
estimated sales are determined based upon discussions with our customers  our experience  and our knowledge of industry trends 
changes in sales estimates may have the effect of changing the percentage relationship of cost of services to revenue 
in applying the sales forecast method  an increase in the projected sales of a survey will result in lower cost of services as a percentage of revenue  and higher earnings when revenue associated with that particular survey is recognized  while a decrease in projected sales will have the opposite effect 
assuming that the overall volume of sales mix of surveys generating revenue in the period was held constant in  an increase in in the sales forecasts of all surveys would have decreased our amortization expense by approximately million 

table of contents we estimate the ultimate revenue expected to be derived from a particular seismic data survey over its estimated useful economic life to determine the costs to amortize  if greater than straight line amortization 
that estimate is made by us at the project s initiation 
for a completed multi client survey  we review the estimate quarterly 
if during any such review  we determine that the ultimate revenue for a survey is expected to be more or less than the original estimate of total revenue for such survey  we decrease or increase as the case may be the amortization rate attributable to the future revenue from such survey 
in addition  in connection with such reviews  we evaluate the recoverability of the multi client data library  and if required under asc accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets  asc record an impairment charge with respect to such data 
there were no impairment charges during and equity method investment we use the equity method of accounting for investments in entities in which we have an ownership interest between and and exercise significant influence 
under this method  an investment is carried at the acquisition cost  plus our equity in undistributed earnings or losses since acquisition 
as provided by asc investments  we record our share of earnings or losses of inova geophysical on a one fiscal quarter lag basis 
thus  our share of inova geophysical s results for the period from march  through september  is included in our financial results for the twelve months ended december  reserve for excess and obsolete inventories our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories is based on historical sales trends and various other assumptions and judgments  including future demand for our inventory and the timing of market acceptance of our new products 
should these assumptions and judgments not be realized for reasons such as delayed market acceptance of our new products  our valuation allowance would be adjusted to reflect actual results 
our industry is subject to technological change and new product development that could result in obsolete inventory 
our valuation reserve for inventory at december  was million compared to million at december  the majority of the decrease in our reserves for excess and obsolete inventory in related to the disposition of our land division 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is allocated to our reporting units  which is either the operating segment or one reporting level below the operating segment 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by asc intangibles goodwill and other asc  we established the following reporting units marine systems  sensor geophone  software  and solutions 
to determine the fair value of our reporting units  we use a discounted future returns valuation method 
if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies  our impairment test results could differ 
in accordance with asc  we are required to evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill at least annually for impairment  or more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not impairment has occurred 
we formally evaluate the carrying value of our goodwill for impairment as of december for each of our reporting units 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit of an entity that includes goodwill is determined to be more than the fair value of the reporting unit  there exists the possibility of impairment of goodwill 
an impairment loss of goodwill is measured in two steps by first allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to net assets and liabilities including recorded and unrecorded other intangible assets to determine the implied carrying value of goodwill 
the next step is to measure the difference between the carrying value of goodwill and the implied carrying value of goodwill  and  if the implied carrying value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of december  and noting no impairments 
in  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million  fully impairing the goodwill in our legacy land systems inova and solutions reporting units 
our remaining goodwill as of december  was comprised of million in our marine systems and million in our software reporting units 
our and annual impairment tests both indicated that the fair value of these two 
table of contents reporting units significantly exceeded their carrying values 
our analyses are based upon our internal operating forecasts  which include assumptions about market and economic conditions 
however  if our estimates or related projections associated with the reporting units significantly change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges 
if the operational results of our segments are lower than forecasted or the economic conditions are worse than expected  then the fair value of our segments will be adversely affected 
our intangible assets other than goodwill relate to proprietary technology  patents  customer relationships and trade names that are amortized over the estimated periods of benefit ranging from to years 
following the guidance of asc  we review the carrying values of these intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not their carrying value may not be recoverable 
any impairment determined is recorded in the current period and is measured by comparing the fair value of the related asset to its carrying value 
for and  we determined that certain of the intangible assets customer relationships  trade names and non compete agreements associated with our aram acquisition now part of inova geophysical were impaired and recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
similar to our treatment of goodwill  in making these assessments  we rely on a number of factors  including operating results  business plans  internal and external economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and external market data 
however  if our estimates or related projections associated with the reporting units significantly change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation under the recognition provisions of asc share based payment asc 
we estimate the value of stock option awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate  and expected dividends 
the accompanying financial statements for include approximately million of stock based compensation expense related to  and asc requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the prior period stock based compensation expense relates to adjustments between estimated and actual forfeitures  which should have been recognized over the vesting period of such awards 
such amounts were not deemed material with respect to either the results of prior years or the results and the trend of earnings for and were therefore recorded in in  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of stock based compensation expense related to our employees outstanding stock based awards 
the total expense in was comprised of million reflected in cost of sales  million in research  development and engineering expense  million in marketing and sales expense  and million in general and administrative expense 
in addition to the stock based compensation expense related to the company s plans  we recorded less than million of stock based compensation expense in related to employee stock appreciation rights 
pursuant to asc  the stock appreciation rights are considered liability awards and  as such  these amounts are accrued in the liability section of the balance sheet 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
credit and sales risks no single customer represented or more of our consolidated net revenues for  and  however  our top five customers in total represented approximately  and  respectively of our 
table of contents consolidated net revenues 
the loss of any significant customers or deterioration in our relationship with these customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for  we recognized million of sales to customers in europe  million of sales to customers in asia pacific  million of sales to customers in africa  million of sales to customers in the middle east  million of sales to customers in latin american countries  and million of sales to customers in the commonwealth of independent states  or former soviet union cis 
the majority of our foreign sales are denominated in us dollars 
for  and  international sales comprised  and  respectively  of total net revenues 
for a number of years  the cis and certain latin american countries have experienced economic problems and uncertainties 
however  given the global downturn that commenced in  more countries and areas of the world have also experienced economic problems and uncertainties 
to the extent that world events or economic conditions negatively affect our future sales to customers in these and other regions of the world or the collectability of our existing receivables  our future results of operations  liquidity  and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we currently require customers in these higher risk countries to provide their own financing and in some cases assist the customer in organizing international financing and export import credit guarantees provided by the united states government 
we do not currently extend long term credit through notes to companies in countries we consider to be inappropriate for credit risk purposes

off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
indemnification in the ordinary course of our business  we enter into contractual arrangements with our customers  suppliers  and other parties under which we may agree to indemnify the other party to such arrangement from certain losses it incurs relating to our products or services or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract 
some of these indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss limitations 
historically  payments we have made related to these indemnification obligations have been immaterial 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our primary market risks include risks related to interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk as of december   we had outstanding total indebtedness of approximately million  including capital lease obligations 
of that indebtedness  approximately million accrues interest under rates that fluctuate based upon market rates plus an applicable margin 
as of december   the million in term loan indebtedness outstanding under the credit facility accrues interest using libor based interest rate of per annum 
the average effective interest rate for the quarter ended december  under the libor based rates for the term loan indebtedness was 
each basis point increase in the interest rate would have the effect of increasing the annual amount of interest to be paid by approximately million 
as our outstanding term loan facility and any borrowings under the revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates  we are subject to interest rate risk 
we are therefore vulnerable to changes in three month libor interest rates 
we use a derivative financial instrument interest rate caps  to manage our exposure to interest rate risks related to the floating rate of our term loan facility 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
we have entered into an interest rate cap agreement for our term loan facility with an initial notional amount of million and with a libor cap of 
at december   the three month libor rate applicable to us was thereby making the cap for the term loan facility out of the money 
subject to the cap  as of december   an increase in market rates of interest 
table of contents by would have increased our annual interest expense related to the term loan facility by million  and a decrease in market interest rates by would have decreased our annual interest expense related to the term loan facility by million 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our operations are conducted in various countries around the world  and we receive revenue from these operations in a number of different currencies with the most significant of our international operations using british pounds sterling 
as such  our earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which is our functional currency  or the functional currency of many of our subsidiaries  which is not necessarily the us dollar 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in currencies other than the us dollar  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars 
through our subsidiaries  we operate in a wide variety of jurisdictions  including united kingdom  china  canada  the netherlands  brazil  russia  the united arab emirates  and other countries 
our financial results may be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our consolidated balance sheet at december  reflected approximately million of net working capital related to our foreign subsidiaries 
a majority of our foreign net working capital is within the united kingdom 
the subsidiaries in those countries receive their income and pay their expenses primarily in their local currencies 
to the extent that transactions of these subsidiaries are settled in the local currencies  a devaluation of these currencies versus the us dollar could reduce the contribution from these subsidiaries to our consolidated results of operations as reported in us dollars
