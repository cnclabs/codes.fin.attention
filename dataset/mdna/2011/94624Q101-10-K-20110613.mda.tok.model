item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the consolidated financial statements include wayne savings bancshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  wayne savings community bank 
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s net income is primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its loans  mortgage backed securities and investments  and its cost of funds consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company s net income also is affected by its provision for loan losses  as well as the amount of noninterest income  including trust income  deposit service charges and gain on the sale of loans into the secondary market  and noninterest expense  such as salaries and employee benefits  federal deposit insurance premiums  occupancy and equipment costs  and income taxes 
earnings of the company also are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities as more fully described under risk factors above 
business strategy the company s current business strategy is to operate a well capitalized  profitable and community oriented bank dedicated to providing quality service and products to its customers 
the company has sought to implement this strategy in recent years by closely monitoring the needs of customers and providing personal  quality customer service  continuing the origination of a wide array of loan products in the company s market area  managing interest rate risk exposure by better matching asset and liability maturities and rates  increasing fee income  including the continuing growth of the trust department and participation in the secondary mortgage market  managing asset quality  maintaining a strong retail deposit base  maintaining capital in excess of regulatory minimum requirements  and emphasizing the commercial loan program to add high quality  higher yielding and shorter duration assets to the company s loan portfolio 
discussion of financial condition changes from march  to march forward looking statements in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
economic circumstances  the company s operations  and actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed herein but also include changes in the economy and interest rates in the nation and the company s general market area 
the forward looking statements contained herein include  but are not limited to  those with respect to the following matters management s determination of the amount and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the effect of changes in interest rates  management s opinion as to the effects of recent accounting pronouncements on the company s consolidated financial statements  and management s opinion as to the bank s ability to maintain regulatory capital at current levels 

table of contents critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the company considers the allowance for loan losses and related loss provision to be a critical accounting policy 
the company has established a systematic method of periodically reviewing the credit quality of the loan portfolio in order to establish a sufficient allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s current judgments about the credit quality of individual loans and segments of the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision  and considers all known internal and external factors that affect loan collectibility as of the reporting date 
such evaluation  which includes a review of all loans on which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  the estimated net realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loan loss experience  management s knowledge of inherent risks in the portfolio that are probable and reasonably estimable and other factors that warrant recognition in providing an appropriate loan loss allowance 
goodwill the company recorded all assets and liabilities acquired in prior purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangibles  at fair value as required 
goodwill is subject  at a minimum  to annual tests for impairment 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method  and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the initial goodwill and other intangibles recorded and subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired asset will perform in the future 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  customer attrition  changes in revenue growth trends  specific industry conditions and changes in competition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
at march   total assets increased to million from the million total at march  mainly due to increases in available for sale securities of million  partially offset by a decrease in loans of million  a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million and a decline in foreclosed assets of  during the fiscal year ended march   loans receivable decreased million  or  as the bank originated and retained million of loans  received payments of million and transferred million to foreclosed assets held for sale 
rather than reinvest funds from repayments on loans in long term  fixed rate and lower yielding residential loans  management has invested in shorter term mortgage backed securities to limit interest rate risk and to provide liquidity in the current rate environment 
at march  and  the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of net loans and million  or  of net loans  respectively 
in determining the amount of the loan loss allowance at any point of time  management and the board systematically determine the risk of loss in the portfolio 
first  delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans are evaluated for potential impairment in carrying value 
at march   all delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans were analyzed  with million of the reserve being allocated to these categories of loans 
the largest loan in this category totaled million at march  the second step in determining the allowance for loan losses entails the application of historic loss experience to individual loan types in the portfolio 
in addition to the historic loss percentage  management employs an additional risk percentage tailored to the board s and management s perception of the overall risk in the economy 
finally  to provide additional assurance regarding the validity of the commercial loan risk rating system  management engages a third party loan reviewer who provides independent validation of the bank s loan grading process 
management recorded a  provision for losses on loans for fiscal  a decrease of million from the million recorded for the fiscal year ended march  
table of contents goodwill of million is carried on the company s balance sheet as a result of the acquisition of stebbins bancshares in june in accordance with fasb asc  this goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
management evaluated the goodwill using an analysis of required measures of value  including the current stock price as an indicator of minority interest value  change of control multiples as a measure of controlling interest value and discounted cash flow analysis as a measure of going concern value and applied a weighting based on appraisal standards to arrive at a valuation conclusion that indicated no impairment at march  a prepaid asset of million was created in the third fiscal quarter of due to the fdic imposing a prepaid assessment on all insured institutions  including the company s subsidiary 
the amount of the prepaid premium covered the fourth calendar quarter of and all of calendar years  and and included a deposit growth assumption 
actual deposit insurance premium expense is calculated by the fdic on a quarterly basis  with the expense being charged to the prepaid asset 
any balance remaining in june  will be refunded to the company s subsidiary bank 
the balance at march  is million 
deposits totaled million at march   an increase of million  or  from march  savings and money market accounts increased by million  or  and demand accounts increased million  or  partially offset by a decrease in certificates of deposit of million  or 
the company experienced an increase in low cost liquid deposit accounts as customers chose to keep funds in more liquid types of accounts due to the low level of market interest rates and as management exercised discipline during the period with regard to the pricing of retail certificates 
in general  management attempts to benchmark retail certificate of deposit pricing to the cost of alternate sources of funds  including fhlb advances and brokered deposits 
exceptions are made to defend customer relationships with significant value to the bank while allowing rate sensitive certificate of deposit shoppers to move to other alternatives 
other short term borrowings decreased by million as a result of a decrease in commercial repurchase agreements by rate sensitive customers  as reduced economic activity appears to be reducing excess cash balances for a number of the company s customers 
advances from the fhlb decreased million  from million at march  to million at march  during fiscal  million in variable rate  short term cash management advances were taken and paid off within the period 
another million of fixed rate and term advances matured and were renewed into million of new fixed rate and term advances maturing in and to extend liability duration for interest rate risk management purposes at a cost lower than attempting to extend liability duration through the acquisition or retention of retail certificates of deposit 
finally  during december  the bank modified million of existing fixed rate and term advances to reduce the carrying cost and extend the maturity dates of those advances into and to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment and to again extend liability duration at a cost lower than the use of retail certificates of deposit 
as part of this restructuring transaction  a  prepayment penalty was paid and deferred 
the remaining unamortized balance of  is reflected as a reduction in the carrying value of advances and will be amortized into interest expense over the remaining term of the new advances 
stockholders equity totaled million  an increase of million  or  during the year ended march   due primarily to million in net income for the fiscal year ended march  and amortization of the esop shares of  the increases were offset by decreases of  in accumulated other comprehensive income  resulting mainly from a reduction to the unrealized gains on available for sale securities  and cash dividends totaling  during fiscal 
table of contents comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and general net income totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of  from net income for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in net income was primarily attributable to a decrease in net interest income of  a decrease in noninterest income of  and an increase in noninterest expenses of  partially offset by a decrease in the provision for losses on loans of million and reduced provision for federal income taxes of  interest income interest income decreased million or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to fiscal this decrease was mainly due to a decrease in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets to from for the fiscal year ended march   offset by an increase in the average balance of million  or 
the yield decrease was primarily due to the reduction in overall market rates 
these rate decreases have negatively affected the yields earned on the company s interest earning assets 
interest income on loans decreased million  or  for the year ended march   compared to fiscal  due primarily to a million  or  decrease in the average balance of loans year over year coupled with a basis point decrease in the weighted average yield on loans outstanding 
the decrease in the yield was due to the decrease in market interest rates and the corresponding downward impact on new originations 
interest income on securities decreased  or  during fiscal  compared to fiscal  due primarily to a decrease of basis points in the weighted average yield to as compared to  from the comparable period  generally reflecting reinvestment in lower yielding mortgage backed securities as higher yielding securities prepaid or matured  offset with an increase of million  or  in the average balance 
interest income on interest earning deposits decreased by  or  for the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to a decrease in the weighted average yield of basis points to  partially offset with an increase in the average balance of  or 
the decrease in the yield was primarily due to the overall decrease in market rates 
interest expense interest expense for the fiscal year ended march   totaled million  a decrease of million  or  compared to interest expense for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease in interest expense resulted from a decrease in the weighted average cost of funds of basis points to for fiscal  offset by an increase of million  or  in the average balance of deposits and borrowings outstanding in fiscal interest expense on deposits totaled million for fiscal  a decrease of million  or  compared to fiscal the decrease in deposit costs resulted from a decrease of basis points in the weighted average cost of deposits to for fiscal  offset with an increase in the average balance outstanding of million  or 
in addition  as noted earlier  a shift in the composition of deposits from higher cost certificates of deposit to lower cost checking and savings accounts contributed to the decrease in the cost of deposits  along with a general decline in overall market rates 

table of contents interest expense on other short term borrowings totaled  for the year ended march   a decrease of  or  from the period  due primarily to a decrease in the weighted average balance decrease of million  or 
interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the year ended march   a decrease of  or  from the period  due primarily to a decrease in the weighted average rate of basis points to for the fiscal year ended march   as a result of lower interest rates on renewed advances  combined with a decrease in the average balance of million  or 
the decrease in the average balance was due to decreased borrowings as funds from deposit growth were used to repay advances 
net interest income net interest income totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of  or  from the amount for fiscal the decrease in interest income was mainly due to the repricing effect of the overall low rate environment combined with the shift in composition of loans into lower yielding mortgage backed securities 
the average interest rate spread decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the net interest margin decreased to for fiscal from for the fiscal year ended march  the basis point decrease in the yield on average interest earning assets was partially offset by the basis point decrease in the cost of funds 
as noted earlier  a decrease in overall market interest rates and shift in the composition of deposits from higher cost certificates of deposit to lower cost checking and savings accounts contributed to the decrease in the cost of deposits 
provision for losses on loans the company recorded a provision for losses on loans totaling  for the fiscal year ended march   compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  the principal reasons for the decreased provision are a decrease in the size of the loan portfolio and a modest relative improvement in the economic conditions in the company s market area  partially offset by an increase in amounts required to be allocated within the allowance for loan losses to address loans individually evaluated for impairment 
in the opinion of management  as of march   the carrying value of all non performing loans as of march   is expected to be realized 
noninterest income noninterest income  consisting primarily of earnings on bank owned life insurance policies  gains on sale of loans  gains on the sale of securities designated as available for sale  trust income and deposit service fees decreased by  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   from million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in service fees  charges and other operating income of  a reduction of  in gain on the sale of available for sale securities  as there were no securities sales in  and a  decrease in gain on sale of loans 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in gains from disposal of real estate acquired through foreclosure of  an increase in trust income of  and a  increase in bank owned life insurance income 
both trust income and earnings on bank owned life insurance were up by  and  respectively  as trust portfolio market values and insurance portfolio yields increased year over year 
as described under item above  management engages in limited sales of newly originated loans to limit the buildup of interest rate risk on the balance sheet and to provide liquidity to accommodate additional refinancing activity 
the company sold million loans in fiscal compared to million in fiscal deposit service fees decreased  due to a decline in transaction and overdraft volume 

table of contents noninterest expense noninterest expense increased by  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to the fiscal year ended march  the increase in noninterest expense was primarily due to an increase of  in provision for impairment based on continuing decreases in the carrying values of foreclosed assets held for sale coupled with a  or  increase in salaries and benefits costs 
the increase in salaries and employee benefits was primarily from merit increases  increased employee healthcare and other employee benefit costs 
these increases were offset by a decrease in federal deposit insurance premiums of  as there was no special assessment imposed on all insured institutions as in  a reduction in occupancy and equipment expense of  coupled with an other operating expense reduction of  the decrease in occupancy and equipment expense of  or  was a result of decreased depreciation expense  as older equipment was fully depreciated and management carefully controlled the purchase of new capital items  and reduced data processing costs associated with new equipment and renegotiated data processing contracts 
federal income taxes federal income tax expense was  for the year ended march   reflecting a decrease of  from fiscal primarily due to a decrease of  in pre tax income  partially offset by additional tax exempt securities purchased during the year 
the difference in the effective tax rate of from the statutory rate was mainly due to the beneficial effects of income from the cash surrender value of life insurance and other tax exempt obligations 

table of contents average balance sheet the following tables set forth certain information relating to the company s average balance sheet and reflects the average yield on assets and average cost of liabilities for the periods indicated 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities  respectively  for the periods presented

interest rate spread represents the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
net yield on interest earning assets represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 

table of contents rate volume analysis the table below sets forth certain information regarding changes in interest income and interest expense of the company for the periods indicated 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in average volume changes in average volume multiplied by old rate  and ii changes in rate change in rate multiplied by old average volume 
changes in rate volume changes in rate multiplied by the change in average volume have been allocated proportionately between changes in rate and changes in volume

while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank manages the pricing of deposits to maintain a desired level of deposits and cost of funds 
in addition  the bank invests excess funds in federal funds and other short term interest earning assets  which provide liquidity to meet lending requirements 
liquid assets outstanding at march  and  amounted to million and million  respectively 
for additional information about cash flows from the company s operating  financing and investing activities  see the statements of cash flows included in the consolidated financial statements 
a major portion of the bank s liquidity consists of cash and cash equivalents  which are a product of operating  investing and financing activities 
the primary sources of cash are net income  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from deposits and advances from the fhlb  and sales of residential mortgage loans and investment securities 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management 
if the bank requires funds beyond its ability to generate funds internally at a reasonable cost  borrowing agreements exist with the fhlb  which provide an additional source of funds 
as noted above  fhlb advances are used as part of an overall liability management strategy to extend duration for interest rate risk management purposes generally at a cost lower than equivalent duration retail certificates 
at march   the company had million in outstanding advances from the fhlb offset with a prepayment penalty of  due to the restructuring of three fhlb advances as described above 
at march   the company had additional borrowing capacity from the fhlb totaling million based on the bank s one to four family residential mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities  home equity lines of credit  second mortgage loans and multifamily loans 
the bank also has 
table of contents pledged million to secure a line of credit with the federal reserve bank of million which is in place to provide a backup  short term source of liquidity 
the bank has the ability to pledge remaining investment and mortgage backed securities of million which would allow the bank the ability to borrow additional longer term funds from the fhlb 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at march  payments due by period less than year years years more than years total in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations advances from the federal home loan bank other short term borrowings certificates of deposit maturities amount of commitments expiring per period commitments to originate loans letters of credit credit card overdraft lines of credit home equity commercial lines of credit one to four family and multi family loans total contractual obligations impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management interest rate sensitivity analysis the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that interest earning assets reprice at a different time than interest bearing liabilities 
as part of its effort to monitor and manage interest rate risk  the bank uses the net portfolio value npv methodology adopted by the ots as part of its interest rate sensitivity regulations 
the application of npv methodology illustrates certain aspects of the bank s interest rate risk 
generally  npv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning and other assets and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the npv  which would result from a theoretical change in market interest rates 

table of contents asset and liability management interest rate sensitivity analysis continued presented below  as of march  and  is an analysis of the bank s interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained  and basis point basis point equals 
increases and a basis point decrease in market interest rates 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the npv approach 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayment on loans and mortgage backed securities and early withdrawal levels from certificates of deposit would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in making the risk calculations 
as of march  net portfolio value change in net portfolio value as of pv of assets interest rates basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp   bp bp   bp   bp  bp   as of march  net portfolio value change in net portfolio value as of pv of assets interest rates basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp   bp bp   bp   bp  bp   the company attempts to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk generally by better matching the maturities of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
strategies include originating arm loans and other adjustable rate or short term loans  as well as by purchasing short term investment and mortgage backed securities and extending liabilities through promoting cost effective long term retail certificates of deposit or the use of long term fhlb advances 
however  particularly in the current interest rate and credit market environment  borrowers typically prefer fixed rate loans to arm loans 
accordingly  arm loan originations were very limited during the fiscal year ended march  similarly  depositors currently prefer more liquid and short duration checking  money market and savings accounts to longer term certificate of deposit accounts 
the net effect of this continuing shift in customer preference for longer duration loans and shorter duration deposits has been to expose the company to increased interest rate risk 
the company has an asset liability management committee alco  which is responsible for reviewing the company s asset liability policies 
the committee meets and reports monthly to the board of directors on interest rate risks and trends  as well as liquidity and capital ratios and requirements 
the bank has operated within the framework of its prescribed npv risk range for each of the last three years
