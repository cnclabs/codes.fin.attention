internet solutions accounted for of our total revenue for each of the years ended december   and see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form k for a discussion on trends in this customer solutions set 
growth of our internet solutions business depends upon the development of improved and new products targeted to our primary customer segments  as well as the development of internet products targeted to the needs of customer segments outside our core audience

our sales force we rely primarily on our sales force of approximately  team members worldwide to sell our customers solutions  of which approximately  were in our north american segment and  were in our international segment as of december  our sales force includes relationship managers and solution specialists who sell to our strategic and commercial customers  telesales teams  a team that sells to federal  state and local governments  and a team that sells to resellers of our solutions and our data 
our global sales force is also a source of competitive advantage  which allows us to go to market across three key customer segments 
we identify these customer segments as strategic customers  commercial customers or middle market in our international businesses  and small businesses 
our customers we believe that different size customers have different needs and require different skill sets to service them 
accordingly  we have adopted a go to market sales strategy that focuses on distinct groups categorized internally as large customers  middle market customers and small business customers 
our principal customers within these groups are banks and other credit and financial institutions  manufacturers  wholesalers  retailers  government agencies  insurance companies and telecommunication companies  as well as sales  marketing and business development professionals 
none of our customers accounted for more than of our total revenue or of the revenue of our north american or international segments 
accordingly  neither we nor either of our segments is dependent on a single customer  such that a loss of any one would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated annual results of operations or the annual results of either of our segments 
competition we are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
however  we believe no competitor offers our complete line of solutions or can match our global data quality resulting from our dunsright quality process 
in north america  we are a market leader in our risk management solutions business in terms of revenue 
we compete with our customers own internal business practices by continually developing more efficient alternatives to our customers risk management processes to capture more of their internal spend 
we also directly compete with a broad range of companies  including consumer credit companies such as equifax  inc and experian information solutions  inc 
experian  which have traditionally offered primarily consumer information services  but also offer products that combine consumer information with business information as a tool to help customers make credit decisions with respect to small businesses 
we also compete in north america with a broad range of companies offering solutions similar to our sales marketing solutions 
our direct competitors in sales marketing solutions include companies such as experian and infogroup infousa 
in our internet solutions  hoover s competition varies based on the size of the customer and the level of spending available for services such as hoover s online 
on the high end of product pricing  hoover s researcher  hoover s prospector and hoover s relationship manager products compete with other business information providers such as infousa 
new  less established entrants are also pursuing some of these same customers 
on the lower end of product pricing  our hoover s exec and lite solutions mainly competes with advertising supported internet sites and other free or low priced information sources  such as yahoo finance and marketwatch  inc outside the us  the competitive environment varies by region and country 
in europe  our direct competition is primarily local  such as experian in the uk 
in addition  we compete with certain companies such as coface for cross border business 
however  we believe we offer superior solutions when compared to these networks because of our dunsright quality process 
in addition  the sales marketing solutions landscape is both localized and fragmented throughout europe  where numerous local players of varying size compete for business 
in asia  we face competition in our risk management solutions business from a mix of local and global providers 
for example  we compete with sinotrust in china  which is majority owned by experian  with teikoku data bank tdb in japan and with experian in india 
in addition  as in europe  the sales marketing solutions landscape throughout asia is localized and fragmented 
we also face significant competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and business information services  and credit insurers 
for example  in certain international markets  such as europe  some credit insurers have identified the provision of credit information as an additional revenue stream 
in addition  business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services 
as discussed in our aspiration and our strategy above  we believe that our trusted brand  our dunsright quality process  our winning culture and our financial flexibility form a powerful competitive advantage 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based on a number of factors  including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our existing and new products and services based upon our proprietary dunsright quality process and  as a result  improve customer satisfaction  maintain and develop proprietary information and services such as analytics eg  scoring and sources of data not publicly available  leverage our brand perception and the value of our d b worldwide network  maintain those third party relationships on whom we rely for data and certain operational services  and attract and retain a high performing workforce 
intellectual property we own and control various intellectual property rights  such as trade secrets  confidential information  trademarks  service marks  trade names  copyrights  patents and applications therefor 
these rights  in the aggregate  are of material importance to our business 
we also believe that the d b name and related trade names  marks and logos are of material importance to our business 
we are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by others  and other companies are licensed to use certain technology and other intellectual property rights owned and controlled by us 
we consider our trademarks  service marks  databases  software  copyrights  patents  patent applications and other intellectual property to be proprietary  and we rely on a combination of statutory eg  copyright  trademark  trade secret  patent  etc 
and contract and liability safeguards for protection thereof throughout the world 
unless the context indicates otherwise  the names of our branded solutions and services referred to in this annual report on form k are trademarks  service marks or registered trademarks or service marks owned by or licensed to us or one or more of our subsidiaries 
we own patents and patent applications both in the us and in other selected countries of importance to us 
the patents and patent applications include claims which pertain to certain technologies which we have determined are proprietary and warrant patent protection 
we believe that the protection of our innovative technology  especially technology pertaining to our proprietary dunsright quality process  through the filing of patent applications is a prudent business strategy  and we will continue to seek to protect those assets for which we have expended substantial capital 
filing of these patent applications may or may not provide us with a dominant position in the fields of technology 
however  these patents and or patent applications may provide us with legal defenses should subsequent patents in these fields be issued to third parties and later asserted against us 
where appropriate  we may also consider asserting or cross licensing our patents 
employees as of december   we employed approximately  team members worldwide  of which approximately  were in our north american segment and corporate and approximately  were in our international segment 
we believe that we have good relations with our employees 
there are no unions in the north american segment 
works councils and trade unions represent a portion of our employees in the european and latin american operations of our international segment

item a 
risk factors our business model is dependent upon third parties to provide data and certain operational services  the loss of which would materially impact our business and financial results 
we rely significantly on third parties to support our business model 
for example we obtain much of the data that we use from third parties  including public record sources  we utilize single source providers in certain countries to support the needs of our customers around the globe and rely on members of our d b worldwide network to provide local data in countries in which we do not directly operate  we have outsourced certain portions of our data acquisition  processing and delivery and customer service and call center processes  and we have also outsourced various functions  such as our data center operations  technology help desk and network management functions in the us and the uk 
if one or more data providers were to experience financial or operational difficulties or were to withdraw their data  cease making it available  be unable to make it available due to changing industry standards  substantially increase the cost of their data  not adhere to our data quality standards  or be acquired by a competitor who would cause any of these disruptions to occur  our ability to provide solutions and services to our customers could be materially adversely impacted  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
similarly  if one of our outsource providers  including third parties with whom we have strategic relationships  were to experience financial or operational difficulties  their services to us would suffer or they may no longer be able to provide services to us at all  having a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we cannot be certain that we could replace our large third party vendors in a timely manner or on terms commercially reasonable to us 
in addition  if we change a significant outsource provider  an existing provider makes significant changes to the way it conducts its operations  or we seek to bring in house certain services performed today by third parties  we may experience unexpected disruptions in the provision of our solutions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our business performance is dependent upon successful implementation and the ongoing operation of our strategic technology investment  and appropriate investment in our technology infrastructure thereafter  the failure of which could materially impact our business and financial results 
in february  we announced a strategic technology investment program aimed at strengthening our leading position in commercial data and improving our current technology platform to meet the emerging needs of customers 
we will rely in part on third party providers to implement and update certain aspects of our technology infrastructure and to thereafter run certain of such operations both from within d b and from their own remote locations 
upon completion of this investment  we expect that it will simplify and re architect our data supply chain in order to  among other things  supply intra day updates  create a services layer to optimize access to our data for customers and third parties and to make it easier for us to innovate and develop new products  consolidate many of our legacy products to provide fewer but more impactful applications for customers  accelerate revenue growth in our north american segment upon the completion of the investment  and significantly reduce our technology costs upon completion of the investment 
we expect the strategic technology investment to be completed during the second half of and the total cost to be closer to the higher end of our previously disclosed range of approximately million to million 
in the event we fail to execute on this investment in a timely manner and or without interruption to service  including hiring and retaining appropriate technology personnel  engaging and managing third parties  re architecting our data supply chain  and simplifying our product portfolio while migrating our customers to new products  and maintaining such data and technology operations on an ongoing basis  we will not achieve our expected revenue acceleration or growth  or the anticipated cost savings from this investment  and we could experience a significant competitive disadvantage in the marketplace  such as the inability to offer certain types of new services or to collect certain types of new data  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
in addition  upon the successful completion of our strategic technology investment  if we fail to appropriately invest in our technology infrastructure thereafter  we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we may be unable to achieve the financial and operational expectations that we have established for the timeframe  which could negatively impact our stock price 
we have established financial and operational expectations for the timeframe that we believe would be achieved based upon our business strategy for the next several years 
these financial and operational expectations can only be achieved if the assumptions underlying our business strategy are fully realized  including the achievement of our strategic technology investment 
in addition  we cannot control some of these assumptions eg  market growth rates  macroeconomic conditions  competitive conditions  pricing pressure and customer preferences 
as part of our ongoing planning process we will review these assumptions and we intend to provide updates on these expectations from time to time as appropriate 
we face competition that may cause price reductions or loss of market share 
we are subject to competitive conditions in all aspects of our business 
we compete directly with a broad range of companies offering business information services to customers 
we also face competition from the in house operations of the businesses we seek as customers  other general and specialized credit reporting and other business information services  and credit insurers 
in addition  business information solutions and services are becoming more readily available  principally due to the expansion of the internet  greater availability of public data and the emergence of new providers of business information solutions and services 
large internet companies can provide low cost alternatives to data gathering and change how our customers perform key activities such as marketing campaigns 
such companies  and other third parties which may not be readily apparent today  may become significant low cost or no cost competitors and adversely impact the demand for our solutions and services  or limit our growth potential 
weak economic conditions also can result in customers seeking to utilize free or lower cost information that is available from alternative sources such as the internet and european commission sponsored projects like the european business register 
intense competition could adversely impact us by causing  among other things  price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share 
we are facing competition outside the us  and our competitors could develop an alternative to our d b worldwide network 
we are also facing competition from consumer credit companies that offer consumer information solutions to help their customers make credit decisions regarding small businesses 
in addition  consumer information companies are seeking to expand their operations more broadly into aspects of the business information space 
while their presence is currently small in the business information market  given the size of the consumer market in which they operate  they have scale advantages in terms of scope of operations and size of relationship with customers  which they can potentially leverage to an advantage 
our ability to continue to compete effectively will be based upon a number of factors  including our ability to communicate and demonstrate to our customers the value of our products and services based upon our proprietary dunsright quality process and  as a result  improve customer satisfaction  maintain and develop proprietary information and services such as analytics eg  scoring  and sources of data not publicly available  such as detailed trade data  demonstrate value through our decision making tools and integration capabilities  leverage our brand perception and the value of our d b worldwide network  continue to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy and effectively reallocate our spending  obtain and deliver reliable and high quality business and professional contact information through various media and distribution channels in formats tailored to customer requirements  adopt and maintain an effective information technology infrastructure  including our approximately two year strategic technology investment  to support product delivery as customer needs and preferences change and competitors offer more sophisticated products  attract and retain a high performance workforce  enhance our existing services and introduce new services  enter new customer markets  and improve our international business model and data quality through the successful management of the members of our d b worldwide network and through our undertaking of acquisitions or entering into joint ventures or similar relationships 
our business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the full year financial guidance that we provide publicly 
we provide full year financial guidance to the public which is based upon our assumptions regarding our expected financial performance 
this includes  for example  assumptions regarding our ability to grow revenue  to grow operating income  to achieve desired tax rates and to generate cash 
we believe that our financial guidance provides investors and analysts with a better understanding of our view of our near term financial performance 
such financial guidance may not always be accurate  due to our inability to meet the assumptions we make and the impact on our financial performance that could occur as a result of the various risks and uncertainties to our business as set forth in these risk factors and in our public filings with the sec or otherwise 
if we fail to meet the full year financial guidance that we provide or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance as we conduct our operations throughout the year  the market value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected 
we may lose key business assets or suffer interruptions in product delivery  including loss of data center capacity or the interruption of telecommunications links  the internet  or power sources which could significantly impede our ability to do business 
our operations depend on our ability  as well as that of third party service providers to whom we have outsourced several critical functions  to protect data centers and related technology against damage from hardware failure  fire  power loss  telecommunications failure  impacts of terrorism  breaches in security such as the actions of computer hackers  the theft of services  natural disasters  or other disasters 
the online services we provide are dependent on links to telecommunications providers 
in addition  we generate a significant amount of our revenue through telesales centers and internet sites that we use in the acquisition of new customers  fulfillment of solutions and services and responding to customer inquiries 
we may not have sufficient redundant operations or change management processes in connection with our introduction of new online products or services to prevent a loss or failure in all of these areas in a timely manner 
any damage to our data centers  failure of our telecommunications links or inability to access these telesales centers or internet sites could cause interruptions in operations that adversely affect our ability to meet our customers requirements and materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
a failure in the integrity of our database could harm our brand and result in a loss of sales and an increase in legal claims 
the reliability of our solutions is dependent upon the integrity of the data in our global database 
we have in the past been subject to customer and third party complaints and lawsuits regarding our data  which have occasionally been resolved by the payment of money damages 
a failure in the integrity of our database  whether inadvertently or through the actions of a third party  which may be on the rise  could harm us by exposing us to customer or third party claims or by causing a loss of customer confidence in our solutions 
in addition  we must continue to invest in our database to improve and maintain the quality  timeliness and coverage of the data contained therein if we are to maintain our competitive positioning in the marketplace 
also  we have licensed  and we may license in the future  proprietary rights to third parties 
while we attempt to ensure that the quality of our brand is maintained by the third parties to whom we grant such licenses and by customers  they may take actions that could materially adversely affect the value of our proprietary rights or our reputation 
in addition  it cannot be assured that these licensees and customers will take the same steps we have taken to prevent misappropriation of our data solutions or technologies 
our brand and reputation are key assets and competitive advantages of our company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace 
our brand and its attributes are key assets of the company 
our ability to attract and retain customers is highly dependent upon the external perceptions of our level of data quality  effective provision of services  business practices  including actions of our employees  third party providers and members of the d b worldwide network  that are not consistent with d b s policies and standards  and overall financial condition 
negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation with customers and the public  which could make it difficult for us to attract and maintain customers 
adverse developments with respect to our industry may also  by association  negatively impact our reputation  or result in higher regulatory or legislative scrutiny 
although we monitor developments for areas of potential risk to our reputation and brand  negative perceptions or publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we rely on annual contract renewals for a substantial part of our revenue  and our quarterly results may be significantly impacted by the timing of these renewals or a shift in product mix that results in a change in the timing of revenue recognition 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from annual customer contracts 
if we are unable to renew a significant number of these contracts  our revenue and results of operations would be harmed 
in addition  our results of operations from period to period may vary due to the timing of customer contract renewals 
as contracts are renewed  we have  and may continue to experience  a shift in product mix underlying such contracts 
this could result in the deferral of increased amounts of revenue into future periods as a larger portion of revenue is recognized over the term of our contracts rather than upfront at contract signing or the acceleration of deferred revenue into an earlier reporting period 
although this may cause our financial results from period to period to vary substantially  such change in revenue recognition would not change the total revenue recognized over the life of our contracts 
we may be adversely affected by the global economic environment 
as a result of the macro economic challenges currently affecting the economy of the united states and other parts of the world  our customers or vendors may experience problems with their earnings  cash flow  or both 
this may cause our customers to delay  cancel or significantly decrease their purchases from us  and we may experience delays in payment or their inability to pay amounts owed to us 
in addition  our vendors may substantially increase their prices to us and without notice 
any such change in the behavior of our customers or vendors may materially adversely affect our earnings and cash flow 
if economic conditions in the united states and other key markets deteriorate or do not show improvement  we may experience material adverse impacts to our business  operating results  and or access to credit markets 
changes in the legislative  regulatory and commercial environments in which we operate may adversely impact our ability to collect  compile  use and publish data and may impact our financial results 
certain types of information we collect  compile  use and publish are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in certain jurisdictions in which we operate  particularly in our international markets 
in addition  there is increasing awareness and concern among the general public and companies regarding marketing and privacy matters  particularly as they relate to individual privacy interests and the ubiquity of the internet 
these concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations 
in general  compliance with existing laws and regulations has not to date materially impacted our business and financial results 
nonetheless  future laws and regulations with respect to the collection  compilation  use and publication of information  and adverse publicity or litigation concerning the commercial use of such information could result in limitations being imposed on our operations  increased compliance or litigation expense and or loss of revenue  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
our business also relies on the availability of the internet as it is currently configured and operated both to obtain data and services and to provide data and services to our customers 
if the rules governing the operation of the internet were to change  such as  for example  by permitting broadband suppliers to discriminate in providing access to their networks  this could have a material adverse impact on our business 
in addition  governmental agencies may seek  from time to time  to increase the fees or taxes that we must pay to acquire  use and or redistribute data that such governmental agencies collect 
while we would seek to pass along any such price increases to our customers or provide alternative services  there is no guarantee that we would be able to do so  given competitive pressures or other considerations 
in addition  any such price increases or alternative services may result in reduced usage by our customers and or loss of market share 
we may be unable to adapt successfully to changes in our customers preferences for our solutions  which could materially adversely affect our revenues 
our success depends in part on our ability to adapt our solutions to our customers preferences 
advances in information technology and uncertain or changing economic conditions are changing the way our customers use and purchase business information 
as a result  our customers are demanding both lower prices and more features from our solutions  such as decision making tools like credit scores and electronic delivery formats  and are expecting real time data provided in a manner relevant to them 
if we do not successfully adapt our solutions to our customers preferences  our business and financial results would be materially adversely affected 
specifically  for our larger customers  our continued success will be dependent on our ability to satisfy more of their needs by providing more breadth and depth of data and allowing them more flexibility to use our data through web services and third party solutions 
for our smaller customers  our success will depend in part on our ability to develop a strong value proposition  including simplifying our solutions and pricing offerings  to enhance our marketing efforts to these customers and to improve our service to them 
acquisitions  joint ventures or similar strategic relationships may disrupt or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
as part of our strategy  we may seek to acquire other complementary businesses  products and technologies or enter into joint ventures or similar strategic relationships 
these transactions are subject to the following risks acquisitions  joint ventures or similar relationships may cause a disruption in our ongoing business  distract our management and make it difficult to maintain our standards  controls and procedures  we may not be able to integrate successfully the services  content  products and personnel of any such transaction into our operations  we may not derive the revenue improvements  cost savings and other intended benefits of any such transaction  and there may be risks  exposures and liabilities of acquired entities or other third parties with whom we undertake a transaction  that may arise from such third parties activities prior to undertaking a transaction with us 
we have no direct management control over third party members of the d b worldwide network who conduct business under the d b brand name in local markets or other third parties who license and sell under the d b name 
the d b worldwide network is comprised of wholly owned subsidiaries  joint ventures that we either control or hold a minority interest in  and third party members who conduct business under the d b brand name in local markets 
while third party member participation in the d b worldwide network and certain of our relationships with other third parties are controlled by commercial services agreements and the use of our trademarks is controlled by license agreements  we have no direct management control over these members or third parties beyond the terms of the agreements 
as a result  actions or inactions taken by these third parties may have a material impact on our business and financial results 
for example  one or more third parties or members may provide a product or service that does not adhere to our data quality standards  fail to comply with d b brand and communication standards  engage in illegal or unethical business practices  elect not to support new or revised products and services or other strategic initiatives  fail to execute other data or distribution contract requirements  or refuse to provide new sources of data 
such actions or inactions may have an impact on customer confidence in the d b brand globally  which could materially adversely impact our business and financial results 
we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel  including members of our sales force and technology team  which could impact the quality of our performance and customer satisfaction 
our success and financial results also depend on our continuing ability to attract  retain and motivate highly qualified personnel at all levels and to appropriately use the time and resources of such individuals 
this includes members of our sales force on whom we rely for generating the vast majority of our revenue  and members of our technology team on whom we rely to continually maintain and upgrade all of our technology operations and to maintain and develop our products 
competition for these individuals is intense  and we may not be able to retain our key personnel or key members of our sales or technology teams  or attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified individuals in the future 
we have from time to time experienced  and we expect to continue to experience  difficulty in hiring and retaining employees  including members of our sales force and technology team  who have appropriate qualifications 
our international business is subject to various risks associated with operations in foreign countries  which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
our success depends in part on our various operations outside north america 
for the three years ended december   and  our international segment accounted for  and of total revenue  respectively 
our international business is subject to many of the same challenges as our domestic business  as well as the following our competition is primarily local  and our customers may have greater loyalty to our local competitors which may have a competitive advantage because they are not restricted by us laws with which we require our international segment to comply  such as the foreign corrupt practices act  while our services have not usually been regulated  governments  particularly in emerging market areas  may adopt legislation or regulations governing the collection  compilation  use and or publication of the kinds of information we collect  compile  use and publish  which could bar or impede our ability to operate and this could adversely impact our business  credit insurance is a significant credit risk mitigation tool in certain markets that may reduce the demand for our risk management solutions  and in some markets  key data elements are generally available from public sector sources  thus reducing a customer s need to purchase that data from us 
our international strategy includes the leveraging of our d b worldwide network to improve our data quality 
we form and manage strategic relationships to create a competitive advantage for us over the long term  however  these strategic relationships may not be successful or may be subject to ownership change 
the issue of data privacy is an increasingly important area of public policy in various international markets  and we operate in an evolving regulatory environment that could adversely impact aspects of our business or the business of third parties on whom we depend 
our operating results could also be negatively affected by a variety of other factors affecting our foreign operations  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors may include currency fluctuations  economic  political or regulatory conditions  competition from government agencies in a specific country or region  trade protection measures and other regulatory requirements 
additional risks inherent in international business activities generally include  among others longer accounts receivable payment cycles  the costs and difficulties of managing international operations and strategic alliances  including the d b worldwide network  and the need to comply with a broader array of regulatory and licensing requirements  the failure of which could result in fines  penalties or business suspensions 
we may be unable to reduce our expense base through our financial flexibility  and the related reinvestments from savings from this program may not produce the level of desired revenue growth which would materially adversely affect our business and financial results 
successful execution of our strategy includes reducing our expense base through our financial flexibility initiatives  and reallocating our expense base reductions into initiatives to produce our desired revenue growth 
the success of this program may be affected by our ability to continually adapt and improve our organizational design and efficiency to meet the changing needs of our business and our customers  our ability to implement the actions required under this program within the established time frame  our ability to implement actions that require process or technology changes to reduce our expense base  our ability to enter into or amend agreements with third party vendors to obtain terms beneficial to us  managing third party vendor relationships effectively  completing agreements with our local works councils and trade unions related to potential reengineering actions in certain international markets  and maintaining quality around key business processes utilizing our reduced and or outsourced resources

on december   we sold our italian real estate business for million  which was a part of our international segment  and we have reclassified the historical financial results of the italian real estate business as discontinued operations 
we have reflected the results of this business as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of earnings for all periods presented as set forth in this annual report on form k 
we have recorded the resulting gain of million both pre tax and after tax from the sale in the first quarter of in the consolidated statement of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations how we manage our business for internal management purposes  we refer to core revenue  which we calculate as total operating revenue less the revenue of divested businesses 
core revenue is used to manage and evaluate the performance of our segments and to allocate resources because this measure provides an indication of the underlying changes in revenue in a single performance measure 
core revenue does not include reported revenue of divested businesses since they are not included in future revenue 
on july   we completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of our north american self awareness solution business 
this business has been classified as a divested business 
this divested business contributed  and of our north america total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for further detail 
on may   we completed the sale of substantially all the assets and liabilities of the domestic portion of our italian operations 
this business has been classified as a divested business 
this divested business contributed and of our international total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
see note and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for further detail 
we also isolate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our revenue growth because we believe it is useful for investors to be able to compare revenue from one period to another  both with and without the effects of foreign exchange 
the change in our operating performance attributable to foreign currency rates is determined by converting both our prior and current periods by a constant rate 
as a result  we monitor our core revenue growth both after and before the effects of foreign exchange 
core revenue growth excluding the effects of foreign exchange is referred to as core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange 
from time to time we have analyzed and we may continue to further analyze core revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange among two components  organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions 
we analyze organic core revenue growth and core revenue growth from acquisitions because management believes this information provides an important insight into the underlying health of our business 
core revenue includes the revenue from acquired businesses from the date of acquisition 
we evaluate the performance of our business segments based on segment revenue growth before the effects of foreign exchange  and segment operating income growth before certain types of gains and charges that we consider do not reflect our underlying business performance 
specifically  for management reporting purposes  we evaluate business segment performance before non core gains and charges because such charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations 
a recurring component of non core gains and charges are our restructuring charges  which result from a foundational element of our growth strategy that we refer to as financial flexibility 
through financial flexibility  management identifies opportunities to improve the performance of the business in terms of reallocating our spending from low growth or low value activities to activities that will create greater value for shareholders through enhanced revenue growth  improved profitability and or quality improvements 
management is committed through this process to examining our spending  and optimizing between variable and fixed costs to ensure flexibility in changes to our operating expense base as we make strategic choices 
this enables us to continually and systematically identify improvement opportunities in terms of quality  cost and customer experience 
such charges are variable from period to period based upon actions identified and taken during each period 
management reviews operating results before such non core gains and charges on a monthly basis and establishes internal budgets and forecasts based upon such measures 
management further establishes annual and long term compensation such as salaries  target cash bonuses and target equity compensation amounts based on performance before non core gains and charges and a significant percentage weight is placed upon performance before non core gains and charges in determining whether performance objectives have been achieved 
management believes that by eliminating non core gains and charges from such financial measures  and by being overt to shareholders about the results of our operations excluding such charges  business leaders are provided incentives to recommend and execute actions that are in the best long term interests of our shareholders  rather than being influenced by the potential impact a charge in a particular period could have on their compensation 
additionally  transition costs period costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary employees  relocation costs and stay bonuses incurred to implement the financial flexibility component of our strategy are reported as corporate and other expenses and are not allocated to our business segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for financial information regarding our segments 
similarly  when we evaluate the performance of our business as a whole  we focus on results such as operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate and diluted earnings per share before non core gains and charges because such non core gains and charges are not a component of our ongoing income or expenses and or may have a disproportionate positive or negative impact on the results of our ongoing underlying business operations and may drive behavior that does not ultimately maximize shareholder value 
it may be concluded from our presentation of non core gains and charges that the items that result in non core gains and charges may occur in the future 
we monitor free cash flow as a measure of our business 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities minus capital expenditures and additions to computer software and other intangibles 
free cash flow measures our available cash flow for potential debt repayment  acquisitions  stock repurchases  dividend payments and additions to cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
we believe free cash flow to be relevant and useful to our investors as this measure is used by our management in evaluating the funding available after supporting our ongoing business operations and our portfolio of product investments 
free cash flow should not be considered as a substitute measure for  or superior to  net cash flows provided by operating activities  investing activities or financing activities 
therefore  we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a complement to our consolidated statements of cash flows 
in addition  we evaluate our north america risk management solutions based on two metrics subscription  and non subscription  and dnbi and non dnbi 
we define subscription as contracts that allow customers unlimited use 
in these instances  we recognize revenue ratably over the term of the contract  which is generally one year and non subscription as all other revenue streams 
we define dnbi as our interactive  customizable online application that offers our customers real time access to our most complete and up to date global dunsright information  comprehensive monitoring and portfolio analysis and non dnbi as all other revenue streams 
management believes these measures provide further insight into our performance and growth of our north america risk management solutions revenue 
the adjustments discussed herein to our results as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods  to allocate resources  to evaluate business performance and  as noted above  for compensation purposes 
however  these financial measures eg  results before non core gains and charges and free cash flow are not prepared in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for total revenue  operating income  operating income growth  operating margin  net income  tax rate  diluted earnings per share  or net cash provided by operating activities  investing activities and financing activities prepared in accordance with gaap 
in addition  it should be noted that because not all companies calculate these financial measures similarly  or at all  the presentation of these financial measures is not likely to be comparable to measures of other companies 
see results of operations below for a discussion of our results reported on a gaap basis 
overview through december   we managed and reported our business globally through two segments north america which consisted of our operations in the united states us and canada  and international which consisted of our operations in europe  asia pacific and latin america 
the financial statements of our subsidiaries outside of north america reflect a fiscal year ended november to facilitate the timely reporting of our consolidated financial results and financial position 
however  as a result of our recent acquisition of dun bradstreet australia holdings limited d b australia  we began reporting our business as of january  through three segments north america which consists of our operations in the us and canada  asia pacific which primarily consists of our operations in australia  japan and china  and europe and other international markets which primarily consists of our operations in the united kingdom uk  the netherlands  belgium and latin america 
we will report financial results in this new segment structure beginning with the results for the first quarter of will and conform historical amounts to reflect the new segment structure

of those policies  we consider the policies described below to be critical because they are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require management s subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results in a given period ultimately differ from previous estimates  the actual results could have a material impact on such period 
we have discussed the selection and application of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure regarding critical accounting policies and estimates as well as the other sections in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
pension and postretirement benefit obligations through june   we offered to substantially all of our us based employees coverage under a defined benefit plan called the dun bradstreet corporation retirement account us qualified plan 
the defined benefit plan covered active and retired employees including retired individuals from spin off companies see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion of spin off companies 
the benefits to be paid upon retirement are based on a percentage of the employee s annual compensation 
the percentage of compensation allocated annually to a retirement account ranged from to based on age and service 
amounts allocated under the plan also receive interest credits based on the year treasury rate or equivalent rate published by the internal revenue service 
pension costs are determined actuarially and funded in accordance with the internal revenue code 
during in conjunction with a determination letter review  we updated certain portions of the plan s cash balance pay credit scale  along with the minimum interest crediting rate  retroactive to january   to ensure that the plan complies with the accrual rules in the internal revenue code 
we received a favorable determination letter for the plan in october in conjunction with these changes 
we also maintain supplemental and excess plans in the united states us non qualified plans to provide additional retirement benefits to certain key employees of the company 
these plans are unfunded  pay as you go plans 
the us qualified plan and the us non qualified plans account for approximately and of our pension obligation  respectively  at december  effective june   we amended the us qualified plan and one of the us non qualified plans  known as the us pension benefit equalization plan the pbep 
any pension benefit that had been accrued through such date under the two plans was frozen at its then current value and no additional benefits  other than interest on such amounts  will accrue under the us qualified plan and the pbep 
our employees in certain of our international operations are also provided with retirement benefits through defined benefit plans  representing the remaining balance of our pension obligations 
we also provide various health care for retirees 
us based employees  hired before january   who retire with years of vesting service after age  are eligible to receive benefits 
postretirement benefit costs and obligations are determined actuarially 
during the first quarter of  we eliminated company paid life insurance benefits for retirees and modified our sharing of the retiree drug subsidy with retirees that are projected to receive 
effective july   we elected to convert the current prescription drug program for retirees over to a group based company sponsored medicare part d program  or employer group waiver plan egwp 
under this change  beginning in  we will use the part d subsidies delivered through the egwp each year to reduce net company retiree medical costs until net company costs are completely eliminated 
at that time  the part d subsidies will be shared with retirees going forward to reduce retiree contributions 
the key assumptions used in the measurement of the pension and postretirement obligations and net periodic pension and postretirement cost are expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets which is based on a target asset allocation as well as expected returns on asset categories of plan investments  discount rate which is used to measure the present value of pension plan obligations and postretirement health care obligations 
the discount rates are derived using a yield curve approach which matches projected plan benefit payment streams with bond portfolios  reflecting actual liability duration unique to our plans  rates of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates which are based on an evaluation of internal plans and external market indicators  and health care cost trends which are based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  though changes in these assumptions would affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
the factor with the most immediate impact on our consolidated financial statements is a change in the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets for the us qualified plan 
for  we will continue to use an expected long term rate of return of 
this assumption was in each of the years  and the assumption represents our best estimate of the expected long term future investment performance of the us qualified plan  after considering expectations for future capital market returns and the plan s asset allocation 
as of december  the us qualified plan was invested in publicly traded equity securities  invested in debt securities and invested in real estate investments 
every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the long term rate of return increases or reduces our annual operating income by approximately million by increasing or reducing our net periodic pension income 
changes in the discount rate  rate of compensation increase and cash balance accumulation conversion rates also have an effect on our annual operating income 
based on the factors noted above  the discount rate is adjusted at each remeasurement date while other assumptions are reviewed annually 
for our us plans  every one quarter percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate reduces or increases our pension cost by approximately million 
the discount rate used to determine pension cost for our us pension plans was  and for  and  respectively 
for  we decreased the discount rate to from for all our us pension plans 
differences between the assumptions stated above and actual experience could affect our pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise 
these gains and losses are aggregated and amortized generally over the average future service periods or life expectancy of plan participants to the extent that such gains or losses exceed a corridor 
the purpose of the corridor is to reduce the volatility caused by the difference between actual experience and the pension related assumptions noted above  on a plan by plan basis 
for all of our pension plans  total actuarial losses that have not been recognized in our pension costs as of december  and were million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us qualified plan  million and million  respectively  were attributable to the us non qualified plans  and the remainder was attributable to the non us pension plans 
see discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we expect to recognize a portion of such losses in our net periodic pension cost of approximately million  million and million  for the us qualified plan  us non qualified plans and non us plans  respectively  compared to million  million and million  respectively  in the higher amortization of actuarial loss in for the us qualified plan  which will be included in our pension cost in  is primarily due to a lower discount rate and higher unrecognized actuarial loss subject to amortization in for the us qualified plan related to the investment loss from differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could affect our net periodic pension cost 
for our pension plans  we recorded net pension periodic cost of million  million and net pension periodic income of million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a major component of the net pension periodic cost is the expected return on plan assets  which was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets was determined by multiplying the expected long term rate of return assumption by the market related value of plan assets 
the market related value of plan assets recognizes asset gains and losses over five years to reduce the effects of short term market fluctuations on net periodic cost 
for our pension plans we recorded i for the year ended december   a total investment gain of million which was comprised of a gain of million in our us qualified plan and a gain of million in our non us plans  ii for the year ended december   a total investment gain of million which was comprised of a gain of million in our us qualified plan and a gain of million in our non us plans  and iii for the year ended december   a total investment loss of million which was comprised of a loss of million in our us qualified plan and a loss of million in our non us plans 
at january   the market related value of plan assets of our us qualified plan and the non us plans was  million and million  respectively  compared with the fair value of its plan assets of  million and million  respectively 
changes in the funded status of our pension plans could result in fluctuation in our shareholders equity deficit 
we are required to recognize the funded status of our benefit plans as a liability or an asset  on a plan by plan basis with an offsetting adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  in our shareholders equity deficit  net of tax 
accordingly  the amounts recognized in equity represent unrecognized gains losses and prior service costs 
these unrecognized gains losses and prior service costs are amortized out of equity deficit based on an actuarial calculation each period 
gains losses and prior service costs that arise during the year are recognized as a component of other comprehensive income oci which is then reflected in aoci 
as a result  we recorded a net income of million and a net loss of million in oci  net of applicable tax  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of the loss in was primarily due to a tax adjustment recorded in associated with the enactment of health care and education reconciliation act and an improvement in funded status at december   due to better plan experience and impact from assumption changes 
funded status for our global pension plans was a deficit of million at december  compared to a deficit of million at december   driven by better plan experience and positive impact from assumption changes in our international plan  partially offset by the deterioration of the funded status for our us qualified plan due to less favorable actuarial experience in the funded status for our us qualified plan was a deficit of million at december  compared to a deficit of million at december  for information on pension and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements  please see future liquidity sources and uses of funds pension plan and postretirement benefit plan contribution requirements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k for more information regarding costs of  and assumptions for  our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs 
tax reserves  contingencies and litigation we establish reserves in connection with legal proceedings  claims and litigation when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of loss is reasonably estimable 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long periods of time 
estimating probable losses requires analyses of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments concerning potential actions by third parties and regulators 
in connection with tax proceedings  we utilize a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this is an inherently subjective and complex process  and actual results may differ from our estimates by material amounts 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the following four conditions are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the contract fee is fixed and determinable  delivery or performance has occurred  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that collectibility is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred until the earlier of when collectibility becomes probable or the receipt of payment 
if there is uncertainty as to the customer s acceptance of our deliverables  revenue is not recognized until the earlier of receipt of customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
if at the outset of an arrangement  we determine that the arrangement fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is deferred until the arrangement fee becomes estimable  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
our risk management solutions are generally sold under fixed price subscription contracts that allow customers unlimited access to risk information 
revenue on this type of contract is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is generally one year 
risk information is also sold using monthly or annual contracts that allow customers to purchase our risk information up to the contract amount based on an agreed price list 
once the contract amount is fully used  additional risk information can be purchased at per item prices which may be different than those in the original contract 
revenue on these contracts is recognized on a per item basis as information is purchased and delivered to the customer 
if customers do not use the full amount of their contract and forfeit the unused portion  we recognize the forfeited amount as revenue at contract expiration 
where a data file of risk information is sold with periodic updates to that information  a portion of the revenue related to the updates is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered  usually on a quarterly or monthly basis over the term of the contract 
revenue related to services  such as monitoring  is recognized ratably over the period of performance 
sales marketing solutions that provide continuous access to our marketing information and business reference databases may include access or hosting fees which are sold on a subscription basis 
revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically one year 
where a data file of marketing information is sold  we recognize revenue upon delivery of the marketing data file to the customer 
if the contract provides for periodic updates to that marketing data file  the portion of the revenue related to updates is deferred as a liability on the balance sheet and recognized as the updates are delivered  usually on a quarterly or monthly basis  over the term of the contract 
internet solutions represent the results of our hoover s business  including both the first research division and the allbusiness 
com division 
hoover s and first research provide subscription solutions that allow continuous access to our business information databases

any additional solutions purchased are recognized upon delivery to the customer 
allbusiness 
com provides online media and e commerce products that provide advertisers the ability to target small business customers 
revenue is recognized as solutions are delivered to the customer over the contract period 
sales of software that are considered to be more than incidental are recognized in revenue when a non cancelable license agreement has been signed and the software has been shipped and installed  if required 
revenue from consulting and training services is recognized as the services are performed 
we have certain solution offerings that are sold as multi element arrangements 
the multiple elements or deliverables may include access to our business information databases  information data files  updates  software and services 
to account for each deliverable as a separate unit of accounting  they each must meet all of the following separation criteria the delivered item s has value to the customer on a stand alone basis  there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered item s  and if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the undelivered item s  delivery or performance of the undelivered item s is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if the deliverable or a group of deliverables meets the separation criteria  the total arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting based on its relative fair value 
the amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a delivered unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another unit of accounting 
we obtain vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of a deliverable by monitoring the price at which we sell the deliverable on a standalone basis 
where we are unable to use vsoe  we may use the price at which we or a third party sell a similar product to similarly situated customers on a standalone basis 
if we do not have fair value for the delivered items  the contract fee is allocated to the undelivered items based on their fair values and the remaining residual amount  if any  is allocated to the delivered items 
after the arrangement consideration is allocated to each unit of accounting  we apply the appropriate revenue recognition method from those described above for each unit of accounting  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
all deliverables that do not meet the separation criteria are combined with an undelivered unit of accounting 
we generally recognize revenue for a combined unit of accounting based on the method most appropriate for the last delivered item 
deferred revenue consists of amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized on sales of our information solutions and generally relates to deferral of subscription revenue 
deferred revenue is included in current liabilities in the balance sheet and is subsequently recognized as revenue in accordance with our revenue recognition policies 
we record revenue on a net basis for those sales where we act as an agent or broker in the transaction

year ended december  operating expenses increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to december  the increase was primarily due to the following increased data acquisition costs and fulfillment costs primarily associated with the following acquisitions a d b australia which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of  b icc which we consolidated in the third quarter of  and our majority owned joint venture with roadway in china which we consolidated in the third quarter of  increased costs associated with our investments  including million for our strategic technology investment designed to strengthen our leading position in commercial data and improve our current technology platform to meet emerging needs of customers  impairment of certain intangible assets related to our purisma product  increased compensation costs  and the negative impact of foreign exchange  partially offset by lower expenses related to our divestiture of the domestic portion of our italian operations and our north american self awareness solution business  and our ongoing reengineering efforts 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  operating expenses increased by million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to december  the increase was primarily due to the following increased data acquisition costs and fulfillment costs primarily associated with a our majority owned joint ventures in i d b india which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of  ii hc international  inc in china which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of  iii roadway in china which we consolidated in the third quarter of  and iv tokyo shoko research d b japan joint venture which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of  and b our acquisition of icc which we consolidated in the third quarter of  and increased costs associated with our investments  partially offset by the positive impact of foreign exchange  and lower costs as a result of our ongoing reengineering efforts and decreased variable expenses eg  professional fees and travel related expenses 
selling and administrative expenses year ended december  vs 
year ended december  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to december  the decrease was primarily due to the following lower expenses related to our divestiture of our north american self awareness solution business and the domestic portion of our italian operations  and our ongoing reengineering efforts  partially offset by increased selling expenses primarily associated with the following acquisitions a d b australia which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of  b icc which we consolidated in the third quarter of  and our majority owned joint venture with roadway in china which we consolidated in the third quarter of  increased costs due to our product investments  including million for our strategic technology investment designed to strengthen our leading position in commercial data and improve our current technology platform to meet emerging needs of customers  impairment of certain intangible assets related to our qed acquisition completed in the first quarter of  and the negative impact of foreign exchange 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to december  the decrease was primarily due to the following lower costs as a result of our ongoing reengineering efforts eg  our go to market approach for our north american sales organization and decreased variable expenses eg  commissions and bonuses  professional fees  and travel related expenses  and the positive impact of foreign exchange  partially offset by increased selling expenses primarily associated with a our majority owned joint ventures in i d b india which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of  ii hc international  inc in china which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of  iii roadway in china which we consolidated in the third quarter of  and iv tokyo shoko research d b japan joint venture which we consolidated in the fourth quarter of  and b the following acquisitions i icc which we consolidated in the third quarter of  and ii qed which we consolidated in the first quarter matters impacting both operating expenses and selling and administrative expenses pension  postretirement and k plan for our pension plans globally  we had a net pension periodic cost of million  million and net pension periodic income of million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the fluctuation in the pension cost income was due to the following the discount rates applied to the pension plans were major factors in driving the pension costs to fluctuate from year to year 
the lower the discount rate  the higher the pension cost 
the discount rate used to measure the pension costs for our us plans for the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense was also a major factor in driving the pension costs to fluctuate from year to year 
actuarial loss amortization was largely impacted by the discount rate  amortization period and plan experience 
the lower the discount rate  the higher the loss amortization 
actuarial loss amortization included in annual pension expense for all global plans was million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  of which million  million and million were attributable to our us plans for the years ended december   and  respectively 
lower actuarial loss amortization in the us plans was primarily driven by a longer amortization period applied to the us qualified plan  substantially offset by the impact of lower discount rates applied to our plans at january  and higher actuarial losses subject to amortization 
starting in november  the amortization period applied to the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses for our us qualified plan has been changed from average future service years of active participants to average life expectancy of all plan participants 
the change was the result of almost all the plan participants being deemed inactive 
pension income in was primarily due to the higher discount rate applied to our us plans and the major international plans  as well as lower actuarial loss amortization included in we expect that the net pension cost in will be approximately million for all of our global pension plans  of which approximately million will be attributable to each of the us plans and us plans 
this compares to a net pension cost of million in  which included pension income of million and pension cost of million attributable to the us plans and us plans  respectively 
for our us plans  lower expected return from plan assets resulting from lower market related value of plan assets will increase our net pension cost 
higher actuarial losses amortization will be substantially offset by lower interest cost  both driven by a lower discount rate 
the discount rate applied to our us plans at january   is basis points lower than lower pension cost in for our international plan is primarily due to a statutory change in the inflation assumption which results in lower interest cost and lower actuarial loss amortization 
we had postretirement benefit income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
higher income in was primarily due to higher amortization of prior service credits 
during the first quarter of  the retiree company paid life insurance benefits were eliminated 
in addition  we will only share the minimum necessary amount of subsidy received from the government in any year to maintain actuarial equivalence for as long as possible 
this plan change was approved in december and as a result we reduced our accumulated postretirement obligation by approximately million at december   which will be amortized over approximately four years 
effective july   in connection with the health care and education reconciliation act of  we converted the current prescription drug program for retirees over to a group based company sponsored medicare part d program  or egwp 
beginning in  we will use the part d subsidies delivered through the egwp each year to reduce net company retiree medical costs until net company costs are completely eliminated 
at that time  the part d subsidies will be shared with retirees going forward to reduce retiree contributions 
as a result  we reduced our accumulated postretirement obligation by million in the third quarter of  which will be amortized over approximately four years 
both plan changes were accounted for as plan amendments under asc  compensation retirement benefits 
lower postretirement benefit income in was primarily due to full amortization of the prior service credit 
this prior service credit was related to the plan amendment to limit our insurance premium contribution 
higher postretirement benefit income in was primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial gain  which was driven by positive plan experience and changes in assumptions 
we expect postretirement benefit income will be approximately million in the increase in income from to is primarily due to higher amortization of prior service credits as explained above 
we had expense associated with our k plan of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in expense in was due to an incremental discretionary company contribution of million resulting from company performance 
in addition  we amended our employer matching provision in the k plan  effective in april  to increase the employer maximum match from of three percent to of seven percent of a team member s eligible compensation  subject to certain k plan limitations 
the decrease in expense in was due to the amendment of our employer matching provision in the k plan effective in february   to decrease our match formula from to of a team member s contributions and to decrease the maximum match from seven percent to three percent of such team member s eligible compensation  subject to certain k plan limitations 
we consider net pension cost and postretirement benefit income to be part of our compensation costs  and  therefore  they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses  based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs 
see the discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates pension and postretirement benefit obligations  above  and note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
stock based compensation for the years ended december   and  we recognized total stock based compensation expense eg  stock options  restricted stock  etc 
of million  million and million  respectively 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized expense associated with our stock option programs of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to december   was primarily due to higher forfeitures  partially offset by the accelerated expensing of an award issued to a retiree eligible senior executive 
the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to  was primarily due to a decrease in the overall number of employees eligible for stock options 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized expense associated with our restricted stock  restricted stock units and restricted stock opportunity programs of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to december   was primarily due to higher forfeitures associated with terminated employees as well as fewer awards being issued in as compared to the same period in  partially offset by the accelerated expensing of an award issued to a retiree eligible senior executive 
the decrease for the year ended december  as compared to december   was primarily driven by performance based awards being below target  resulting in lower expense 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized expense associated with our employee stock purchase plan espp of million  million and million  respectively 
we consider these costs to be part of our compensation costs and  therefore  they are included in operating expenses and in selling and administrative expenses  based upon the classifications of the underlying compensation costs 
depreciation and amortization year ended december  vs 
year ended december  depreciation and amortization increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to december  the increase for the year ended december  was primarily driven by an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions and our majority owned joint ventures  increased capital costs for revenue generating investments to enhance our strategic capabilities and our strategic technology investment 
this increase was partially offset by a reassessment in of the useful lives of our computer software discussed in further detail below 
year ended december  vs 
year ended december  depreciation and amortization decreased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to december  the decrease for the year ended december  was primarily driven by a reassessment of the useful lives of our computer software 
we review the estimated remaining useful lives of our computer software and may extend the useful life when events and circumstances indicate the computer software can operate beyond its original or current useful life 
prior to the second quarter of  the useful life of computer software assets was typically three to five years 
we now expect the useful life of our back end and back office software to be in the range of five to eight years  and we have extended the useful lives accordingly 
this reassessment included a review of the major components of our strategy and consideration of the effects of obsolescence  technology  competition and other economic factors on the useful life of these assets 
the impact of this change was effective in the second quarter of  and the impact for the year ended december  was a reduction in software amortization expense by approximately million after tax per diluted share 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions and our majority owned joint ventures and increased capital costs for revenue generating investments to enhance our strategic capabilities 
restructuring charge financial flexibility is an ongoing process by which we seek to reallocate our spending from low growth or low value activities to other activities that will create greater value for shareholders through enhanced revenue growth  improved profitability and or quality improvements 
with most initiatives  we have incurred restructuring charges which generally consist of employee severance and termination costs  contract terminations  asset write offs  and or costs to terminate lease obligations less assumed sublease income 
these charges are incurred as a result of eliminating  consolidating  standardizing and or automating our business functions 
we have also incurred transition costs such as consulting fees  costs of temporary workers  relocation costs and stay bonuses to implement our financial flexibility initiatives 
restructuring charges have been recorded in accordance with asc  nonretirement postemployment benefits  or asc  and or asc  exit or disposal cost obligations  or asc  as appropriate 
we record severance costs provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement once they are both probable and estimable in accordance with the provisions of asc we account for one time termination benefits  contract terminations  asset write offs  and or costs to terminate lease obligations less assumed sublease income in accordance with asc  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with restructuring activities 
under asc  we establish a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity  including severance and lease termination obligations  and other related costs  when the liability is incurred  rather than at the date that we commit to an exit plan 
we reassess the expected cost to complete the exit or disposal activities at the end of each reporting period and adjust our remaining estimated liabilities  if necessary 
the determination of when we accrue for severance costs and which standard applies depends on whether the termination benefits are provided under an ongoing arrangement as described in asc or under a one time benefit arrangement as defined by asc inherent in the estimation of the costs related to the restructurings are assessments related to the most likely expected outcome of the significant actions to accomplish the exit activities 
in determining the charges related to the restructurings  we had to make estimates related to the expenses associated with the restructurings 
these estimates may vary significantly from actual costs depending  in part  upon factors that may be beyond our control 
we will continue to review the status of our restructuring obligations on a quarterly basis and  if appropriate  record changes to these obligations in current operations based on management s most current estimates 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million restructuring charge in connection with financial flexibility initiatives 
the significant components of these charges included severance and termination costs of million in accordance with the provisions of asc were recorded 
approximately employees were impacted

we have recorded the resulting gain of million both pre tax and after tax from the sale in the first quarter of in the consolidated statement of operations 
earnings per share in accordance with authoritative guidance in asc  we are required to assess if any of our share based payment transactions are deemed participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation when computing eps under the two class method 
the two class method requires earnings to be allocated between common shareholders and holders of participating securities 
all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends are considered to be a separate class of common stock and should be included in the calculation of basic and diluted eps 
based on a review of our stock based awards  we have determined that only our restricted stock awards are deemed participating securities 
we adopted the authoritative guidance regarding share based payments effective january  the impact of the adoption resulted in a four cent and two cent decrease to our basic and diluted eps for the year ended december  the weighted average restricted shares outstanding was  shares   shares and  shares for the years ended december   and  respectively

for the year ended december   both basic eps attributable to d b common shareholders and diluted eps attributable to d b common shareholders increased compared with the year ended december   primarily due to a increase in net income attributable to d b and a reduction in the weighted average number of basic shares outstanding resulting from our total share repurchases

excluding the impact of the divestiture  core revenue decreased million  or both before and after the effect of foreign exchange 
north america customer solution sets on a customer solution set basis  the million decrease in core revenue for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   reflects risk management solutions a decrease in risk management solutions of million  or both before and after the effect of foreign exchange 
for the year ended december   traditional risk management solutions  which accounted for of total north america risk management solutions  decreased decrease before the effect of foreign exchange 
the decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of credit origination resulting in lower transactional volumes as well as a lower demand in earlier periods for our ratable subscription products  partially offset by year over year growth in our subscription plans for dnbi throughout due to continued high retention and increased dollar spend per customer resulting from an increased emphasis on our value proposition  and higher purchases from our existing customers as they converted from our legacy products to subscription plans for dnbi  including the customers who previously purchased value added solutions 
these subscription plans provide our customers with unlimited use of our risk management reports and data 
we continue to see single digit price increases when existing customers renew these subscription plans and double digit price increases when customers convert to dnbi 
however  with more than half of our risk management solutions revenue derived from dnbi  we have a far smaller base available for conversion in the future 
for the year ended december   value added risk management solutions  which accounted for of total north america risk management solutions  remained flat compared to prior year 
this was primarily due to the impact of lower volumes of credit origination due to the macroeconomic environment has translated into lower transactional volumes as well as a lower demand in earlier periods for our ratable subscription products as noted above  and a shift in product mix to our dnbi subscriptions plans from our value added risk management solutions to our traditional risk management solutions as noted above  offset by higher purchases from existing customers of modules enabled by our dnbi platform which are included in our value added risk management solutions  and increased sales to existing customers of value added credit decisioning solutions

for the year ended december   traditional sales marketing solutions  which accounted for of total north america sales marketing solutions  decreased both before and after the effect of foreign exchange 
the decrease was primarily due to lower purchases from our customers due to a weak economy and budgetary pressures 
these budgetary pressures have caused our customers to further focus their marketing efforts and  in some cases  shift from direct mail activities to digital marketing to reduce costs  partially offset by increased revenue to existing customers in our education marketing solutions business  and increased revenue associated with our acquisition of qed completed in the first quarter of  which contributed one point of the growth 
for the year ended december   value added sales marketing solutions  which accounted for of total north america sales marketing solutions  increased both before and after the effect of foreign exchange 
the increase was primarily due to increased cross selling of our sales marketing solutions value added solutions into our customer base  and cross selling within the sales marketing solutions value added solutions customer base including the cross selling of new solutions for digital marketing  new customer acquisition and increased commitments within certain of our solutions  and a timing benefit from a significant customer consolidating the contractual expiration dates for multiple contracts  some of which would have renewed in future periods  partially offset by lower purchases of our value added products due to budgetary pressures on our customers 
in this environment customers are continuing to defer or decrease spend or not renew 
internet solutions a decrease in internet solutions of million  or both before and after the effect of foreign exchange  as a result of a decline in our subscription renewal sales and a loss of a large customer deal not renewing 
we expect the north american segment to perform better than and return to growth in specifically  we expect revenue growth for to be in the low single digits

market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes  foreign currency fluctuations and changes in the market value of certain of our investments 
we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and foreign currencies 
we use foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge short term foreign currency denominated loans  investments and certain third party and intercompany transactions 
we may use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge investments and reduce our international earnings exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  we may use interest rate derivatives to hedge a portion of the interest rate exposure on our outstanding debt or in anticipation of future debt issuance  as discussed under interest rate risk management below 
a discussion of our accounting policies for financial instruments is included in the summary of significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  and further disclosure relating to financial instruments is included in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
interest rate risk management fair value hedges for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  we assess quarterly whether the swaps are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged debt 
changes in fair values of interest rate swap agreements that are designated fair value hedges are recognized in earnings as an adjustment of other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operations 
the effectiveness of hedge accounting is monitored on an ongoing basis  and if considered ineffective  we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 
in november  we issued senior notes with a face value of million that mature on november  the notes 
in november and december  we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of million 
the objective of these hedges is to offset the change in fair value of the fixed rate notes attributable to changes in libor 
these transactions are accounted for as fair value hedges 
we will recognize the gain or loss on the derivative instrument  as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item  in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operations 
approximately million of derivative losses offset by a million gain on the fair value adjustment related to the hedged debt were recorded through december  cash flow hedges for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings 
in january and december  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of million and million  respectively  and designated these swaps as cash flow hedges against variability in cash flows related to our bank revolving credit facility 
these transactions are accounted for as cash flow hedges and  as such  changes in fair value of the hedges are recorded in aoci 
at december   the balance of net derivative losses associated with these swaps included in aoci was million 
in april  we issued senior notes with a face value of million that mature on april  the notes 
in january  we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of million 
the objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in treasury rates in the anticipation of the issuance of the notes 
these transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges and  as such  changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of debt issuance were recorded in aoci 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  these interest rate derivative transactions were terminated  resulting in a loss and a payment of million at the date of termination 
the payments are recorded in aoci  and will be amortized over the life of the notes 
in march  we issued senior notes with a face value of million that matured on march  the notes 
in february and september  we entered into interest rate derivative transactions with aggregate notional amounts of million and million  respectively 
the objective of these hedges was to mitigate the variability of future cash flows from market changes in treasury rates in the anticipation of the notes 
these transactions were accounted for as cash flow hedges  and as such  changes in fair value of the hedges that took place through the date of debt issuance were recorded in aoci 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  these interest rate derivative transactions were terminated  resulting in a gain and a receipt of million at the date of termination 
as a result of the redemption of the notes  the unamortized balance related to these interest rate derivative transactions was written off in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  at december   we had a million bank revolving credit facility available at prevailing short term interest rates  which we terminated on april   and then entered into a new million  five year bank revolving credit facility  which expires in april on january   we exercised a million expansion feature on our million credit facility expanding the total facility to million 
borrowings under the million credit facility are available at prevailing short term interest rates 
at december  and december   we had million and million of debt outstanding under the facility  respectively 
a basis point increase decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding debt subject to rate variability at december   would result in an incremental increase decrease in annual interest expense of approximately million 
foreign exchange risk management we have numerous offices in various countries outside north america and conduct operations in various countries through minority equity investments and strategic relationships with local providers 
our international operations generated approximately and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
approximately and of our assets as of december  and  respectively  were located outside of the us our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to reduce the volatility caused by foreign exchange rate changes on the earnings  cash flows and financial position of our international operations 
we follow a policy of hedging balance sheet positions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries 
in addition  we are subject to foreign exchange risk associated with our international earnings and investments 
we use short term  foreign exchange forward and option contracts to implement our hedging strategies 
these contracts have maturities of twelve months or less 
these contracts are denominated primarily in the british pound sterling  the euro and canadian dollar 
the gains and losses on the forward contracts associated with the balance sheet positions hedge are recorded in other income expense net in our consolidated statement of operations and are essentially offset by the gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency transactions 
as in prior years  we have hedged substantially all balance sheet positions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency applicable to each of our various subsidiaries with short term forward foreign exchange contracts 
in addition  we may use foreign exchange option contracts to hedge certain foreign earnings and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain net investment positions 
the underlying transactions and the corresponding forward exchange and option contracts are marked to market at the end of each quarter and are reflected within our consolidated financial statements 
at december   there were million in option contracts outstanding 
at december   we did not have any option contracts outstanding 
at december  and  we had a notional amount of approximately million and million  respectively  of foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding that offset foreign currency denominated loans 
realized gains and losses associated with these contracts were million and million  respectively  at december   million and million  respectively  at december   and million and million  respectively  at december  unrealized gains and losses associated with these contracts were million and million  respectively  at december   million and million  respectively  at december   and million and million  respectively  at december  if exchange rates were to increase on average from year end levels  the unrealized loss on our foreign exchange forward contracts would be approximately million  excluding the expected gain on the underlying hedged item 
if exchange rates on average were to decrease from year end levels  the unrealized gain on our foreign exchange forward contracts would be approximately million  excluding the expected loss on the underlying hedge item 
however  the estimated potential gain and loss on these contracts is expected to be substantially offset by changes in the dollar value of the underlying transactions 
liquidity and financial position in connection with our focus on delivering total shareholder return  we will remain disciplined in the use of our shareholders cash  maintaining three key priorities for the use of this cash first  making ongoing investments in the business to drive growth  second  investing in acquisitions that we believe will be value accretive to enhance our capabilities and accelerate our growth  and third  continuing to return cash to shareholders 
we believe that cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as needed with available financing arrangements  is sufficient to meet our short term needs twelve months or less  including restructuring charges  transition costs  our strategic technology investment  contractual obligations and contingencies see note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k  excluding the legal matters identified in such note for which exposures cannot be estimated or are not probable 
in addition  we believe that our ability to readily access the bank and capital markets for incremental financing needs will enable us to meet our continued focus on total shareholder return 
we have the ability to access the short term borrowings market from time to time to fund working capital needs  acquisitions and share repurchases 
such borrowings would be supported by our credit facility  when needed 
the disruption in the economic environment has had a significant adverse impact on a number of commercial and financial institutions 
our liquidity has not been impacted by the current credit environment and management does not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future 
management continues to closely monitor our liquidity  the credit markets and our financial counterparties 
however  management cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment
