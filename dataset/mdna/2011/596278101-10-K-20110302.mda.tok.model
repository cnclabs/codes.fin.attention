critical accounting policies and estimates management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as related disclosures 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates and judgments based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on the sale of its products when risk of loss has passed to the customer  which occurs at the time of shipment  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the sale prices of the products sold are fixed and determinable at the time of shipment 
sales are reported net of sales returns  sales incentives and cash discounts based on prior experience and other quantitative and qualitative factors 
at the food processing equipment group  the company enters into long term sales contracts for certain products 
revenue under these long term sales contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method defined within asc construction type and production type contracts due to the length of time to fully manufacture and assemble the equipment 
the company measures revenue recognized based on the ratio of actual labor hours incurred in relation to the total estimated labor hours to be incurred related to the contract 
because estimated labor hours to complete a project are based upon forecasts using the best available information  the actual hours may differ from original estimates 
the percentage of completion method of accounting for these contracts most accurately reflects the status of these uncompleted contracts in the company financial statements and most accurately measures the matching of revenues with expenses 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the amount of the estimated loss is recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives based on management estimates of the period over which the assets will be utilized to benefit the operations of the company 
the useful lives are estimated based on historical experience with similar assets  taking into account anticipated technological or other changes 
the company periodically reviews these lives relative to physical factors  economic factors and industry trends 
if there are changes in the planned use of property and equipment or if technological changes were to occur more rapidly than anticipated  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation and amortization expense in future periods 
long lived assets 
long lived assets including goodwill and other intangibles are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of the company long lived assets  the company considers changes in economic conditions and makes assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
estimates of future cash flows are judgments based on the company experience and knowledge of operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by many factors including changes in global and local business and economic conditions  operating costs  inflation  competition  and consumer and demographic trends 
if the company estimates or the underlying assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges 
warranty 
in the normal course of business the company issues product warranties for specific product lines and provides for the estimated future warranty cost in the period in which the sale is recorded 
the estimate of warranty cost is based on contract terms and historical warranty loss experience that is periodically adjusted for recent actual experience 
because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information  claims costs may differ from amounts provided 
adjustments to initial obligations for warranties are made as changes in the obligations become reasonably estimable 
litigation 
from time to time  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to products  suppliers  employees  customers and competitors 
the company maintains insurance to partially cover product liability  workers compensation  property and casualty and general liability matters 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accrual required  if any  for these contingencies is made after assessment of each matter and the related insurance coverage 
the reserve requirements may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
the company does not believe that any pending litigation will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes 
the company operates in numerous foreign and domestic taxing jurisdictions where it is subject to various types of tax  including sales tax and income tax 
the company tax filings are subject to audits and adjustments 
because of the nature of the company s operations  the nature of the audit items can be complex and the objectives of the government auditors can result in a tax on the same transaction or income in more than one state or country 
as part of the company calculation of the provision for taxes  the company establishes reserves for the amount that it expects to incur as a result of audits 
the reserves may change in the future due to new developments related to the various tax matters
