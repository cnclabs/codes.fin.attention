industry wide factors that are relevant to our business the transportation information industry in china is in the process of rapid and continuous development 
we believe that the trend in china s transportation information industry is toward a continuous increase of the chinese government s and public s demand for advanced transportation information products and services to support more effective and efficient transportation networks in china 
one result of this trend is the growing amount of governmental spending in the sector of transportation 
we believe that further development of china s highway and urban transportation infrastructure will impact favorably on the demand for our transportation information products and services

we believe that the industry growth will continue to impact favorably on our business growth in the future 
one main factor that management considers when estimating our future growth is the potential revenue from larger government projects in the transportation sector of the chinese government based on annual budget reports issued by relevant governmental sectors at both central and local levels 
we expect that these potential new projects will generate revenues from new transportation information product sales and services

however  on march   the national people s congress of china passed the new enterprise income tax law eit law  and on november   the state council of china passed the implementing rules for the eit law implementing rules  which took effect on january  the eit law and implementing rules impose a unified eit of on all domestic invested enterprises and fies  unless they qualify under certain limited exceptions 
therefore  nearly all fies are subject to the new tax rate alongside other domestic businesses rather than benefiting from the feit  and its associated preferential tax treatments  beginning january  in addition to the changes to the current tax structure  under the eit law  an enterprise established outside of china with de facto management bodies within china is considered a resident enterprise and will normally be subject to an eit of on its global income 
the implementing rules define the term de facto management bodies as an establishment that exercises  in substance  overall management and control over the production  business  personnel  accounting  etc  of a chinese enterprise

as a result  transportation products and solutions have continued to comprise an increasingly larger portion of our revenue throughout the year

cost of sales 
our cost of goods sold increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million in this increase was mainly due to the increase in the costs in line with the increase in our sales 
as a percentage of revenues  the cost of sales increased to during the year ended december  from in the increase of our cost of sales as a percentage of revenue was mainly attributable to the fact that we have expanded into more its markets through unisits and resulted in a relatively lower gross margin on average than that of the company s in the following table illustrates in detail the items constituting our costs of goods sold 
years ended december  cost item salary   hardware   software licenses   outsourcing   others   total   gross profit 
our gross profit increased approximately million  or  to approximately million for the year ended december   from approximately million in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was for the year ended december   a decrease of from in our gross profit decrease was mainly attributable to the fact that we have expanded into more its markets through unisits and resulted in a relatively lower margin on average than that of the company s in selling  general and administrative expenses 
majority of our services and products are sold to the domestic chinese market through contracts commissioned by the chinese government 
various government entities and agencies either invite us to bid for a specific contract or award a contract to us on a non bid basis 
we are often invited to bid on contracts through our professional relationships and are awarded recurring businesses 
historically  we did not incur high cost in our sales and marketing activities 
we promoted our products by developing relationships through peking university  professional relationships with various agencies and municipalities and through participation in industry trade exhibitions 
our marketing expenses therefore were relatively low in comparison to our competitors who do not have a record of performance and brand recognition or well established government contacts 
in  we have enhanced our marketing efforts by organizing various industry trade exhibitions and conferences in order to further promote our corporate image and brand recognition within the transportation information industry in china 
our selling expenses including sales representative commissions  promotion fees and marketing expenses  increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the increase of selling expenses was mainly attributable to our expanded operations and sales volume as well as the enhanced marketing activities for the year ended december  our general and administrative expenses were approximately million of total sales and approximately million of total sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of administrative expenses was mainly attributable to our expanded operations  the increase of employees  and enhanced research and development efforts

for the year ended december   we recognized income tax expense of million and effective tax rate of while in  we recognized an income tax expense of million at an effective tax rate of 
the increase in the income tax expense is mainly resulted from our increased sales and profit  as well as the inclusion of unisits result for the whole year of some of our operating vie entities in china enjoy tax breaks from the local government to promote high technology and new technology businesses within a promotional periods 
unisits s effective tax rate in was and for liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents excluding restricted cash of approximately million and restricted cash of approximately million 
the following table provides detailed information about our net cash flow for all financial statements periods presented in this report 
cash flow years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities   net cash provided by used in investing activities  net cash provided by financing activities   net cash inflow   operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million in fiscal year ended december   which was a decrease of approximately million from approximately million net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year ended december  such decrease of net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the increase in accounts receivables as a result of the increase in our sales in  the increase of prepaid expenses in as a result of more material procurement for projects  offset by an increase in net profit in  increase in accounts payable in as a result of our expanded operations which required more material procurement for projects  increase in net billings in  that is  the difference between the billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted projects when we receive payments from clients ahead of cost and earnings realization and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of uncompleted projects when our work was performed ahead of customer payments in some of our contracts per the contract payment terms 
investing activities our main uses of cash for investing activities are payments relating to the acquisitions of property and equipment  such as machinery and equipment  transportation equipment for company operation  and intangible assets for further research and development 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million in fiscal year  a decrease of million from the million net cash provided by investing activities in fiscal year such decrease of net cash provided by investing activities was primarily attributable to the acquisition of unisits which contributed a one time net cash increase of million to the company in financing activities net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended december  was approximately million  while in the same period of we had approximately million of net cash provided by financing activities 
such change was mainly attributable to the facts that we raised million in the private placement transaction in february and the company increased short term borrowing by about million in financing agreements on june   we entered into a short term loan agreement with beijing bank  youyi branch youyi branch  pursuant to which youyi branch has agreed to loan to us rmb million approximately million for working capital purposes

interest is payable on a monthly basis commencing october  the term of the loan was extended on september  for six more months 
under the terms of the loan agreement  we are subject to customary affirmative and negative covenants 
the loan may be accelerated and huaxia bank may demand immediate payment of the principal and accrued interests upon the occurrence of an event of default which includes  among other things  a failure to make principal or interest payments  a failure to comply with other covenants and certain events of bankruptcy

as of december   principal amount of approximately million was outstanding 
future capital requirements we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs  including our cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we may  however  require additional cash due to changing business conditions or other future developments  including any investments or acquisitions we may decide to pursue 
in addition  because substantially all of our revenues are generated from our indirect prc subsidiary  oriental intra asia  after it receives payments from our vie entities under various services and other arrangements  the ability of oriental intra asia to make dividends and other payments to us is subject to the prc dividend restrictions 
current prc law permits payments of dividend by oriental intra asia only out of its accumulated after tax profits  if any  determined in accordance with prc accounting standards and regulations 
oriental intra asia is also required under prc laws and regulations to allocate at least of its annual after tax profits determined in accordance with prc gaap to a statutory general reserve fund until the amounts in said fund reaches of oriental intra asia s registered capital 
allocations to the statutory reserve fund can only be used for specific purposes and are not transferable to us in the form of loans  advances or cash dividends 
as a result  if our existing cash and amount available under existing bank loans insufficient to meet our requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity securities  debt securities or borrow additional funds from lending institutions 
we can make no assurances that financing will be available in the amounts we need or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
the sale of additional equity securities  including convertible debt securities  would dilute the interests of our current shareholders 
the incurrence of debt would divert cash for working capital and capital expenditures to service debt obligations and could result in operating and financial covenants that restrict our operations and our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing as required  our business operations and prospects may suffer 
as of december  and  our working capital was  and  respectively 
contractual obligation and capital commitments we have entered into a lease agreement to lease office spaces at the th and th floors of vision building  no 
xueyuanlu  haidian district  beijing china

we are entitled for one free month rental of rmb  approximately  per year 
this lease expires on october  we expect that we will be able to renew the lease on similar terms prior to its expiration 
unisits  one of the company s vie entities  has also entered a lease agreement to lease office spaces at the th floor of vision building 
pursuant to this lease  unisits has the right to use the office space of  square meters in the vision building from february  unisits pays a monthly rent including a monthly property management fee of rmb  of rmb  approximately  for this facility 
unisits is entitled to a two month free rental of rmb  approximately  for the first two months 
this lease expires on february  the aggregate future minimum payments under these lease agreements over one year are as follows less than year years long term debt  including current portion  operating leases  total   effects of inflation inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business and we do not expect that inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future 
however  our management will closely monitor the price change and continually maintain effective cost control in operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity or capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to an investor in our securities 
seasonality our results of operations are affected by seasonality and we typically see lower sales during the first half than the second half of a year 
such seasonality is mainly caused by governmental seasonal budgeting activities and behaviors 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements  including the notes thereto  and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies  if any 
we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements  including the following principles of consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company  its wholly owned subsidiaries oriental intra asia entertainment asia pacific limited  intra asia entertainment china limited and cabowise  its indirectly owned subsidiaries oriental intra asia  and the company s variable interest entities  or the vie entities  including the group company  pku  beijing tian hao  beijing zhangcheng  xinjiang zhangcheng  zhangcheng media  china tranwiseway  hunan tranwiseway  hebei tranwiseway  guizhou tranwiseway  dajian zhitong  shanghai yootu  unisits  hangzhou ziguang jietong technology co  ltd  hangzhou unisits  henan ziguang jietong technology co  ltd

significant estimates include accrued warranty costs  as well as revenue and costs recorded under the percentage of completion method 
actual results could materially differ from those estimates 
segment information asc requires companies to report information about operating segment in interim and annual financial statements 
it also requires segment disclosures about products and services geographic and major customers 
the company has determined that it does not have any separately reportable operating segments 
cash equivalents the company classifies all highly liquid investments purchased with a maturity of three months or less as cash equivalents 
accounts receivable accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a review of all outstanding amounts at year end 
management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts 
trade receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
long term investment the company classifies its investments as available for sale in accordance with asc debt and equity securities  investments debt and equity securities  and are reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses as a result of changes in the fair value of the available for sale investments are recorded as a separate component within accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company uses the cost method of accounting for investments in companies that do not have a readily determinable fair value in which it holds an interest of less than and over which it does not have the ability to exercise significant influence 
for entities in which the company holds an interest of greater than or in which the company does have the ability to exercise significant influence  the company uses the equity method 
the company s investments also include privately held companies where quoted market prices are not available and as a result  the cost method  combined with other intrinsic information  is used to assess the fair value of the investment 
if the carrying value is below the fair value of an investment at the end of any period  the investment is considered for impairment 
investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is provided for using straight line methods over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
amortization of leasehold improvements is over the lesser of the lease term or useful life of the improvement 
useful lives years automobiles machinery and equipments furniture and fixtures amortization of intangible assets intangible assets primarily include the costs of capitalized r d costs  costs for purchased intangibles and intangibles result from acquisitions 
purchased intangible costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which approximate years 
intangible assets result from acquisitions and include developed technology  customer related intangibles  trade names and other identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 
with the exception of developed technology  these intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method 
developed technology is amortized over the greater of the amount calculated using the ratio of current quarter revenues to the total of current quarter and anticipated future revenues over the estimated useful life of the developed technology  and the straight line method over each developed technology s remaining useful life 
amortization of developed technology is recorded within cost of revenues 
amortization of customer related intangibles  trade names and other identifiable intangible assets is recorded within operating expenses 
intangible asset capitalized for the years ended and  the intangible asset capitalized but not yet amortized were  and  respectively 
purchased assets from third parties for further research and development the company purchased software from third parties for further research and development for total cash consideration of  and  for the years ended and  respectively

the company performs its annual impairment test as of the last day of the fiscal year 
these impairment tests must be performed more frequently if there are triggering events 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with asc  revenue recognition  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered 
the company s revenue of service fees are primarily fixed price contracts 
revenue on eligible fixed price contracts is recognized on the basis of the estimated percentage of completion within the scope of asc and is consistently applied for all fixed price contracts 
such contracts include services provided for software development projects  it outsourcing and solutions  system integration  and network integration services at fixed price arrangements with its customers 
progress towards completion is typically measured based on achievement of specified contract milestones  or other measures of progress when available  or based on costs incurred as a proportion of estimated total costs 
profit in a given period is reported at the expected profit margin to be achieved on the overall contract 
this method can result in the recognition of unbilled receivables or the deferral of costs or profit on these contracts 
the company did not incur any deferred costs for the years ended december  and management regularly reviews project profitability and underlying estimates 
revisions to the estimates at completion are reflected in results of operations as a change in accounting estimate in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known by management 
provisions for estimated losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes evident 
the provision includes estimated costs in excess of estimated revenue and any profit margin previously recognized 
any advance payments received from its customers prior to recognition of revenue is classified as a current liability as billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on incompleted contracts 
for taxi media advertising revenue  the company recognizes deferred revenue when cash is received  but the revenue has not yet been earned 
the company recognizes taxi media advertising revenue ratably over the period in which the advertisement is to be published 
the company has very limited system maintenance and technology upgrade services for the systems platforms we have built for clients 
in most cases  such service revenue was secured on separate contracts basis 
such service revenues are recognized ratably over the service periods 
research and development research and development expenses include payroll  employee benefits  and other headcount related expenses associated with product development 
such costs related to product development costs are included in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached  which for the company products  is generally shortly before the products are released for the commercial use 
once technological feasibility is reached  such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated useful lives of the products 
as of december  and  research and development expenses were capitalized in the amount of  and  and were included in intangible assets in the company consolidated balance sheet 
stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic  compensation stock compensation formerly sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires the application of a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees 
during  we granted stock options as part of our key performer stock based compensation program 
during  we granted stock options as part of our key performer stock based compensation program  as well as stock options or restricted stock units to management and directors 
the vesting of stock option grants may be based on time  performance  market conditions  or a combination of performance and market conditions 
in the future  we may grant stock awards  options  or other equity based instruments allowed by our stock based compensation plans  or a combination thereof  as part of our overall compensation strategy 
the fair values of restricted stock awards with time based vesting  including restricted stock and restricted stock units  are generally based on the market price of the stock awards at the date of grant 
as permitted under asc topic  we generally use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on recent six to twelve months trailing implied volatility calculations 
these calculations are performed on exchange traded options of our common stock 
we believe that using a forward looking market driven volatility assumption will result in the best estimate of expected volatility 
the assumed risk free interest rate is the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
the assumed expected life is based on company specific historical experience 
with regard to the estimate of the expected life  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
we estimate forfeiture rates at the time awards are made based on historical and estimated future turnover rates and apply these rates in the calculation of estimated compensation cost 
the estimation of forfeiture rates includes a quarterly review of historical turnover rates and an update of the estimated forfeiture rates to be applied to employee classes for the calculation of stock based compensation 
during  forfeiture rates for the calculation of stock based compensation were estimated and applied based on three classes  non employee directors  executive management staff and other employees 
at december   our annualized estimated forfeiture rates were for non employee director awards and for both executive management staff and other employee awards 
then current estimated forfeiture rates are also applied quarterly to all outstanding stock options and non vested restricted stock awards  which may result in a revised estimate of compensation costs related to these stock based grants 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding stock based compensation 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with asc  income taxes  which requires that the company recognize deferred tax liabilities and assets based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates in effect in the years the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred income tax benefit expense results from the change in net deferred tax assets or deferred tax liabilities

 and updates the test between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
the company performs the annual review for goodwill impairments 
the annual test of the potential impairment of goodwill requires a two step process 
step one of the impairment test involves comparing the estimated fair values of reporting units with their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  step two must be performed to determine the amount  if any  of the goodwill impairment loss 
if the carrying amount is less than fair value  further testing of goodwill impairment is not performed 
step two of the goodwill impairment test involves comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill against the carrying value of the goodwill 
under step two  determining the implied fair value of goodwill requires the valuation of a reporting unit s identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination on the testing date 
the difference between the fair value of the entire reporting unit as determined in step one and the net fair value of all identifiable assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill 
the goodwill impairment charge  if any  would be the difference between the carrying amount of goodwill and the implied fair value of goodwill upon the completion of step two 
for purposes of the step one analyses  determination of reporting units fair value is typically based on the income approach  which estimates the fair value of the company s reporting units based on discounted future cash flows

impairment of long lived assets the company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with asc  property  plant and equipment 
the company periodically evaluates long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the estimated future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges from the use of an asset were less than the carrying value  a write down would be recorded to reduce the related asset to its estimated fair value 
the assumptions used by management in determining the future cash flows are critical 
in the event these expected cash flows are not realized  future impairment losses may be recorded 
management has determined that no impairments of long lived assets currently exist
