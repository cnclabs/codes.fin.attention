md a is provided as a supplement to and should be read in connection with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in item of this report 
md a includes the following sections our business a general description of our business and key events 
consolidated review of operations an analysis of our consolidated results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements 
operating segment review of operations an analysis of our results of operations for the three years presented in our consolidated financial statements for our three operating segments water infrastructure  mineral exploration and energy 
liquidity and capital resources an analysis of cash flows  aggregate financial commitments and certain financial condition ratios 
critical accounting policies a discussion of our critical accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment or complexity 
this section also includes the impact of new accounting standards 
our business the company is a multinational company that provides drilling and construction services and related products in two principal markets water infrastructure and mineral exploration  as well as operates as a producer of oil and unconventional natural gas for the energy market 
we operate throughout north america  as well as in africa  australia  brazil and italy 
we also operate through our affiliates in south america 
layne christensen s customers include municipalities  investor owned water utilities  industrial companies  global mining companies  consulting engineering firms  heavy civil construction contractors  oil and gas companies and agribusiness 
management defines the company s operational organizational structure into discrete divisions based on its primary product lines 
each division comprises a combination of individual district offices  which primarily offer similar types of services and serve similar types of markets 
although individual offices within a division may periodically perform services normally provided by another division  the results of those services are recorded in the office s own division 
for example  if a mineral exploration division office performed water well drilling services  the revenues would be recorded in the mineral exploration division rather than the water infrastructure division 
the company s reporting segments are defined as follows water infrastructure division this division provides a full line of water and wastewater related services and products including soil stabilization  hydrological studies  well design  drilling and well development  pump installation  sewer rehabilitation  pipeline construction and well rehabilitation 
the division s offerings include the design and construction of treatment facilities and the provision of filter media and membranes to treat volatile organics and other contaminants such as nitrates  iron  manganese  arsenic  radium and radon in groundwater 
the division also offers environmental drilling services to assess and monitor groundwater contaminants 
through internal growth and acquisitions  the division has continued to expand its capabilities in the areas of the design and build of water and wastewater treatment plants  water treatment product research and development  sewer rehabilitation  water and wastewater transmission lines and soil stabilization 
the division s operations rely heavily on the municipal sector as approximately of the division s fiscal revenues were derived from the municipal market 
the municipal sector can be adversely impacted by economic slowdowns 
reduced tax revenues can limit spending and new development by local municipalities 
generally  spending levels in the municipal sector lag an economic recession or recovery 
mineral exploration division this division provides a complete range of drilling services for the mineral exploration industry 
its aboveground and underground drilling activities include all phases of core drilling  diamond  reverse circulation  dual tube  hammer and rotary air blast methods 
demand for the company s mineral exploration drilling services depends upon the level of mineral exploration and development activities conducted by mining companies  particularly with respect to gold and copper 
mineral exploration is highly speculative and is influenced by a variety of factors  including the prevailing prices for various metals that often fluctuate widely and the availability of credit for mining companies 
the division relies heavily on mining activity in africa where approximately of total division revenues were generated for fiscal the company believes this concentration of risk is mitigated by working for larger international mining companies and the establishment of permanent operating facilities in africa 
operating difficulties  including but not limited to  political instability  workforce instability  harsh environment  disease and remote locations  all create natural barriers to entry in this market by competitors 
the company believes it has positioned itself as a market leader in africa and has established the infrastructure to operate effectively 
energy division this division focuses on the exploration and production of unconventional gas and  to a lesser extent  oil properties 
this division has primarily been concentrated on projects in the mid continent region of the united states 
the expansion of the company s energy division is contingent upon significant cash investments to develop the company s unproved acreage 
the company expects to spend approximately  in development activities in fiscal the production curve for a typical unconventional gas well in the company s operating market is generally years 
accordingly  the company expects to earn a return on its investment through proceeds from gas production over an extended period 
however  future revenues and profits will be dependent upon a number of factors including consumption levels for natural gas  commodity prices  the economic feasibility of gas exploration and production and the discovery rate of new gas reserves 
the company has net producing wells on line as of january  other other includes small service companies and any other specialty operations not included in one of the other divisions 
key events we have completed three acquisitions during fiscal  bencor corporation of america foundation specialist bencor in the third quarter and diberil sociedad an nima diberil and intevras technologies  llc intevras in the second quarter 
all of these acquisitions have occurred in our water infrastructure division 
bencor is a foundation construction and underground engineering company operating in the us  and was purchased to complement and expand our geoconstruction capabilities 
we acquired a interest in diberil  a specialty foundation and marine geotechnical provider operating in brazil and uruguay 
this investment was made to expand our soil stabilization service capabilities into these geographic markets 
intevras is a texas based water treatment operation focusing on the treatment and handling of industrial wastewater which will expand our offerings in the industrial water markets 
in a joint drilling operation with our affiliates in chile  our personnel and equipment succeeded in reaching trapped miners at the san jose mine in chile 
the rescue efforts were completed two months ahead of original estimates 
we experienced continued improvements in the minerals exploration markets served by our wholly owned operations and our affiliates 
revenues have increased for the year and pre tax earnings have improved 
the company s water supply contract in afghanistan continued during the year 
for the year we have recognized revenue of million from that contract 
we have recently been informed that the drilling program will be curtailed  and expect our involvement to wind down over the course of the first quarter of fiscal the majority of the company s forward sales contracts in its energy division expired in march  and as a result of unfavorable natural gas pricing have not been renewed 
revenues in this division have accordingly dropped for the year 
impact of new federal legislation in the first quarter of fiscal  the patient protection and affordable care act and the health care and education reconciliation act were signed into law 
because the company generally does not offer post employment healthcare benefits  the company was not required to recognize a significant charge associated with the change in tax treatment of medicare part d benefits 
internal investigation see part i  items legal proceedings and a risk factors in this form k for additional information regarding our internal investigation of compliance with the fcpa

cost of revenues increased  or to  of revenues for fiscal  compared to  of revenues for fiscal the increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily due to margin pressures in our heavy construction and energy businesses  partially offset by higher margins in mineral exploration  on our work in afghanistan and on certain soil stabilization projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of increased incentive compensation expenses of   in added expenses from acquired operations  an increase in consulting expenses of  primarily related to systems implementation and merger and acquisition projects  and an increase in other compensation costs of  these increases were partially offset by a decrease as the prior year included  of settlement charges recorded for the elimination of our hourly pension plan liabilities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses were  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to  lower depletion in the energy division as a result of updated estimates of economically recoverable gas reserves  partially offset by higher depreciation in the water infrastructure division from acquired assets and ongoing capital expenditures 
in fiscal  the company recorded a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties of  or  after income taxes  primarily as a result of a significant continued decline in natural gas prices and the expiration of higher priced forward sales contracts 
there were no such impairments recorded in fiscal during fiscal  the company received litigation settlements valued at  the settlements included receipt of land and buildings valued at  and cash receipts of  net of contingent attorney fees 
there were no litigation settlement gains in fiscal equity in earnings of affiliates was  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase reflects the impact of an improved minerals exploration market in latin america  primarily for gold and copper in chile and peru

as earnings increase  these factors will have a reduced impact on the effective rate since they are relatively fixed 
operating segment review of operations water infrastructure division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before income taxes water infrastructure revenues increased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to additional revenues of  from operations acquired in the current and prior year  an increase of  in sewer rehabilitation revenue and an increase in revenue from our water supply contract in afghanistan 
for the year we have recognized revenue of  related to our water supply contract in afghanistan  compared to  in the prior year 
we have been informed that the drilling program in afghanistan will be curtailed  and expect our involvement to wind down over the course of the first quarter of fiscal the increased revenue in sewer rehabilitation was primarily concentrated in the eastern us and texas 
the increases were partially offset by a reduction in heavy construction revenue of  primarily from a large utility contract in colorado that was substantially completed last year 
income before income taxes for the water infrastructure division increased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to  from operations acquired in the current and prior year and our project in afghanistan  partially offset by reduced earnings in our heavy construction operations and overall increases of  in incentive compensation 
for the year the afghanistan project contributed  to income before income taxes  compared to  in the prior year 
the backlog in the water infrastructure division was  as of january   compared to  as of january  mineral exploration division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before income taxes mineral exploration revenues increased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase was driven by increased activity levels across all locations  the largest of which were in africa  the western us and mexico 
income before income taxes for the mineral exploration division increased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase resulted primarily from improved margins  combined with higher revenues 
equity earnings from our affiliates  reduced earlier in the year by a customer driven project delay  improved in the last half of the year as the projects were caught up  increasing  for the year 
during fiscal  the company received a litigation settlement in australia of  earnings were offset by an increase of  in incentive compensation and by costs incurred in connection with our internal fcpa investigation 
energy division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income loss before income taxes energy revenues decreased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to lower natural gas prices and the expiration of favorably priced forward sales contracts in the first quarter of this year 
for fiscal  net gas production was  mmcf compared to  mmcf for fiscal the average net sales price per mcf on production for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the net sales price excludes revenues generated from third party gas 
during fiscal  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge of  or  after income tax  for the carrying value of the assets in excess of future net cash flows 
also  during fiscal  we recorded settlement gains  net of attorney fees  of  related to litigation against former officers of a subsidiary and associated energy production companies 
excluding the non cash impairment charge and litigation gains  income before income taxes for the energy division decreased to  for fiscal  compared to income of  for fiscal the decrease in income before income taxes was due to the impact on revenues from lower natural gas prices and the expiration of forward sales contracts as noted above  partially offset by depletion decreasing  other fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before income taxes other revenues increased primarily as a result of revenues of  from machining and fabrication operations 
the increase in income before income tax resulted primarily from energy service related projects 
unallocated corporate expenses corporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions  primarily included in selling  general and administrative expenses  were  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily due to an increase in incentive compensation of  based on increased earnings and an increase in consulting fees of  related to systems implementation and merger and acquisition projects 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction of  in settlement charges recorded last year for the elimination of our hourly pension plan liabilities 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues for fiscal decreased  or  to  compared to  for fiscal a further discussion of results of operations by division is presented below 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal and of revenues  respectively 
the decrease was primarily the result of decreased compensation related expenses  lower legal  professional and consulting fees and reduced travel 
these reductions were partially offset by  in settlement charges recorded for the elimination of our hourly pension plan liabilities and increased non income tax expenses of  compensation expenses declined based on lower incentive compensation given the company s reduced earnings  as well as headcount reductions 
other expense reductions were primarily due to lower activity levels and cost control measures 
the increased non income tax expenses were primarily due to a reassessment in the first quarter of the recoverability of value added tax balances in certain foreign jurisdictions given declines in those economies and higher business tax expenses in those jurisdictions 
depreciation  depletion and amortization increased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher depletion in the energy division and depreciation on capital expenditures in the water infrastructure division 
the higher depletion is a result of reduced estimated proved oil and gas reserves due to lower spot gas prices  which are used in estimating future economic production 
the company recorded non cash impairments to oil and gas properties of  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  with including  related to an exploration project in chile 
the impairments are primarily a result of low gas prices in the company s markets  as noted above  and the expiration of higher priced forward sales contracts 
on an after tax basis  the impairments were  and  for and  respectively 
the company recorded litigation settlement gains of  and  for the years ended january  and the settlements in included receipt of land and buildings valued at  and cash receipts of  net of contingent attorney fees 
cash receipts  net of contingent attorney fees  of  were received for the year ended january  equity in earnings of affiliates decreased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decrease reflects the impact of a soft minerals exploration market in latin america  primarily for gold and copper 
interest expense decreased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decrease was primarily a result of scheduled debt reductions 
the company recorded income tax expense of  an effective rate of and  an effective rate of for fiscal and  respectively 
the effective rates exceeded statutory rates due to the impact of nondeductible expenses and the taxation of foreign income 
the company s effective rate in both years was further impacted by lower pretax income as a result of the non cash impairment charges in the energy division 
excluding the impairments and related tax benefits  the company would have recorded income tax expense of  an adjusted effective rate of and  an adjusted effective rate of for each year 
the higher adjusted effective rate in over resulted primarily from the impact of nondeductible expenses as adjusted pretax income declined 
operating segment review of operations water infrastructure division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before income taxes water infrastructure revenues decreased to  for fiscal  from  for fiscal the decrease occurred across all major product lines  except ranney collector wells and our specialty geoconstruction services 
the decreases were partially offset by revenues from recently acquired businesses of  although revenues were down across the country  the most affected locations were in the western us  where weakness in housing construction and lower municipal government spending has significantly impacted our markets 
revenues for our specialty geoconstruction services were strong in the second half of the year due to a contract to assist in flood control in new orleans 
the contract is expected to last into the first quarter of fiscal income before income taxes for the water infrastructure division decreased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal reduced revenue levels and margin pressures from increased competition  as well as difficulties on several projects  contributed to the decline 
profits on the new orleans project partially offset declines in the last six months 
cost control measures  including headcount reductions  continue as we seek to match expenses to lower activity levels in most of our product lines 
the backlog in the water infrastructure division was  as of january   compared to  as of january  mineral exploration division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before income taxes mineral exploration revenues decreased to  for fiscal  compared to revenues of  for fiscal the decreased activity levels which began in the fourth quarter of last year continued for much of the year  with revenue declines in virtually all of the division s markets driven by economic uncertainty 
revenue did improve somewhat in the fourth quarter  with revenue  higher than the fourth quarter last year 
the increase was primarily in mexico and west africa 
income before income taxes for the mineral exploration division decreased to  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal during fiscal  we had two unusual items  receipt of a litigation settlement in australia of  and increased non income tax expense of  due to a reassessment of the recoverability of value added taxes and accruals for certain other business tax expenses in foreign jurisdictions 
operations in north america were profitable  partially offset by losses in africa and australia 
the equity in earnings of affiliates declined at a slower rate than the remainder of the division  reflecting higher stability from certain longer term contracts 
we have aggressively reduced staffing and other costs in dealing with the reduced market activity 
the increased revenue noted in the fourth quarter  along with the effect of cost reduction measures  produced income before income taxes of  as compared to  in the fourth quarter last year 
energy division fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues loss before income taxes energy revenues decreased to  for fiscal  compared to revenues of  for fiscal revenue on the forward sales contracts in place increased for the year  although it was more than offset by lower transportation revenue for third party gas 
in fiscal  the company recorded non cash impairment charges of  for the carrying value of the assets in excess of future net cash flows  and in fiscal  the company recorded non cash impairment charges of  the company also recorded a  non cash impairment of oil and gas properties in fiscal  related to the company s exploration project in chile  begun in if natural gas prices do not improve or the company is not able to enter into new forward sales contracts at attractive prices  additional impairments could occur in fiscal as of january   the remaining net book value of assets subject to impairment was during the years ended january  and  we recorded settlement gains  net of attorney fees  of  and  respectively  related to litigation against former officers of a subsidiary and associated energy production companies 
excluding the non cash impairment charges  income before income taxes for the energy division decreased to  for fiscal compared to  for fiscal the decrease in income before income taxes was primarily due to  of higher depletion based on decreased proved oil and gas reserves and the lower litigation settlement  partially offset by higher contract prices and volume on forward sales contracts in place compared to the prior year  and steps taken to reduce operating costs and increase efficiency in our field operations 
other fiscal years ended january  in thousands revenues income before income taxes activity in our other specialty operations was down as compared to last year primarily due to contracts in canada and africa last year that did not repeat 
unallocated corporate expenses corporate expenses not allocated to individual divisions  primarily included in selling  general and administrative expenses  were  for fiscal  compared to  for fiscal the increase for the year was due to  in additional expense in fiscal for settlement of our pension benefit obligations see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements partially offset by decreased expense for legal and professional fees and compensation related expenses 
fluctuation in quarterly results the company historically has experienced fluctuations in its quarterly results arising from the timing of the award and completion of contracts  the recording of related revenues and unanticipated additional costs incurred on projects 
the company s revenues on large  long term contracts are recognized on a percentage of completion basis for individual contracts based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues and gross profit in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
a significant number of the company s contracts contain fixed prices and assign responsibility to the company for cost overruns for the subject projects  as a result  revenues and gross margin may vary from those originally estimated and  depending upon the size of the project  variations from estimated contract performance could affect the company s operating results for a particular quarter 
many of the company s contracts are also subject to cancellation by the customer upon short notice with limited or no damages payable to the company 
in addition  adverse weather conditions  natural disasters  force majeure and other similar events can curtail company operations in various regions of the world throughout the year  resulting in performance delays and increased costs 
moreover  the company s domestic drilling and construction activities and related revenues and earnings tend to decrease in the winter months when adverse weather conditions interfere with access to project sites  as a result  the company s revenues and earnings in its second and third quarters tend to be higher than revenues and earnings in its first and fourth quarters 
accordingly  as a result of the foregoing as well as other factors  quarterly results should not be considered indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full fiscal year 
see the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
inflation management does not believe that the company s operations for the periods discussed have been significantly adversely affected by inflation or changing prices from its suppliers 
liquidity and capital resources management exercises discretion regarding the liquidity and capital resource needs of its business segments 
this includes the ability to prioritize the use of capital and debt capacity  to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding capital expenditures 
the company s primary source of liquidity has historically been cash from operations  supplemented by borrowings under its credit facilities 
the company s working capital as of january  and  was  and  respectively 
the company s cash and cash equivalents as of january  were  compared to  as of january  the decreased amount of cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to cash payments of  for acquisitions  net of cash acquired  and  for scheduled debt payments 
the company believes it will have sufficient cash from operations and access to credit facilities to meet its operating cash requirements  make required debt payments  and fund its capital expenditures 
funding for potential acquisitions will be evaluated based on the particular facts and circumstances of the opportunity 
the company maintains an agreement the master shelf agreement under which it may issue unsecured notes 
under the master shelf agreement  the company has an additional  of unsecured notes available to be issued before september  at january   the company had  in notes outstanding under the master shelf agreement 
as of january   the company maintained an unsecured  revolving credit facility the credit agreement which extended to november  at january   the company had letters of credit of  and  borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement resulting in available capacity of the company s master shelf agreement and credit agreement each contain certain covenants including restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness and liens  investments  acquisitions  transfer or sale of assets  transactions with affiliates and payment of dividends 
these provisions generally allow such activity to occur  subject to specific limitations and continued compliance with financial maintenance covenants 
significant financial maintenance covenants are fixed charge coverage ratio  maximum leverage ratio and minimum tangible net worth 
covenant levels and definitions are consistent between the two agreements 
the company was in compliance with its covenants as of january   and expects to remain in compliance through the term of the agreements 
compliance with the financial covenants is required on a quarterly basis  using the most recent four fiscal quarters 
the company s fixed charge coverage ratio and leverage ratio covenants are based on ratios utilizing adjusted ebitda and adjusted ebitdar  as defined in the agreements 
adjusted ebitda is generally defined as consolidated net income excluding net interest expense  provision for income taxes  gains or losses from extraordinary items  gains or losses from the sale of capital assets  non cash items including depreciation and amortization  and share based compensation 
equity in earnings of affiliates is included only to the extent of dividends or distributions received 
adjusted ebitdar is defined as adjusted ebitda  plus rent expense 
the company s tangible net worth covenant is based on stockholders equity less intangible assets 
all of these measures are considered non gaap financial measures and are not intended to be in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant is the ratio of adjusted ebitdar to the sum of fixed charges 
fixed charges consist of rent expense  interest expense  and principal payments of long term debt 
the company s leverage ratio covenant is the ratio of total funded indebtedness to adjusted ebitda 
total funded indebtedness generally consists of outstanding debt  capital leases  unfunded pension liabilities  asset retirement obligations and escrow liabilities 
the company s tangible net worth covenant is measured based on stockholders equity  less intangible assets  as compared to a threshold amount defined in the agreements 
the threshold is adjusted over time based on a percentage of net income and the proceeds from the issuance of equity securities 
as of january  and  the company s actual and required covenant levels were as follows actual required actual required in thousands  except for ratio data minimum fixed charge coverage ratio maximum leverage ratio minimum tangible net worth on march   the company entered into a new revolving credit facility the new credit agreement 
the unsecured  facility extends to march   and replaces the credit agreement  which was terminated 
the master shelf agreement remains in place 
the new credit agreement contains similar financial maintenance covenants to the prior agreement  although a minimum tangible net worth is not required 
the new credit agreement was entered into to extend the expiration period of the company s debt facilities and increase borrowing capacity 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease from to was primarily due to working capital changes  including changes in customer receivables and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
these working capital items typically turnover on average within a day period  therefore  the increase in revenues for fiscal required higher levels of working capital to support 
the negative impact of these working capital items was partially offset by increased levels of accounts payable and accrued expenses 
investing activities the company s capital expenditures  net of disposals  of  for the year ended january   were split between  to maintain and upgrade its equipment and facilities and  toward the company s unconventional natural gas exploration and production 
this compares to equipment spending of  and natural gas exploration and production spending of  in the same period last year 
the increase in equipment and facilities spending was due to equipment purchased to support the company s expansion into the injection well market in florida and facilities expansion in the southwest us to support our water treatment product capabilities 
spending for the company s unconventional gas operations was reduced in fiscal as we scaled back production in reaction to lower gas prices available in our market 
should gas prices remain low  we intend to continue to hold back production and spend capital primarily to meet obligations under our leases 
for the year ended january   the company invested  for acquired businesses  net of cash acquired  including  for a interest in diberil   for bencor  and  for intevras 
these investments were offset in part by the sale of layne geobrazil  a wholly owned subsidiary  for a cash payment of  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this compares to acquisition related spending of  last year 
the company intends to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities to enhance its existing service offerings and to expand our geographic market 
the company s capital expenditures  net of proceeds from disposals  of  for the year ended january   were split between  to maintain and upgrade its construction equipment and  toward the company s unconventional gas exploration and production  including the construction of gas pipeline infrastructure near the company s development projects 
spending for the company s unconventional gas operations was reduced significantly in fiscal as we scaled back production in reaction to lower gas prices available in our market 
the company s capital expenditures  net of proceeds from disposals  of  for the year ended january   were split between  to maintain and upgrade its construction equipment and  toward the company s expansion into unconventional gas exploration and production  including the construction of gas pipeline infrastructure near the company s development projects 
during the year  the company spent  to complete acquisitions to complement its water infrastructure division 
financing activities for the year ended january   the company had incremental borrowings of  under its revolving credit facility and made  in scheduled debt payments on its senior notes 
the company had no borrowings under its revolving credit facilities during the years ended january  and  financing the business from operations and available cash 
the company made scheduled principal payments on the senior notes of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january   are summarized as follows payments expiration by period in thousands total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations and other commercial commitments senior notes credit agreement interest payments software financing obligations operating leases mineral interest obligations income tax uncertainties total contractual obligations standby letters of credit asset retirement obligations total contractual obligations and commercial commitments the company expects to meet its cash contractual obligations in the ordinary course of operations  and that the standby letters of credit will be renewed in connection with its annual insurance renewal process 
interest is payable on the credit agreement at variable interest rates equal to  at the company s option  a libor rate plus to  or a base rate  as defined in the credit agreement plus up to  depending on the company s leverage ratio 
interest is payable on the senior notes at a fixed interest rate of see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest payments have been included in the table above based only on outstanding balances on the senior notes as of january  the company s new credit agreement  entered into on march   replacing the credit agreement  has variable interest payable at a libor rate plus to or a base rate plus up to 
the company has income tax uncertainties in the amount of  at january   that are classified as non current on the company s balance sheet as resolution of these matters is expected to take more than a year 
the ultimate timing of resolution of these items is uncertain  and accordingly the amounts have not been included in the table above 
the company incurs additional obligations in the ordinary course of operations 
these obligations  including but not limited to income tax payments  are expected to be met in the normal course of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  which are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  located in item of this form k 
we believe that the following represent our more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  although not all inclusive 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized on large  long term construction contracts meeting the criteria of accounting standards codification asc topic construction type and production type contracts asc topic  using the percentage of completion method based upon the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
contract price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as work progresses and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in contract revenues in the reporting period when such estimates are revised 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  change orders and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
as allowed by asc topic  revenue is recognized on smaller  short term construction contracts using the completed contract method 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted construction contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
revenues for direct sales of equipment and other ancillary products not provided in conjunction with the performance of construction contracts are recognized at the date of delivery to  and acceptance by  the customer 
provisions for estimated warranty obligations are made in the period in which the sales occur 
contracts for the company s mineral exploration drilling services are billable based on the quantity of drilling performed 
thus  revenues for these drilling contracts are recognized on the basis of actual footage or meterage drilled 
revenues for the sale of oil and gas by the company s energy division are recognized on the basis of volumes sold at the time of delivery to an end user or an interstate pipeline  net of amounts attributable to royalty or working interest holders 
the company s revenues are presented net of taxes imposed on revenue producing transactions with its customers  such as  but not limited to  sales  use  value added and some excise taxes 
oil and gas properties and mineral interests the company follows the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells  and salaries  benefits and other internal salary related costs directly attributable to these activities 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
normal dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
capitalized costs are depleted based on units of production 
the company is required to review the carrying value of its oil and gas properties under the full cost accounting rules of the sec the ceiling test 
the ceiling limitation is the estimated after tax future net revenues from proved oil and gas properties discounted at  plus the cost of properties not subject to amortization 
if the net book value of our oil and gas properties  less related deferred income taxes  is in excess of the calculated ceiling  the excess must be written off as an expense 
in accordance with changes in the sec rules  beginning at our fiscal year end  application of the ceiling test requires pricing future revenues at the unweighted arithmetic average of the first day of the month price for each month within the month period prior to the end of reporting period  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements such as fixed price physical delivery forward sales contracts 
considerations of the ceiling test prior to the fiscal year end used the period end price  as adjusted for contractual arrangements 
unproved oil and gas properties are not amortized  but are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis using a comparison of the carrying values of the unproved properties to net future cash flows 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairments recorded in fiscal and reserve estimates the company s estimates of oil and natural gas reserves  by necessity  are projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations by governmental agencies and assumptions governing oil and natural gas prices  future operating costs  severance  ad valorem and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows expected therefrom may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value of the company s oil and gas properties and the rate of depletion of the oil and gas properties 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to the company s reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
goodwill the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
the impairment evaluation for goodwill is conducted annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired 
the evaluation is performed by using a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is generally determined on the basis of discounted future cash flows 
if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit  then a second step must be completed in order to determine the amount of the goodwill impairment that should be recorded 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including any unrecognized intangible assets in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the resulting implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge is recorded for the difference 
the assumptions used in the estimates of fair value for the first step are generally consistent with the past performance of each reporting unit and are also consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in current operating plans 
the more significant assumptions  which are subject to change as a result of changing economic and competitive conditions  are as follows anticipated future cash flows and long term growth rates for each reporting unit 
the income approach to determining fair value relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows  including an estimate of long term growth rates 
the projections use management s estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including growth rates in sales and estimates of expected changes in operating margins 
the company s projections of future cash flows are subject to change as actual results are achieved that differ from those anticipated 
actual results could vary significantly from estimates 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is subject to changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants in our industry 
the discount rate is determined based on assumptions that would be used by marketplace participants  and for that reason  the capital structure of selected marketplace participants was used in the weighted average cost of capital analysis 
given the current volatile economic conditions  it is possible that the discount rate could change 
the company s goodwill balance was  as of january  goodwill is evaluated at the reporting unit level  which may be the same as a reporting segment or a level below a reporting segment 
the goodwill balance by reporting segment and reporting unit as of january  is as follows operating segment reporting unit goodwill balance in thousands water infrastructure water resources water infrastructure reynolds water infrastructure geoconstruction energy energy total the fair value of the water resources  reynolds  geoconstruction and energy reporting units substantially exceed their carrying value by over 
other long lived assets long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets and the company s gas transportation facilities and equipment  are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include but are not limited to the following significant underperformance of our assets  significant changes in the use of the assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the company believes at this time that the carrying values and useful lives of its long lived assets continue to be appropriate 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable the company makes ongoing estimates relating to the ability to collect its accounts receivable and maintains an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  the company makes judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers based on ongoing credit evaluations  and also considers a review of accounts receivable aging  industry trends  customer financial strength  credit standing  and payment history to assess the probability of collection 
since the company cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of its customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from estimates 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance might be required which could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
accrued insurance expense the company maintains insurance programs where it is responsible for a certain amount of each claim up to a retention limit 
estimates are recorded for health and welfare  property and casualty insurance costs that are associated with these programs 
these costs are estimated based on actuarially determined projections of future payments under these programs 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated or medical costs increase beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs could be required 
costs estimated to be incurred in the future for employee health and welfare benefits  property  workers compensation and casualty insurance programs resulting from claims which have occurred are accrued currently 
under the terms of the company s agreement with the various insurance carriers administering these claims  the company is not required to remit the total premium until the claims are actually paid by the insurance companies 
these costs are not expected to significantly impact liquidity in future periods 
income taxes income taxes are provided using the asset liability method  in which deferred taxes are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reviewed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided as necessary 
provision for us income taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates is made only on those amounts in excess of funds considered to be invested indefinitely 
litigation and other contingencies the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business  the disposition of which is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s assumptions related to these proceedings 
in accordance with us gaap  we record a liability when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
these provisions are reviewed at least quarterly and adjusted to reflect the impacts of negotiations  settlements  rulings  advice of legal counsel  and other information and events pertaining to a particular case 
to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s estimate of its probable liability in these matters may change 
share based compensation the company accounts for share based awards in accordance with the framework established in the share based compensation guidance 
share based compensation is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
the company determines the fair value of option awards using the black scholes model 
the black scholes model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected life  stock price volatility and the forfeiture rate 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks to which the company is exposed are interest rate risk on variable rate debt  foreign exchange rate risk that could give rise to translation and transaction gains and losses and fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas 
interest rate risk the company centrally manages its debt portfolio considering overall financing strategies and tax consequences 
a description of the company s debt is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
as of january   an instantaneous change in interest rates of one percentage point would impact the company s annual interest expense by approximately  the company did not have any variable rate debt outstanding as of january  and foreign currency risk operating in international markets involves exposure to possible volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
currently  the company s primary international operations are in australia  africa  mexico  canada  brazil and italy 
the operations are described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s affiliates also operate in south america and mexico see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the majority of the company s contracts in africa and mexico are us dollar based  providing a natural reduction in exposure to currency fluctuations 
the company also may utilize various hedge instruments  primarily foreign currency option contracts  to manage the exposures associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of january   the company did have any outstanding foreign currency option contracts 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of the company s international operations into us dollars may affect year to year comparability of operating results 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would impact income before income taxes by approximately   and  for the years ended january   and  respectively 
this represents approximately of the income before income taxes of international businesses after adjusting for primarily us dollar based operations 
this quantitative measure has inherent limitations  as it does not take into account any governmental actions  changes in customer purchasing patterns or changes in the company s financing and operating strategies 
foreign exchange gains and losses in the company s consolidated statements of income reflect transaction gains and losses and translation gains and losses from the company s mexican and african operations which use the us dollar as their functional currency 
net foreign exchange losses gains for the years ended january   and  were   and  respectively 
commodity price risk the company is exposed to fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas  which impact the sale of the energy division s oil and unconventional gas production 
the prices of oil and natural gas are volatile and the company enters into fixed price physical contracts  if available at attractive prices  to cover a portion of its production to manage price fluctuations and to achieve a more predictable cash flow 
the company generally intends to maintain contracts in place to cover to of its production 
as of january   the company did not have any of these contracts in place due to continued low prices in the forward sales markets 
the company intends to continue monitoring forward sales prices and will reevaluate its forward sales commitments accordingly over the course of fiscal the company estimates that a change in the prices of oil and natural gas would have impacted income before taxes by approximately  for the year ended january   based on the company s production which was sold on a spot market basis during the year 
this measure is exclusive of any potential impact on its impairment computation
