item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we believe we are one of the largest suppliers of outsourced healthcare professional staffing and administrative services to hospitals and other healthcare providers in the united states  based upon revenues and patient visits 
our regional operating models also include comprehensive programs for inpatient care  pediatrics and other healthcare services  principally within hospital departments and other healthcare treatment facilities 
we have focused  however  primarily on providing outsourced services to hospital eds  which accounts for the majority of our net revenues 
the corporate conversion effective december   we converted from a limited liability company to a corporation in connection with our initial public offering 
in addition to converting class a units  class b units and class c units into common stock  each holder of class b units and class c units was also issued vested and unvested options to acquire shares of our common stock in substitution for part of the economic benefits of their outstanding class b units or class c units not reflected in the conversion of the units into shares of common stock  with the exercise price of these options equal to the initial public offering price or such higher price as was necessary to accurately reflect the terms of the class b units or class c units to which they relate 
the common stock received in the conversion associated with unvested class b units and class c units and the unvested options are subject to the same vesting schedule that was previously applied to the class b units or class c units to which they relate 
a total of million of pre tax non cash share based compensation expense was and will be recognized in connection with a portion of these option grants 
approximately million of this expense was recognized in december and million during with the remaining million expense to be amortized over the vesting period of the applicable common stock and options 
initial public offering in december  we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock 
including the subsequent exercise in january of the underwriters over allotment option to purchase  shares  a total of  shares were sold 
the total number of outstanding common shares was  as of december   and the total number of outstanding common shares after the exercise of the over allotment option was  our net proceeds of approximately million from the offering were used for the pro rata redemption of approximately million aggregate amount of our senior subordinated notes due we completed the initial million redemption on january   and the additional million redemption using the over allotment option proceeds was completed on february  factors and trends that affect our results of operations in reading our financial statements  you should be aware of the following factors and trends that we believe are important in understanding our financial performance 

table of contents general economic conditions the continuation of the current economic conditions may adversely impact our ability to collect for the services we provide as higher unemployment and reductions in commercial managed care and governmental healthcare enrollment may increase the number of uninsured and underinsured patients seeking healthcare at one of our staffed eds 
we could be negatively affected if the federal government or the states reduce funding of medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs in response to increasing deficits in their budgets 
also  patient volume trends in our hospital eds could be adversely affected as individuals potentially defer or forego seeking care in such departments due to the loss or reduction of coverage previously available to such individuals under commercial insurance or governmental healthcare programs 
healthcare reform the president of the united states and members of the us congress have enacted significant reforms to the us healthcare system 
on march   the president signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act  and on march   the president signed into law the health care and education reconciliation act of referred to collectively as the health reform laws 
the health reform laws include a number of provisions that may affect us  although the impact of many of the changes will be unknown until they are implemented  which in some cases will not occur for several years 
the impact of some of these provisions may be positive  such as increasing access to health benefits for the uninsured and underinsured populations  while other provisions such as medicare payment reforms and reductions that could reduce provider payments may have an adverse effect on the reimbursement rates we receive for services provided by affiliated healthcare professionals 
medicare fee schedule changes the medicare program reimburses for our services based upon the rates in its physician fee schedule  and each year the medicare program updates the physician fee schedule reimbursement rates based on a formula approved by congress in the balanced budget act of many private payers use the medicare fee schedule to determine their own reimbursement rates 
the medicare law requires the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms to adjust the medicare physician fee schedule mpfs payment rates annually based on an updated formula which includes application of the sustainable growth rate sgr that was adopted in the balanced budget act of this formula has yielded negative updates every year beginning in  although cms was able to take administrative steps to avoid a reduction in and congress took a series of legislative actions to prevent reductions each year from to in december  president obama signed into law a one year delay of the sgr reductions that were scheduled to reduce medicare reimbursement by effective january  also included in the law is a one year extension of the geographic practice cost indices gpci floor that has allowed locations with lower cost indices to remain at the base of 
recent cms regulations released in november to update the medicare physician fee schedule included a rebasing of the medical economic index mei that redistributes payments between different specialties 
we estimate that these changes to the fee schedule will reduce reimbursement rates to ed providers by approximately with the impact on our ed revenue estimated to be an approximate million decline 
also included in the cms regulations is a reduction in the physician quality reporting initiative pqri bonus payments 
the impact on our revenue is estimated to be a million decline as compared to revenue 
if further congressional action is not taken regarding sgr  payments will be reduced on january  it is not clear what  if anything  will occur in the long term 
any future reductions in amounts paid by government 
table of contents programs for physician services or changes in methods or regulations governing payment amounts or practices could cause our revenues to decline and we may not be able to offset reduced operating margins through cost reductions  increased volume or otherwise 
military healthcare staffing we are a provider of healthcare professionals serving military personnel and their dependents in military treatment facilities nationwide administered by the us department of defense 
during the fourth quarter of we recognized a non tax deductible charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with our military staffing division 
following the charge there is approximately million of remaining goodwill associated with this division 
the decline in carrying value and resulting goodwill impairment charge resulted from our annual impairment test results and reflects the decline in the military s financial performance and the impact of the more challenging government contracting environment 
the process of awarding military healthcare staffing contracts by the government has changed in recent years toward an increased bias to award certain contracts to qualified small and minority owned businesses 
although we participate in such small and minority owned business awards to the extent we can serve as a sub contractor  our revenues from these arrangements are limited compared to an outright contract award which has been a large contributing factor in the financial performance decline 
in addition  we have been awarded two separate governmental healthcare staffing contracts with estimated annual revenues of million the start of which have been delayed by stop work orders associated with protests filed by other contractors in connection with the award of the contracts 
although we believe we have provided very competitive bids to the government and are in position to resume services under the contracts upon the release of the stop work orders  the uncertainty of the eventual outcome of these awards was considered when analyzing the factors used to determine amount of the impairment 
our revenues derived from military healthcare staffing totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these revenues are generated from contracts that are subject to a competitive bidding process which normally takes place during the third quarter of each year 
a portion of the contracts awarded during the third quarter of will expire during the course of and will be subject to a competitive re bidding and award process 
in the event we are unable to retain these expiring contracts  the operations and financial position of our military staffing business could be further negatively impacted 
approximately and of our military staffing revenue for each of the years ended december  and  respectively  was derived through subcontracting agreements with small business prime contractors 
radiology operations during the fourth quarter of  after an analysis of our radiology operations including past performance and future growth opportunities  we made a decision to shut down our teleradiology and radiology staffing division 
it is anticipated that this process will be completed by the end of the first quarter of for the years ended december   and  the radiology division generated approximately million  million and million of net revenue less provision  respectively 
other than the incurrence of operating costs during the wind down period  we do not currently anticipate any additional significant charges to be realized 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion provides an assessment of our results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 

table of contents our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition net revenue 
net revenue consists of fee for service revenue  contract revenue and other revenue 
net revenue is recorded in the period services are rendered 
our net revenue is principally derived from the provision of healthcare staffing services to patients within healthcare facilities 
the form of billing and related risk of collection for such services may vary by customer 
the following is a summary of the principal forms of our billing arrangements and how net revenue is recognized for each 
a significant portion approximately of our net revenue in the year ended december  and for the year ended december  resulted from fee for service patient visits 
fee for service revenue represents revenue earned under contracts in which we bill and collect the professional component of charges for medical services rendered by our contracted and employed physicians 
under the fee for service arrangements  we bill patients for services provided and receive payment from patients or their third party payers 
fee for service revenue is reported net of contractual allowances and policy discounts 
all services provided are expected to result in cash flows and are therefore reflected as net revenue in the financial statements 
fee for service revenue is recognized in the period that the services are rendered to specific patients and reduced immediately for the estimated impact of contractual allowances in the case of those patients having third party payer coverage 
the recognition of net revenue gross charges less contractual allowances from such visits is dependent on such factors as proper completion of medical charts following a patient visit  the forwarding of such charts to one of our billing centers for medical coding and entering into our billing systems and the verification of each patient s submission or representation at the time services are rendered as to the payer s responsible for payment of such services 
net revenue is recorded based on the information known at the time of entering such information into our billing systems as well as an estimate of the net revenue associated with medical charts for a given service period that have not yet been processed into our billing systems 
the above factors and estimates are subject to change 
for example  patient payer information may change following an initial attempt to bill for services due to a change in payer status 
such changes in payer status have an impact on recorded net revenue due to differing payers being subject to different contractual allowance amounts 
such changes in net revenue are recognized in the period that such changes in the payer become known 
similarly  the actual volume of medical charts not processed into our billing systems may be different from the amounts estimated 
such differences in net revenue are adjusted the following month based on actual chart volumes processed 
contract revenue represents revenue generated under contracts in which we provide physician and other healthcare staffing and administrative services in return for a contractually negotiated fee 
contract revenue consists primarily of billings based on hours of healthcare staffing provided at agreed upon hourly rates 
revenue in such cases is recognized as the hours worked by our staff and contractors 
additionally  contract revenue includes supplemental revenue from hospitals where we may have a fee for service contract arrangement 
contract revenue for the supplemental billing in such cases is recognized based on the terms of each individual contract 
such contract terms generally either provide for a fixed monthly dollar amount or a variable amount based upon measurable monthly activity  such as hours staffed  patient visits or collections per visit compared to a minimum activity threshold 
such supplemental revenues based on variable arrangements are usually contractually fixed on a monthly  quarterly or annual calculation basis considering the variable factors negotiated in each such arrangement 
such supplemental revenues are recognized as revenue in the period when such amounts are determined to be fixed and therefore contractually obligated as payable by the customer under the terms of the respective agreement 
other revenue consists primarily of revenue from management and billing services provided to outside parties 
revenue is recognized for such services pursuant to the terms of the contracts with customers 
generally  such contracts consist of fixed monthly amounts with revenue recognized in the month services are rendered or 
table of contents as hourly consulting fees recognized as revenue as hours worked in accordance with such arrangements 
additionally  we derive a portion of our revenues from providing billing services that are contingent upon the collection of third party physician billings by us on behalf of such customers 
revenues are not considered earned and therefore not recognized as revenue until actual cash collections are achieved in accordance with the contractual arrangements for such services 
net revenue less provision for uncollectibles 
net revenue less provision for uncollectibles reflects management s estimate of billed amounts to ultimately be collected 
management  in estimating the amounts to be collected resulting from over seven million annual fee for service patient visits and procedures  considers such factors as prior contract collection experience  current period changes in payer mix and patient acuity indicators  reimbursement rate trends in governmental and private sector insurance programs  resolution of overprovision account balances  the estimated impact of billing system effectiveness improvement initiatives  and trends in collections from self pay patients and external collection agencies 
in developing our estimate of collections per visit or procedure  we consider the amount of outstanding gross accounts receivable by period of service  but do not use an accounts receivable aging schedule to establish estimated collection valuations 
individual estimates of net revenue less provision by contractual location are monitored and refreshed each month as cash receipts are applied to existing accounts receivable and other current trends that have an impact upon the estimated collections per visit are observed 
such estimates are substantially formulaic in nature 
in the ordinary course of business we experience changes in our initial estimates of net revenues less provision for uncollectibles during the year following commencement of services 
such provisions and any subsequent changes in estimates may result in adjustments to our operating results with a corresponding adjustment to our accounts receivable allowance for uncollectibles on our balance sheet 
differences between amounts ultimately realized and the initial estimates of net revenue less provision have historically not been material 
net revenue less provision for uncollectibles for the years ended december   and  respectively  consisted of the following in thousands gross fee for service charges unbilled revenue less contractual adjustments fee for service revenue contract revenue other revenue net revenue less provision for uncollectibles net revenue less provision for uncollectibles contractual adjustments represent our estimate of discounts and other adjustments to be recognized from gross fee for service charges under contractual payment arrangements  primarily with commercial  managed care and governmental payment plans such as medicare and medicaid when affiliated providers participate in such plans 
the increase in contractual adjustments noted above is due to the overall increase in gross fee for service charges resulting from annual increases in our gross billing fee schedules and increases in patient visits and procedures between periods 
contractual adjustments increased at a faster pace than the increase in gross fee for service charges as the annual reimbursement increases under contracts with managed care plans and government payers that are subject to contractual adjustments tend to be less than the overall annual increase in our gross billing fee schedules 

table of contents the table below summarizes our approximate payer mix as a percentage of fee for service patient volume for the periods indicated year ended december  payer medicare medicaid commercial and managed care self pay other total accounts receivable 
as described above and below  we determine the estimated value of our accounts receivable based on estimated cash collection run rates of estimated future collections  by facility contract  for patient visits under our fee for service contract revenue 
accordingly  we are unable to report the payer mix composition on a dollar basis of our outstanding net accounts receivable 
however  a change in the estimated carrying value of our net fee for service patient accounts receivable before consideration of the allowance for uncollectible accounts at december  could have an after tax effect of approximately million on our financial position and results of operations 
our days of revenue outstanding at december  and at december   were days and days  respectively 
the number of days outstanding will fluctuate over time due to a number of factors 
the decrease in average days outstanding of approximately days includes a decrease of days resulting from an increase in average revenue per day and a decrease of days associated with a reduction in the estimated value of contract accounts receivable 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of days related to the increase in estimated value of fee for service accounts receivable 
the increase in average revenue per day is primarily attributable to an increase in gross charges  increased pricing with managed care plans  increases in average patient acuity  and increases in medicare reimbursements 
the decrease of days associated with the reduction of contract accounts receivable and the increase of days related to fee for service accounts receivable are due primarily to timing of cash collections and valuation adjustments recorded in the period 
our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million as of december  approximately of our allowance for doubtful accounts is related to gross fees for fee for service patient visits 
our principal exposure for uncollectible fee for service visits is centered in self pay patients and  to a lesser extent  for co payments and deductibles from patients with insurance 
while we do not specifically allocate the allowance for doubtful accounts to individual accounts or specific payer classifications  the portion of the allowance associated with fee for service charges as of december  was equal to approximately of outstanding self pay fee for service patient accounts 
the majority of our fee for service patient visits are for the provision of emergency care in hospital settings 
due to federal government regulations governing the provision of such care  we are obligated to provide emergency care regardless of the patient s ability to pay or whether or not the patient has insurance or other third party coverage for the costs of the services rendered 
while we attempt to obtain all relevant billing information at the time emergency care services are rendered  there are numerous patient encounters where such information is not available at time of discharge 
in such cases where detailed billing information relative to insurance or other third party coverage is not available at discharge  we attempt to obtain such information from the patient or client hospital billing record information subsequent to discharge to facilitate the collections process 
collections at the time of rendering such services emergency room discharge are not significant 
primary responsibility for collection of fee for service accounts receivable resides within our internal billing operations 
once a claim has been submitted to a payer or an individual patient  employees within our billing operations are responsible for the follow up collection efforts 
the protocol for follow up differs by payer 
table of contents classification 
for self pay patients  our billing system will automatically send a series of dunning letters on a prescribed time frame requesting payment or the provision of information reflecting that the balance due is covered by another payer  such as medicare or a third party insurance plan 
generally  the dunning cycle on a self pay account will run from to days 
at the end of this period  if no collections or additional information is obtained from the patient  the account is no longer considered an active account and is transferred to a collection agency 
upon transfer to a collection agency  the patient account is written off as a bad debt 
any subsequent cash receipts on accounts previously written off are recorded as a recovery 
for non self pay accounts  billing personnel will follow up and respond to any communication from payers such as requests for additional information or denials until collection of the account is obtained or other resolution has occurred 
at the completion of our collection cycle  we factor on a non recourse basis selected patient accounts to external collection agencies while other selected accounts may be transferred to collection agencies under a contingent collection basis 
the projected value of future factoring and contingent collection proceeds are considered in the estimation of our overall accounts receivable valuation 
for contract accounts receivable  invoices for services are prepared in our various operating areas and mailed to our customers  generally on a monthly basis 
contract terms under such arrangements generally require payment within days of receipt of the invoice 
outstanding invoices are periodically reviewed and operations personnel with responsibility for the customer relationship will contact the customer to follow up on any delinquent invoices 
contract accounts receivable will be considered as bad debt and written off based upon the individual circumstances of the customer situation after all collection efforts have been exhausted  including legal action if warranted  and it is the judgment of management that the account is not expected to be collected 
methodology for computing allowance for doubtful accounts 
we employ several methodologies for determining our allowance for doubtful accounts depending on the nature of the net revenue recognized 
we initially determine gross revenue for our fee for service patient visits based upon established fee schedule prices 
such gross revenue is reduced for estimated contractual allowances for those patient visits covered by contractual insurance arrangements to result in net revenue 
net revenue is then reduced for our estimate of uncollectible amounts 
fee for service net revenue less provision for uncollectibles represents our estimated cash to be collected from such patient visits and is net of our estimate of account balances estimated to be uncollectible 
the provision for uncollectible fee for service patient visits is based on historical experience resulting from over seven million annual fee for service patient visits 
the significant volume of patient visits and the terms of thousands of commercial and managed care contracts and the various reimbursement policies relating to governmental healthcare programs do not make it feasible to evaluate fee for service accounts receivable on a specific account basis 
fee for service accounts receivable collection estimates are reviewed on a quarterly basis for each of our fee for service contracts by period of accounts receivable origination 
such reviews include the use of historical cash collection percentages by contract adjusted for the lapse of time since the date of the patient visit 
in addition  when actual collection percentages differ from expected results  on a contract by contract basis  supplemental detailed reviews of the outstanding accounts receivable balances may be performed by our billing operations to determine whether there are facts and circumstances existing that may cause a different conclusion as to the estimate of the collectibility of that contract s accounts receivable from the estimate resulting from using the historical collection experience 
contract related net revenue is billed based on the terms of the contract at amounts expected to be collected 
such billings are typically submitted on a monthly basis and aged trial balances prepared 
allowances for estimated uncollectible amounts related to such contract billings are made based upon specific accounts and invoice periodic reviews once it is concluded that such amounts are not likely to be collected 
the methodologies employed to compute allowances for doubtful accounts were unchanged between and insurance reserves the nature of our business is such that it is subject to professional liability claims and lawsuits 
historically  to mitigate a portion of this risk  we have maintained insurance for individual professional liability claims with per incident and annual aggregate limits per physician for all incidents 
prior to march   we obtained such insurance coverage from commercial insurance providers 
subsequent to march   we have provided 
table of contents for a significant portion of our professional liability loss exposures through the use of a captive insurance company and through greater utilization of self insurance reserves 
since march   the most significant cost element within our professional liability program has consisted of the actuarial estimates of losses by occurrence period 
in addition to the estimated actuarial losses  other costs that are considered by management in the estimation of professional liability costs include program costs such as brokerage fees  claims management expenses  program premiums and taxes  and other administrative costs of operating the program  such as the costs to operate the captive insurance subsidiary 
net costs in any period reflect our estimate of net losses to be incurred in that period as well as any changes to our estimates of the reserves established for net losses of prior periods 
our commercial insurance policy for professional liability losses for the period march  through march  included insured limits applicable to such coverage in the period 
effective april  we executed an agreement with the commercial insurance provider that issued the policy that ended march  to increase the existing million aggregate limit of coverage 
under the terms of the agreement  we will make periodic premium payments to the commercial insurance company and the total aggregate limit of coverage under the policy will be increased by a portion of the premiums paid 
we have committed to fund premiums such that the total aggregate limit of coverage under the program remains greater than the paid losses at any point in time 
during fiscal years and  we funded a total of million and million under this agreement 
for the year ended december   we funded a total of million and have agreed to fund additional payments  which will be based upon the level of incurred losses relative to the aggregate limit of coverage at that time 
as of december   the current aggregate limit of coverage under this policy was million and the estimated loss reserve for claim losses and expenses in excess of the current aggregate limit was million 
the accounts of the captive insurance company are fully consolidated with those of our other operations in the accompanying financial statements 
the estimation of medical professional liability losses is inherently complex 
medical professional liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often as long as ten years or more 
the combination of changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of judgment  and such estimates require periodic revision 
a report of actuarial loss estimates is prepared at least semi annually 
management s estimate of our professional liability costs resulting from such actuarial studies is significantly influenced by assumptions and assessments regarding expectations of several factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to historical paid and incurred loss development trends  hours of exposure as measured by hours of physician and related professional staff services  trends in the frequency and severity of claims  which can differ significantly by jurisdiction due to the legislative and judicial climate in such jurisdictions  coverage limits of third party insurance  the effectiveness of our claims management process  and the outcome of litigation 
as a result of the variety of factors that must be considered by management  there is a risk that actual incurred losses may develop differently from estimates 
the underlying information that serves as the foundational basis for making our actuarial estimates of professional liability losses is our internal database of incurred professional liability losses 
we have captured extensive professional liability loss data going back  in some cases  over twenty years  that is maintained and updated on an ongoing basis by our internal claims management personnel 
our database contains comprehensive incurred loss information for our existing operations as far back as fiscal year reflecting the initial timeframe in which we migrated to a consolidated professional liability program concurrent with the consummation of several significant acquisitions and  in addition  we possess additional loss data that predates dates of occurrence for certain of our operations 
loss information reflects both paid and reserved losses incurred when we were covered by outside commercial insurance programs as well as paid and reserved losses incurred under our self insurance program 
because of the comprehensive nature of the loss data and our comfort 
table of contents with the completeness and reliability of the loss data  this is the information that is used in the development of our actuarial loss estimates 
we believe this database is one of the largest repositories of physician professional liability loss information available in our industry and provides us and our actuarial consultants with sufficient data to develop reasonable estimates of the ultimate losses under our self insurance program 
in addition to the estimated losses  as part of the actuarial process  we obtain revised payment pattern assumptions that are based upon our historical loss and related claims payment experience 
such payment patterns reflect estimated cash outflows for aggregate incurred losses by period based upon the occurrence date of the loss as well as the report date of the loss 
although variances have been observed in the actuarial estimate of ultimate losses by occurrence period between actuarial studies  the estimated payment patterns have shown much more limited variability 
we use these payment patterns to develop our estimate of the discounted reserve amounts 
the relative consistency of the payment pattern estimates provides us with a foundation in which to develop a reasonable estimate of the discount value of the professional liability reserves based upon the most current estimate of ultimate losses to be paid and the reasonable likelihood of the related cash flows over the payment period 
as of december  and december   our estimated loss reserves were discounted at and  respectively  which was the current ten year us treasury rate at those dates  and which reflects the risk free interest rate over the expected period of claims payments 
in establishing our initial reserves for a given loss period  management considers the results of the actuarial loss estimates for such periods as well as assumptions regarding loss retention levels and other program costs to be incurred 
on a semi annual basis  we will review our professional liability reserves considering not only the reserves and loss estimates associated with the current period  but also the reserves established in prior periods based upon revised actuarial loss estimates 
the actuarial estimation process employed utilizes a frequency severity simulation model to estimate the ultimate cost of claims for each loss period 
the results of the simulation model are then validated by a comparison to the results from several different actuarial methods paid loss development  incurred loss development  incurred bornhuetter ferguson method  paid bornhuetter ferguson method for reasonableness 
each method contains assumptions regarding the underlying claims process 
actuarial loss estimates at various confidence levels capture the variability in the loss estimates for process risk but assume that the underlying model and assumptions are correct 
adjustments to professional liability loss reserves will be made as needed to reflect revised assumptions and emerging trends and data 
any adjustments to reserves are reflected in the current operations 
due to the size of our reserve for professional liability losses  even a small percentage adjustment to these estimates can have a material effect on the results of operations for the period in which the adjustment is made 
given the number of factors considered in establishing the reserves for professional liability losses  it is neither practical nor meaningful to isolate a particular assumption or parameter of the process and calculate the impact of changing that single item 
the actuarial reports provide a variety of loss estimates based upon statistical confidence levels reflecting the inherent uncertainty of the medical professional liability claims environment in which we operate 
initial year loss estimates are generally recorded using the actuarial expected loss estimate  but aggregate professional liability loss reserves may be carried at amounts in excess of the expected loss estimates provided by the actuarial reports due to the relatively short time period in which we have provided for our losses on a self insured basis and the expectation that we believe additional adjustments to prior year estimates may occur as our reporting history and loss portfolio matures 
in addition  we are subject to the risk of claims in excess of insured limits as well as unlimited aggregate risk of loss in certain loss periods 
as our self insurance program continues to mature and additional stability is noted in the loss development trends in the initial years of the program  we expect to continue to review and evaluate the carried level of reserves and make adjustments as needed 
based on the results of the actuarial study completed in april  we recorded a reduction in professional liability reserves associated with prior year loss estimates in the amount of million during the first quarter of of the total reserve reduction  approximately million was associated with loss estimates established in prior years for the self insurance program covering the loss occurrence periods from march  through december  the remaining reserve reduction of million was associated with the estimated losses in excess of the aggregate limit of coverage under the commercial insurance program that ended march  
table of contents the second semi annual report of actuarial loss estimates was completed in october based on these results  management determined no additional change was necessary in our consolidated reserves for professional liability losses as of december  related to prior year loss estimates 
the following reflects the current reserves for professional liability costs as of december  in millions as well as the sensitivity of the reserve estimates at a and confidence level as reported at confidence level at confidence level it is not possible to quantify the amount of the change in our estimate of prior year losses by individual fiscal period due to the nature of the professional liability loss estimates that are provided to us on an occurrence period basis and the nature of the coverage that is obtained in the commercial insurance market which is generally underwritten on a claims made or report period basis 
even though we are self insured for a significant portion of our risk  due to customer contracting requirements and state insurance regulations  we still  at times  must place coverage on a claims made or report period basis with commercial insurance carriers 
when evaluating the appropriate carrying level of our self insured professional liability reserves  management considers the current estimates of occurrence period loss estimates as well as how such loss estimates and related future claims will interact with previous or current commercial insurance programs when projecting future cash flows 
however  the complexity that is associated with multiple occurrence periods interacting with multiple report periods that contain risks and related reserves retained by us  as well as transferred to commercial insurance carriers  makes it impossible to allocate the change in prior year loss estimates to individual occurrence periods 
instead  we evaluate the future expected cash flows for all historical loss periods in the aggregate and compare such estimates to the current carrying value of our professional liability reserves 
this process provides the basis for us to conclude that our reserves for professional liability losses are reasonable and properly stated 
management considers the results of actuarial studies when estimating the appropriate level of professional liability reserves and no adjustments to prior year loss estimates were made in periods where updated actuarial loss estimates were not available 
contributing to the reduction in professional liability reserves associated with prior years recognized in the first quarter of were improvements in the estimate of ultimate losses by occurrence periods contained in the actuarial report received in april the april actuarial report reflected a reduction in the estimated ultimate undiscounted losses by occurrence period of between and at various confidence factors for the self insured loss period from march  through december  the april actuarial report also reflected a reduction in the estimated undiscounted losses of between and at various confidence factors for our exposure in excess of the aggregate limit of coverage in place on the commercial insurance program that ended march  due to the complexity of the actuarial estimation process  there are many factors  trends  and assumptions that must be considered in the development of the actuarial loss estimates and we are not able to quantify and disclose which specific elements are primarily contributing to the overall favorable development in the revised loss estimates of historical occurrence periods 
however  we believe that our internal investments in enhanced risk management and claims management resources and initiatives  such as the employment of additional claims and litigation management personnel and practices and an expansion of programs such as root cause loss analysis  early claim evaluation  and litigation support for insured providers  as well as the improved legal environment resulting from professional liability tort reform efforts in certain key jurisdictions such as florida and texas have contributed to the favorable trend in loss development estimates noted during the prior year occurrence periods 
impairment of intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
specifically  in estimating the 
table of contents fair value of a reporting unit  we use valuation techniques based on the historical and expected future performance of the specific reporting units and the current valuation multiples of entities that have comparable operations and economic characteristics 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
in december  we recorded an impairment loss of million related to million of goodwill for our after hours pediatric unit and million of goodwill for our radiology reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment charge was based upon a combination of current market valuations and management s assessment of the projected operating performance of the operations 
following the impairment charge  there was no remaining recorded goodwill associated with these reporting units 
in december we recognized a non tax deductible charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill associated with our military staffing division 
following the charge there is approximately million of remaining goodwill associated with this division 
the decline in carrying value and resulting goodwill impairment charge resulted from our annual impairment test results and reflects the decline in the military s financial performance and the impact of the more challenging government contracting environment 
also in june  we recorded an impairment loss of million associated with a contractual relationship acquired in prior years whose expected term was less than initially estimated 
the remaining reporting units that have recorded goodwill  based on the results of our annual impairment test  are not considered to be at risk as of december  the results of step one of the annual impairment test completed as of december   and as prescribed by the provisions of asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  which is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill  indicated that the fair value of each reporting unit that has remaining recorded goodwill exceeded its carrying value by more than 
results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the operating results of the periods presented were not significantly affected by general inflation in the us economy 
net revenue less the provision for uncollectibles is an estimate of future cash collections and as such it is a key measurement by which management evaluates performance of individual contracts as well as our company as a whole 
the following table sets forth the components of net earnings as a percentage of net revenue less provision for uncollectibles for the periods indicated year ended december  net revenue less provision for uncollectibles professional services expenses professional liability costs general and administrative expenses other expenses income impairment of intangibles depreciation and amortization interest expense  net gain loss on extinguishment of debt transaction costs earnings before income taxes provision for income taxes net earnings 
table of contents year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenue

the increase in fee for service revenue was a result of increases in estimated collections per billed visit and a increase in total fee for service visits and procedures 
estimated collections per visit increased due to annual increases in gross charges  managed care pricing  increases in average patient acuity levels  and revenue cycle improvements 
the decrease in contract revenue was due primarily to declines in our military staffing  locums tenens and radiology operations associated with contracting changes within the military and reductions in temporary staffing and teleradiology volumes  respectively

factors contributing to the change in prior year loss estimates included favorable loss development on historical periods between actuarial studies as well as favorable trends in the frequency and severity of claims reported compared to historical trends 
we believe that both internal initiatives in the areas of patient safety  risk management and claims management  as well as external factors such as tort reform in certain key states  continue to contribute to these favorable trends in prior year loss estimates 
excluding the favorable actuarial adjustments in both periods  professional liability costs increased million  or  between periods

depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense was million in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million between periods was primarily due to increased amortization expense associated with acquisitions completed in and and higher depreciation expense related to an increase in capital expenditures

transaction costs 
transaction costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  these costs relate to advisory  legal  accounting and other fees incurred related to acquisition activity during the period 
the reduction in costs between periods was due to a terminated acquisition effort during impairment of intangibles 
during  we recorded an impairment loss totaling million of which million relates to the impairment of goodwill associated with our military division and million that was associated with a contractual relationship acquired in prior years whose term was less than initially estimated

contributing to the increase in fee for service visits and procedures were approximately  visits and procedures on a same contract basis and approximately  visits and procedures from new and acquired contracts  net of terminations 
same contract visits and procedures for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior period 
while period over period volume growth was flat to negative in the early part of the year  beginning in the second quarter  we experienced volume growth that was in excess of recent historical growth levels 
we believe that a portion of such elevated volume growth was a result of an increase in reported cases of flu attributed to the hn virus  although we cannot quantify the exact impact of this condition on our volume growth 
as reported cases of the hn virus subside in future periods  we anticipate that same contract volume growth will revert back to more normalized levels as observed in historical period over period growth rates 
estimated collections per visit increased due to annual increases in gross charges and managed care pricing improvements  in addition to improved medicare pricing and other valuation adjustments between periods 
the decrease in contract revenue was due primarily to declines in our military staffing  locums tenens and radiology operations associated with contracting changes within the military and reductions in temporary staffing and teleradiology volumes  respectively

we believe that our cash needs  other than for significant acquisitions  will continue to be met through the use of existing available cash  cash flows derived from future operating results and cash generated from borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  increased to million compared to million in the corresponding period in included within operating cash flow in were cash costs associated with the bond redemption while operating cash flow reflects cash costs associated with the ipo 
cash used in investing activities in the year ended december  was million compared to million in the same period of the million decrease in cash used in investing activities was principally due to a decrease in cash payments made related to acquisitions 
cash used in financing activities in the year ended december  was million compared to cash provided by operations of million in the year ended december  the change in cash used in financing is due to the redemption of million of our senior subordinated notes the notes in and equity proceeds associated with our initial public offering in we spent million in and million in for capital expenditures

we are highly leveraged 
as of december   we had million in aggregate indebtedness  consisting of our term loan with an additional million of borrowing capacity available under our senior secured revolving credit facility without giving effect to million of undrawn letters of credit 
during  we redeemed all of our million outstanding notes utilizing the net proceeds from our initial public offering and existing cash 
we previously retired million of the notes in an open market purchase in december we amended our senior secured credit agreement effective december  as part of the amendment  lenders holding million of commitments in the aggregate under the revolving credit facility agreed to extend the maturity date of their commitments to august  outstanding term loan borrowings under the senior credit facility mature on november  
table of contents the senior credit facility agreement  as amended  contain both affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  sell material assets  retire  redeem or otherwise reacquire our capital stock  acquire the capital stock or assets of another business  pay dividends  and require us to comply with certain coverage and leverage ratios 
the amendment also provides additional flexibility under certain of our covenants  including permitting us to make additional investments  loans and advances and to incur additional earn out obligations in connection with permitted acquisitions 
the senior credit agreement also includes a provision for the prepayment of a portion of the outstanding term loan amounts at any year end if we generate excess cash flow  as defined in the agreement 
we entered into three separate forward interest rate swap agreements during the objective of these agreements is to eliminate the variability of the cash flows in interest payments for million of the variable rate senior secured term loan facility for a three year period 
the agreements are contracts to exchange  on a quarterly basis  floating interest rate payments based on the eurocurrency rate  for fixed interest payments over the life of the agreements 
we have determined that the interest rate swaps are highly effective and qualify for hedge accounting  therefore for the year ended december   we recorded the increase in the fair value of the interest rate swaps  net of tax  of approximately million as a component of other comprehensive earnings 
the increase in fair value of the interest rate swaps  net of tax  of approximately million as a component of other comprehensive earnings was recorded during as of december  and  we had a million and million liability recorded related to the swaps  respectively 
these agreements expose us to credit losses in the event of non performance by the counterparty to the financial instruments 
the counterparty is a creditworthy financial institution  and we believe the counterparty will be able to fully satisfy its obligations under the contracts 
subject to any contractual restrictions  we and our subsidiaries  affiliates or significant stockholders including the sponsor and its affiliates may from time to time  in their sole discretion  purchase  repay  redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt or equity securities including any publicly issued debt or equity securities  in privately negotiated or open market transactions  by tender offer or otherwise

maximum future contingent payment obligations are million as of december  
table of contents we are in discussions with certain physician staffing businesses regarding potential acquisition opportunities 
if we consummate these potential acquisitions  we would expect to fund such acquisitions using our existing cash  through borrowings under our revolving credit facility  or the issuance of new debt or equity 
effective march   we began providing for professional liability risks in part through a captive insurance company 
prior to such date we insured such risks principally through the commercial insurance market 
the change in the professional liability insurance program initially resulted in increased cash flow due to the retention of cash formerly paid out in the form of insurance premiums to a commercial insurance company coupled with a long period typically years or longer on average before cash payout of such losses occurs 
a portion of such cash retained is retained within our captive insurance company and therefore not immediately available for general corporate purposes 
as of december   the current value of cash or cash equivalents and related investments held within the captive insurance company totaled million 
investments of captive insurance are carried at fair market value and as of december   reflected million of net unrealized gains 
effective june   we renewed our fronting carrier program with a commercial insurance carrier through may  in connection with this renewal  we have paid cash premiums of million to the commercial insurance carrier

adjusted ebitda under the indenture that governed the senior subordinated notes was defined as net earnings before interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as further adjusted to exclude unusual items  non cash items and the other adjustments shown in the table below 
we believe that the disclosure of the calculation of adjusted ebitda provides information that is useful to an investor s understanding of our financial flexibility 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance or liquidity under generally accepted accounting principles

inflation we do not believe that general inflation in the us economy has had a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
seasonality historically  our revenues and operating results have reflected minimal seasonal variation due to the significance of revenues derived from patient visits to eds  which are generally open on a day basis  and also due to our geographic diversification 
revenue from our non ed staffing lines is dependent on a healthcare facility being open during selected time periods 
revenue in such instances will fluctuate depending upon such factors as the number of holidays in the period 
recently issued accounting standards see note of the consolidated financial statements included in this form k for a discussion of recently issued accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities 
interest rate swap agreements are used to manage a portion of our interest rate exposure 
at december   the fair value of our total debt  which had a carrying value of million  was million 
at december   the fair value of our total debt  which had a carrying value of million  was million 
we had million of variable debt outstanding at december  and if the market interest rates for our variable rate borrowings had averaged more subsequent to december  and  our interest expense excluding the impact of our interest rate swap agreements would have increased  and earnings before income taxes would have decreased  by approximately million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  and this analysis does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  management could take actions in an attempt to further mitigate its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our financial structure
