item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report and also with certain risks in item of this report 
certain amounts in prior years financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the financial statement presentation 
this discussion also includes forward looking statements 
please refer to cautionary information about forward looking statements in part i of this report for important information about these types of statements 
overview we are an independent oil and gas exploration and production company with operations entirely located in the united states 
we have determined that our business is comprised of only one segment because our gathering  processing and marketing activities are ancillary to our production operations and are not separately managed 

table of contents our operating strategy is to achieve profitable growth in proved reserves and production primarily through exploration and development 
to supplement our growth and to provide for new drilling opportunities  we also consider mergers and property acquisitions 
our growth is generally funded with cash flow provided by our operating activities 
in order to achieve a consistent rate of growth and mitigate risk we have historically maintained a blended portfolio of low  moderate  and higher risk exploration and development projects 
to further mitigate risk  we have chosen to seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins 
our operations are mainly conducted in texas  oklahoma and new mexico 
we also have projects in kansas and wyoming 
our revenue  profitability and future growth are highly dependent on the commodity prices we receive 
continued volatility in commodity prices  and a recurrence of turmoil in the global financial system may have adverse effects on our business and financial position 
our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
further  the global economic situation could have an impact on our lenders  business partners and customers  potentially causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
our ability to find  develop and or acquire proved oil and gas reserves will also impact our financial results 
a cornerstone to our approach is a detailed evaluation of each drilling decision based on its risk adjusted discounted cash flow rate of return on investment 
our analysis includes estimates and assessments of potential reserve size  geologic and mechanical risks  expected costs  future production profiles and future oil and gas prices 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of our reported assets  liabilities  equity and proved reserves 
we use the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas activities 
summary for the year ended december   net income totaled million  or per diluted share 
this compares to a loss of million  or per share for cash flow provided by operating activities totaled billion  up from million in our proved reserves grew and our production volume increased 
we anticipate production growth of for our drilling activities have been conducted in three main areas permian basin  mid continent and gulf coast 
we drilled and completed gross net wells during  and at year end we had operated rigs running 
summary operating and financial results proved reserves increased to tcfe  up from tcfe in daily production volumes increased to mmcfe d  up from mmcfe d for oil  gas and ngl sales increased to billion compared to million a year earlier 
our average realized oil price increased to per barrel compared to per barrel in our average realized gas price increased to per mcf versus per mcf in average realized ngl prices decreased to per barrel compared to per barrel in total debt decreased by million to million compared to million at year end 
table of contents cash and cash equivalents totaled million at december   up from million at the end of in response to higher oil and gas prices we significantly increased our exploration and development capital expenditures 
in our exploration and development expenditures were million 
total expenditures for were million 
in october our bank group  as part of its regularly scheduled fall review  reaffirmed our billion borrowing base related to our credit facility 
bank group commitments to lend up to million also remain unchanged 
at december   we did not have any bank borrowings outstanding 
at december  we had bank borrowings outstanding of million 
during we made property acquisitions of million  primarily for additional interests in our western oklahoma  cana woodford shale play 
we made no significant acquisitions during during we sold oil and gas properties for million  most of which were located in mississippi 
in we sold various non core properties for million  the largest of which was a west texas secondary oil recovery field 
commodity prices while our revenues are a function of both production and prices  wide swings in commodity prices have had the greatest impact on our results of operations 
commodity prices reached historically high levels during the first nine months of however  during the fourth quarter of  severe disruptions in the credit markets and reductions in global economic activity and energy demand caused significant decreases in commodity prices 
year end prices fell from their mid peak 
as unfolded  oil and ngl prices improved  but they remained well below prior year levels 
the downward pressure on natural gas prices continued in  resulting in an average realized price lower than that of oil prices have continued to improve during  as the us and global economic situation have improved 
however  there is still significant volatility as a result of concerns about sustained economic growth and geopolitical instability 
prices for natural gas have remained low  primarily as a result of an oversupply 
the following table presents our average realized commodity prices for the years ended  and years ended december  gas prices average henry hub price mcf average realized sales price mcf effect of hedges mcf oil prices average wti cushing price bbl average realized sales price bbl ngl prices average realized sales price bbl 
table of contents on an energy equivalent basis  of our aggregate production was natural gas 
a per mcf change in our average realized gas sales price would have resulted in a million change in our gas revenues 
similarly  of our production was crude oil and ngl 
a per barrel change in our average realized sales price would have resulted in a million change in our oil and ngl revenues 
hedging in addition to supply and demand  oil and gas prices are affected by seasonal  economic and geo political factors that we can neither control nor predict 
from time to time we attempt to mitigate a portion of our price risk through the use of hedging transactions 
in we entered into derivative contracts covering approximately of our anticipated oil and gas production volumes 
these contracts were settled in for a net gain of million 
during we entered into oil and gas contracts relative to our production which equate to approximately to of our anticipated oil production and to of projected gas production 
management has been authorized to hedge up to of our anticipated equivalent production 
at december   we had the following outstanding contracts natural gas contracts weighted average price period type volume day index swap jan dec swap  mmbtu pepl oil contracts weighted average price period type volume day index floor ceiling jan dec collar  bbls wti pepl refers to panhandle eastern pipe line company price as quoted in platt inside ferc on the first business day of each month 
wti refers to west texas intermediate price as quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
depending on changes in oil and gas futures markets and management view of underlying supply and demand trends  we may increase or decrease our current hedging positions 
we have chosen not to apply hedge accounting treatment to any of the derivative contracts we entered into in and therefore  settlements on these contracts do not impact our realized commodity prices during the periods they cover 
instead  any settlements on the contracts are shown as a component of operating costs and expenses as either a net gain or loss on derivative instruments 
see item a and note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 
reserve replacement and growth oil and gas are non renewable forms of energy resources 
therefore  exploration and production companies face the challenge of resource depletion and natural production decline 
for most years our primary source of reserve replacement and growth is exploration and development e d 
our e d expenditures are generally funded with cash flow provided by operating activities 
a cornerstone of our approach to reserve replacement is a detailed evaluation of each drilling decision based on its risk adjusted discounted cash flow rate of return on investment 
we analyze and project potential reserve size  geologic and mechanical risks  expected costs  future production profiles and 
table of contents future commodity prices 
our operations entail significant complexities that require the use of advanced technologies and highly trained personnel 
even when modern exploration technology is properly used  our geo scientists still may not know conclusively if hydrocarbons will be present  the rate at which they will be produced  or economic viability 
in order to achieve a consistent rate of growth and mitigate risk we have historically maintained a blended portfolio of low  moderate  and higher risk e d projects 
to further mitigate risk  we have chosen to seek geologic and geographic diversification by operating in multiple basins 
our e d capital expenditures for totaled million 
approximately of our expenditures were in our mid continent region  in the permian basin and in our gulf coast region 
cash flow from operating activities for totaled billion  which more than funded our drilling program 
year end proved reserves grew to trillion cubic feet equivalent tcfe  up from tcfe at year end reserve additions were comprised of oil and ngl and gas  resulting in proved reserves going from gas at year end to at year end proved reserves are developed for both year end and year end the increase in proved reserves is net of production of billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe and property sales of bcfe 
reserves added from e d totaled bcfe and bcfe were acquired via property purchases 
net revisions added bcfe  which included bcfe driven by higher commodity prices 
the rest of the increase relates primarily to increases in our ngl volumes 
the determination of whether to record ngl production volumes is based on where title transfer occurs 
ongoing contractual amendments together with increased gas production volumes with high ngl content have contributed to higher estimated ngl reserves 
overall  approximately of our proved reserves are in our mid continent region and are in the permian basin 
our onshore gulf coast and other onshore operations collectively make up another of total proved reserves 
less than of our total proved reserves are in the gulf of mexico 
we expect our e d capital expenditures to be principally funded from cash flow 
based on current market prices and service costs  we expect that e d expenditures may range from to billion 
at year end we have a large inventory of drilling opportunities and limited lease expirations 
our future growth will continue to depend upon our ability to economically add reserves in excess of production 
there is strong competition in all sectors of the oil and gas industry 
we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of oil and gas leases and properties 
we also compete for the equipment and personnel required to explore  develop and operate properties 
strong competition also exists in the marketing of oil  ngl and gas 
higher commodity prices will generally increase the costs of properties available for acquisition 
many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours 
as a consequence  we could be at a competitive disadvantage in conducting our business 
to assure timely execution of our drilling program we occasionally enter into contractual arrangements with certain service providers to secure equipment and supplies for future periods 
our business is subject to extensive federal  state and local rules and regulations  some of which have substantial penalties for failure to comply 
changes in public policy could affect the profitability of our operations and our ability to economically replace reserves 
see item of this report for further information regarding government regulations 
the process of estimating quantities of oil  gas and ngl reserves is complex 
significant decisions are required in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but 
table of contents not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history  contractual arrangements and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that our reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  subjective decisions and available data for our various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in financial statement disclosures 
see note  unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures for more reserve information 
production and other operating expenses the costs associated with finding and producing oil and gas are substantial 
some of these costs vary with oil and gas prices  some trend with production volume and some are a function of the number of wells we own 
at the end of  we owned interests in  gross wells 
production expense generally consists of the cost of power and fuel  direct labor  third party field services  compression  water disposal  and certain maintenance activity necessary to produce oil and gas from existing wells 
transportation expense is comprised of costs paid to move oil and gas from the wellhead to a specified sales point 
in some cases we receive a payment from purchasers which is net of transportation costs  and in other instances we separately pay for transportation 
if costs are netted in the proceeds received  both the gross revenues and gross costs are shown in sales and expenses  respectively 
depreciation  depletion  and amortization dd a of our producing properties is computed using the units of production method 
because the economic life of each producing well depends upon the assumed price for future sales of production  fluctuations in oil and gas prices may impact the level of proved reserves used in the calculation 
higher prices generally have the effect of increasing reserves  which reduces depletion expense  while lower prices generally have the effect of decreasing reserves  which increases depletion expense 
in addition  changes in estimates of reserve quantities and estimates of future development costs or reclassifications from unproved properties to proved properties will impact depletion expense 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related benefits  office rent  legal fees  consultants  systems costs and other administrative costs incurred in our offices and not directly associated with exploration  development or production activities 
while we expect these costs to increase with our growth  we also expect such increases to be proportionately smaller than our production growth 
production taxes are assessed by state and local taxing authorities pertaining to production  revenues or the value of properties 
these typically include production severance  ad valorem  and excise taxes 
significant expenses that generally do not trend with production stock compensation expense consists of non cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock options 
in accordance with our stock incentive plan  such grants are periodically made to non employee directors  officers and other eligible employees 
the net gain or loss on derivative instruments is the net realized and unrealized gain or loss on derivative contracts  to which we did not apply hedge accounting treatment 
that amount will fluctuate based on changes in the fair values of the underlying commodities 
results of operations compared to for the year ended december   net income totaled million  or per diluted share 
this compares to a net loss of million  or per share for the increase in net income 
table of contents results from increased production and the improvement of realized oil and gas prices 
in addition  in we recorded a million non cash full cost ceiling write down  which was the main reason for the net loss in these changes are discussed further in the analysis that follows

the remainder of the increase was due to higher realized oil and gas prices  which had a positive impact of million 
our full year gas production averaged mmcf per day  compared to mmcf per day for this increase resulted in million of incremental revenue for during the fourth quarter of our daily gas production averaged mmcf per day  up slightly from mmcf per day for the fourth quarter of this increase contributed million of additional revenues for the fourth quarter of oil production for averaged  barrels per day 
for our average daily oil production was  barrels per day 
the year over year increase of in daily production contributed an additional million of revenue for the year 
our fourth quarter oil production averaged  barrels per day  or an increase of compared to average daily production of  barrels for the fourth quarter of the higher production in the fourth quarter of increased oil sales by million 
during we began separately reporting ngl volumes 
the determination of whether to record and separately disclose ngl volumes is based on where title transfer occurs during processing of the well stream 
new gas processing contracts and certain contractual amendments resulted in title of ngl volumes transferring to the company 
our average daily ngl production volumes were  barrels per day 
this compares to average daily ngl volumes for all of of barrels per day 
the higher production volumes in contributed an additional million of revenue 
for the fourth quarter of our average daily ngl production was  barrels per day  up from barrels per day during the fourth quarter of this increase provided an additional million of revenue in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents overall  increases in our production volumes primarily reflect positive drilling results in our western oklahoma cana woodford shale play  our permian basin oil programs and our yegua cook mountain play in southeast texas 
our average realized gas price for increased by to per mcf  compared to per mcf in this price increase contributed million to gas sales in during the fourth quarter of our average realized gas price fell to per mcf 
for the same period of  we realized an average price per mcf of 
the decrease in prices received in the fourth quarter of resulted in million less in gas sales compared to the same period of realized oil prices during all of averaged per barrel  an increase of over the average price received for oil in of per barrel 
this increase resulted in an additional million of oil sales in for the fourth quarter of our average realized oil price was per barrel versus per barrel received in the fourth quarter of the increase in fourth quarter oil sales due to the increase in oil prices totaled million 
during our ngl average realized price was per barrel 
in we realized per barrel 
the drop in realized price resulted in a decrease of million for ngl sales in for the fourth quarter of our average realized price for ngl was per barrel  or less than the average realized price of per barrel received for the same period of the decrease in fourth quarter ngl sales attributed to the decline in price was million 
increases and decreases in realized commodity prices were the result of supply and demand factors and overall market conditions 
there continues to be significant upward volatility in oil prices stemming from concerns about sustained economic growth and geopolitical instability

operating costs and expenses for compared to costs of million excluding the million impairment increased by million  or 
analyses of the year over year differences are discussed below 
dd a increased million from million in to million in on a unit of production basis  dd a was per mcfe in compared to per mcfe for the lower dd a rate was a result of impairments to the carrying value of our oil and gas properties recorded during the last half of and the first quarter of the decrease in expense resulting from the decrease in the dd a rate per mcfe was more than offset by increased expense related to higher production volumes for asset retirement obligation expense declined from million in to million in the decrease was primarily due to certain plugging and abandonment costs in that exceeded our original asset retirement obligation estimates 
this occurred because of hurricane damage to our offshore properties which caused additional expenses to be incurred during site restoration 
our production costs consist of lease operating expense and workover expense 
our aggregate costs for of million were higher than aggregate costs of million 
approximately of the aggregate increase relates to higher operating expense associated primarily with new wells we ve drilled in and our workover expenditures in accounted for the remainder of the increase 
our average cost per mcfe decreased  from per mcfe in to per mcfe in the decrease in rate resulted from our continued focus on efficiencies in production operations 
however  we expect to see our production cost per mcfe begin to trend upward  due to expected increases in certain service costs 

table of contents transportation costs rose to million per mcfe for from million per mcfe in transportation costs will fluctuate based on increases or decreases in sales volumes and fluctuation in the price of the fuel cost component 
also  during we recorded million of well connection reimbursement costs 
these costs resulted from a failure to meet minimum volume delivery commitments entered into in prior years 
taxes other than income increased million from million in to million in the increased taxes resulted from increases in production volumes and from higher realized commodity prices in our general and administrative expense was million in compared to million for the million increase is mostly due to higher costs associated with employee benefits  including bonus and profit sharing expenses  in stock compensation expense  net consists of non cash charges resulting from the issuance of restricted stock  restricted stock units and stock option awards  net of amounts capitalized 
net stock compensation expense in was million compared to million in expense associated with stock compensation will fluctuate based on the grant date market value of the award and the number of awards granted 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for a detailed discussion regarding our stock based compensation 
our net gain or loss on derivative instruments includes both realized gains and losses on settlements of our derivative contracts and unrealized gains and losses stemming from changes in the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments 
we estimate the fair values of these instruments based on published forward commodity price curves for the underlying commodity as of the date of the estimate 
for collars  we estimate the option value of the contract floors and ceilings using an option pricing model which takes into account market volatility  market prices and contract terms 
the fair values of our derivative instruments in an asset position include a measure of counterparty credit risk  and the fair values of instruments in a liability position include a measure of our own nonperformance risk 
these credit risks are based on current published credit default swap rates 
we did not elect hedge accounting treatment for derivative contracts that we entered into in and see note to the consolidated financial statements in this report for a complete discussion of our derivative instruments 
the following table reflects the net realized and unrealized gains and losses on our derivative instruments for the years ended december  in thousands realized gain loss on settlement of derivative instruments unrealized gain loss from changes to the fair value of the derivative instruments gain loss on derivative instruments  net other operating  net consists of costs related to various legal matters  most of which pertain to litigation and contract settlements and title and royalty issues 
our other operating net costs decreased from million in to million for the decrease was mainly a result of less litigation accruals and fewer contract settlements in and the favorable resolution of items in that had been accrued for in prior years 
for further information on litigation matters please see contingencies under critical accounting policies and estimates in this report 

table of contents other income and expense our interest expense was million compared to million for the million decrease resulted from lower average bank debt outstanding during compared to during we only had bank borrowings outstanding in the first quarter of the year 
this resulted in average daily bank debt outstanding of million for during our average daily bank debt outstanding was million 
capitalized interest for increased by million to million  compared to million in the increase results from more costs associated with our unproved properties and construction project in and a higher average interest rate for versus in july of  holders of our floating rate convertible senior notes elected to convert their notes for cash and shares of our common stock 
we recorded a gain of million on the early extinguishment of the notes

components of other  net consist of miscellaneous income and expense items that will vary from period to period  including  gain or loss on the sale or value of oil and gas well equipment  interest income  and income or loss from equity investees 
other  net increased from million of expense in to million of income in approximately of the million change from to is attributable to losses in related to oil and gas well equipment 
in the value of drill pipe decreased due to the significant slowing of drilling activity across the industry 
another of the change resulted from gains on fixed asset sales during income tax for the year ended december   we recognized net income tax expense of million of which million is current 
this compares with a net income tax benefit of million including a current tax benefit of million 
the combined federal and state effective income tax rates were for and for the effective tax rate of for differs from the statutory rate of due to the effects of state income taxes  the domestic production activities allowance and other permanent differences 
results of operations compared to we recognized a net loss for of million or per share

table of contents obligation estimates 
this was primarily the result of hurricane damage to our offshore properties 
this caused additional expenses to be incurred during site restoration 
production costs decreased million  or  from million per mcfe in to million per mcfe in our production costs consist of workover expense and lease operating expenses 
we have seen a decrease in costs in both of these areas 
a reduction in large scale workover projects caused a million decrease 
a decrease in lease operating expense of million is attributable to the sale of producing properties in the last half of and early coupled with a significant decline in service costs in comparison to their peak in mid transportation costs decreased from million in to million in the decrease is the result of lower sales volumes and lower fuel costs from to taxes other than income were million lower  dropping from million in to million in the decrease between periods resulted from decreases in oil and gas sales stemming from significantly lower commodity prices and lower gas production volumes

other operating  net expense consists of costs related to various legal matters most of which pertain to litigation and contract settlements and title and royalty issues 
in  the decrease in other operating  net to million from million was primarily related to the tulsa county district court issuing a judgment in the hb krug case in the total accrued litigation expense for the year ended december  for this lawsuit was million 
we have appealed the district court judgments 
for further information on this lawsuit and other litigation please see contingencies under critical accounting policies and estimates 
other income and expense interest expense increased by million  or  primarily because of an increase in our average bank debt outstanding during the year 
we had no borrowings on our credit facility during the first eleven months of and an average outstanding balance of approximately million during also  in comparison to  we recognized an additional million of deferred financing costs 
these higher costs are the result of the new credit facility we entered into in april partially offsetting these increases is a million decrease in interest expense on our convertible notes due to the december repurchases of million of the outstanding million face value notes 
we repurchased the notes with borrowings under our credit facility and recognized a million loss on early extinguishment of debt in 
table of contents capitalized interest increased by million due mostly to more costs associated with our unproved properties and construction project in other  net decreased from million of income in to million of expense in components consist of miscellaneous income and expense items that will vary from period to period  including income and loss in equity investees  gain or loss on the sale or value of oil and gas well equipment  and interest income 
the change from to is primarily the result of losses of million related to oil and gas well equipment due to decreased value of drill pipe resulting from a significant slowing of drilling activity across the industry

also included in our expense is a million loss on the sale of an equity investment 
income tax during  a net deferred income tax benefit of million was recognized the year end deferred tax benefit included million of current income tax benefit 
this compares with a net deferred income tax benefit of million 
the combined federal and state effective income tax rates were and in the years of and  respectively 
the effective tax rate of for differs from the statutory rate primarily due to the effects of state income taxes and the domestic production activities allowance 
liquidity and capital resources overview our liquidity is highly dependent on the commodity prices we receive 
oil and gas markets are very volatile and we cannot predict future commodity prices 
the prices we receive for our production heavily influence our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
during the united states and global economy have shown improvement 
however  concerns about a recurrence of turmoil in the global financial system and geopolitical instability have continued to impact commodity prices  particularly the price of oil 
prices for natural gas have continued to be depressed  primarily as a result of an oversupply of natural gas coupled with lower demand 
volatility in commodity prices may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can economically produce and affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures 
disruptions in economic conditions may impact third parties with whom we do business  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us 
we intend to deal with volatility in the current economic environment by maintaining a blended portfolio of low  moderate and higher risk exploration and development projects 
our drilling activities are currently being conducted in three main areas the permian basin  mid continent and gulf coast 
our permian activity is directed primarily to the delaware basin of southeast new mexico and west texas 
the majority of our mid continent drilling is in the western oklahoma cana woodford shale and texas panhandle granite wash 
our gulf coast operations are currently focused in southeast texas  near beaumont 
historically our exploration and development expenditures have generally been funded by cash flow provided by operating activities operating cash flow 
during we have continued to fund our exploration and development expenditures with operating cash flow 
we also intend to continue to use debt sparingly and hedge a portion of our production  to protect our operating cash flow for reinvestment 
from time to time we consider attractive acquisition opportunities 
however  the timing and size of acquisitions are unpredictable 
to prepare ourselves for potential acquisitions and potential declines in commodity prices  we have a three year senior secured revolving credit facility 
the credit facility provides for bank commitments of million with a borrowing base of billion 

table of contents at december   our total debt outstanding was million  which is comprised of our notes due in our debt to total capitalization ratio at year end was 
the reconciliation of debt to total capitalization  which is a non gaap measure  is long term debt of million divided by long term debt of million plus stockholders equity of billion 
management believes that this non gaap measure is useful information for investors because it is a common statistic referred to by the investment community  used to identify the amount of our leverage and to help analyze our risk exposure relative to other companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry 
we believe that our operating cash flow and other capital resources will be adequate to continue to meet our needs for our planned capital expenditures  working capital  debt servicing  and dividend payments for and beyond 
sources and uses of cash our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are cash flow from operating activities  occasional property sales  borrowings under our bank credit facility and public offerings of debt securities 
our primary uses of funds are exploration  development and other capital expenditures  property acquisitions  common stock dividends and occasional share repurchases 
the following table presents the sources and uses of our cash and cash equivalents from to the table presents capital expenditures on a cash basis 
these amounts differ from the amounts of capital expenditures including accruals that are referred to elsewhere in this document

the increase in cash flow used in investing activities from to was mostly from increased oil and gas expenditures resulting from a more active drilling program in also  we had million less proceeds from asset sales in compared to the decrease from to was primarily a result of decreased oil and gas expenditures 
in response to the lower oil and gas prices at the end of  we significantly reduced our planned capital expenditures from our record high in in addition  had million more proceeds from asset sales than there were in net cash flow used in financing activities in was million compared to million in in we had net cash flow provided by financing activities of million

also in we made dividend payments of million and used million of the borrowings under our credit facility to repurchase a portion of our convertible notes 
reconciliation of cash flow from operations for the year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities change in operating assets and liabilities cash flow from operations management believes that the non gaap measure of cash flow from operations is useful information for investors because it is used internally and is accepted by the investment community as a means of measuring the company ability to fund its capital program 
it is also used by professional research analysts in providing investment recommendations pertaining to companies in the oil and gas exploration and production industry 

table of contents capital expenditures the following table sets forth certain historical information regarding capitalized expenditures for our oil and gas acquisition  exploration and development activities and property sales in thousands for years ended december  acquisitions proved unproved exploration and development land seismic exploration development property sales the negative balance reflects purchase price adjustments related to an acreage acquisition in the fourth quarter of capital expenditures in the table above are presented on an accrual basis 
additions to property and equipment in the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report reflect capital expenditures on a cash basis  when payments are made 
our exploration and development expenditures increased in compared to the lower expenditures in compared to both and resulted from a planned decrease in our exploration and development activity in response to significantly lower commodity prices in and our continued efforts to operate within our cash flow provided by operating activities 
during we drilled and completed gross net wells  versus gross net wells in during we drilled and completed gross net wells 
at year end we had operated rigs running  compared to at the end of and at the end of our planned exploration and development program for is expected to be principally funded from cash flow 
based on current market prices and services costs  our capital expenditures may range from to billion 
although our capital budget is set at a level that we believe corresponds with our anticipated cash flows  the timing of capital expenditures and the receipt of cash flows do not necessarily match 
for example  our planned capital expenditures are front end loaded and we may outspend cash flows for a period of time 
therefore  we may borrow and repay funds under our credit arrangement throughout the year 
should we start to see a significant change in commodity prices from our current forecasts  we have the operational flexibility to increase or decrease our capital expenditures for changes in our expected cash flows from operations 
during we had property acquisitions of million  primarily for additional interests in our western oklahoma  cana woodford shale play 
of this total amount  million was for proved properties 
the remainder was for undeveloped acreage 
in we also had land and seismic purchases of million  of which was in the permian basin 
we made no significant property acquisitions in in  of our million of acquisitions were for producing properties and exploratory nonproducing leases in our western oklahoma  cana woodford shale play 
we intend to continue to 
table of contents actively evaluate acquisitions and dispositions relative to our property holdings  particularly in our core areas of operation 
we have a large development project in sublette county  wyoming where we are developing the deep madison gas formation and constructing a gas processing plant 
the total cost of the project will approximate million 
pursuant to the terms of our operating agreement with our partner in this project  we are reimbursed by them for of the costs 
through december  our cumulative share of the investment in this project is approximately million  of which million is included in our fixed assets 
we expect to initiate gas sales from this project in various interests in oil and gas properties were sold during for million  most of which were our non core mississippi assets 
during we sold various interests in non core oil and gas properties for million 
approximately of the sales were our westbrook field interests in our permian basin region 
in our property sales of million were for our word field holdings in our gulf coast region 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures to comply with environmental and safety regulations and requirements 
these costs are considered a normal recurring cost of our ongoing operations and not an extraordinary cost of compliance 
we do not anticipate that we will be required to expend amounts that will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or operations  nor are we aware of any pending regulatory changes that would have a material impact 
our exploration and development drilling program is discussed in more detail in exploration and development activity overview under item of this report 
financial condition future cash flows and the availability of financing will be subject to a number of variables  such as our success in locating and producing new reserves  the level of production from existing wells and realized commodity prices 
to meet our capital and liquidity requirements  we rely on certain resources  including cash flows from operating activities  access to capital markets  and bank borrowings 
while we attempt to operate within forecasted cash flows from operations  we do periodically access our credit facility to finance our working capital needs and growth 
during our total assets increased by million to billion  up from billion at december  our current assets contributed million to the total increase 
the increase in current assets resulted from increases in our cash and cash equivalents  increases in accounts receivable and increases in certain other current assets 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in our oil and gas well equipment and supplies and in deferred income taxes 
in addition  our net oil and gas assets increased during by million and our fixed assets increased by million 
our total liabilities at the end of had increased by million to billion  up from billion at year end year over year current liabilities increased by million  primarily as a result of increases in operations related accounts payable 
long term deferred income taxes increased during by million and long term debt outstanding decreased by million 
at december   stockholders equity totaled billion  up from billion at december  the increase is primarily the result of our net income 
dividends in december  the board of directors declared the company first quarterly cash dividend of 
per share payable to shareholders 
a dividend has been authorized in every quarter since then 
the dividend was increased to per share in december and to per share in february 
table of contents common stock repurchase program in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to four million shares of common stock 
during we repurchased a total of  shares at an average purchase price of 
cumulative purchases through december  total  shares at an average price of 
no purchases were made in or since the quarter ended september  in the board of directors extended the repurchase program to december  working capital analysis our working capital balance fluctuates primarily as a result of our exploration and development activities  our realized commodity prices and our production operating activities 
working capital is also impacted by our current tax provisions  accrued g a and changes in the fair value of our outstanding derivative instruments 
at december   we had positive working capital of million  up million from year end working capital increased primarily because of the following cash and cash equivalents increased by million primarily due to increases in commodity prices and production volumes 
our operations related accounts receivable increased by million 
our prepaid assets increased by million income tax receivable increased by million 
the aggregate fair value of our derivative instruments increased by million 
these working capital increases were partially offset by accrued liabilities related to our drilling activity increased by million 
oil and gas well equipment and supplies decreased by million 
our operations related accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by million 
our deferred tax asset decreased by million 
our receivables are a major component of our working capital and are made up of a diverse group of companies including major energy companies  pipeline companies  local distribution companies and end users in various industries 
the collection of receivables during the period presented has been timely 
historically  losses associated with uncollectible receivables have not been significant 
financing debt at december  and consisted of the following in thousands bank debt notes due floating rate convertible notes due total long term debt bank debt we have a three year senior secured revolving credit facility credit facility 
the credit facility provides for bank commitments of million  with a borrowing base of billion 
the credit facility is 
table of contents provided by a syndicate of banks led by jp morgan chase bank  na  matures on april  and is secured by mortgages on certain of our oil and gas properties and the stock of certain wholly owned operating subsidiaries 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility 
we had letters of credit outstanding of million leaving an unused borrowing availability of million 
during we only had bank borrowings outstanding in the first quarter of the year 
this resulted in average daily bank debt outstanding of million for our maximum amount of bank borrowings outstanding during was million in mid january 
during our average daily bank debt outstanding was million with a maximum amount outstanding of million in mid may 
at the end of our bank debt outstanding was million 
the significant decrease in utilization of our credit facility during is a result of improved realized commodity prices during the year 
at our option  borrowings under the credit facility may bear interest at either a a london interbank offered rate libor plus  based on borrowing base usage  or b the higher of i a prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus  or iii adjusted libor  in each case plus an additional based on borrowing base usage 
the borrowing base under the credit agreement is determined at the discretion of the lenders  based on the collateral value of our proved reserves  and is subject to potential special and regular semi annual redeterminations 
the borrowing base of billion and bank commitments of million were reaffirmed in october the credit facility contains covenants and restrictive provisions which may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  make investments or loans and create liens 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain a current ratio defined to include undrawn borrowings greater than to and a leverage ratio not to exceed to as of december   we were in compliance with all of the financial and non financial covenants 
notes due in may   we issued million of senior unsecured notes that mature may  at par 
interest on the notes is payable may and november of each year 
the notes are governed by an indenture containing covenants that could limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or repurchase our common stock  make investments and other restricted payments  incur liens  enter into sale leaseback transactions  engage in transactions with affiliates  sell assets  and consolidate  merge or transfer assets 
the notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  at any time on and after may  at the following redemption prices expressed as percentages of the principal amount plus accrued interest  if any  thereon to the date of redemption 
percentage and thereafter 
table of contents at any time prior to may   we may redeem all  but not part  of the notes at a price of of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest plus a make whole premium 
if a specified change of control occurs  subject to certain conditions  we must make an offer to purchase the notes at a purchase price of of the principal amount of the notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the purchase 
floating rate convertible notes due on july   all remaining holders of our floating rate convertible notes elected to convert their notes for cash and shares 
in july the holders received million principal of million and million for fractional shares and  shares of common stock 
we recorded a gain of million on the settlement of the notes 
in december  holders of million of the original million issuance amount elected to submit their notes for repurchase 
we repurchased the notes with borrowings under our credit facility 
we recorded a loss of million on the settlement of the notes 
the notes were set to mature on december  the notes were senior unsecured obligations and the interest was at three month libor  reset quarterly 
pursuant to fasb guidance  the debt and equity components of the instruments were accounted for separately 
the value assigned to the debt component was the estimated value of similar debt without a conversion feature as of the issuance date  with the remaining proceeds allocated to the equity component and recorded as additional paid in capital 
the debt component was recorded at a discount and was subsequently accreted to its par value  thereby reflecting an overall market rate of interest in the income statement 
the effective interest rate for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively 
contractual obligations and material commitments at december   we had contractual obligations and material commitments as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years in thousands debt fixed rate interest payments operating leases drilling commitments gas processing facility derivatives asset retirement obligation other liabilities see item a interest rate risk for more information regarding fixed and variable rate debt 
we have drilling commitments of approximately million consisting of obligations to complete drilling wells in progress at december  we also have minimum expenditure commitments of million to secure the use of drilling rigs 
subsequent to year end we entered into a minimum expenditure commitment of million to secure certain dedicated services 
we have a large development project in sublette county  wyoming where we are developing the deep madison gas formation and constructing a gas processing plant 
at december   we had 
table of contents commitments of million relating to construction of the gas processing plant of which million is subject to construction contracts 
the total cost of the project will approximate million 
pursuant to the terms of our operating agreement with our partner in this project  we will be reimbursed by them for of the costs 
the gas processing plant is subject to a delivery commitment agreement over a year period  commencing december  if no deliveries were made  the maximum amount that would be payable under the agreement would be approximately million 
we have excluded the long term asset retirement obligations because we are not able to precisely predict the timing of these amounts 
other liabilities include the fair value of our liabilities associated with our benefit obligations and other miscellaneous commitments 
at december   we had firm sales contracts to deliver approximately bcf of natural gas over the next ten months 
if this gas is not delivered  our financial commitment would be approximately million 
this commitment will fluctuate due to price volatility and actual volumes delivered 
however  we believe no financial commitment will be due based on our reserves and current production levels 
in connection with a gas gathering and processing agreement  we have commitments to deliver a minimum of bcf of gas over the next four years 
certain wells whose production is counted toward that commitment also have individual commitments for gas deliveries 
if no gas was delivered  the maximum amount that would be payable under these commitments would be approximately million  some of which would be reimbursed by working interest owners who are selling with us under our marketing agreements 
we do not expect to make significant payments relative to these commitments 
we have other various delivery commitments in the normal course of business  none of which are individually material 
in aggregate  these commitments have a maximum amount that would be payable  if no gas is delivered  of approximately million  some of which will be reimbursed by working interest owners who are selling with us under our marketing agreements 
all of the noted commitments were routine and were made in the normal course of our business 
based on current commodity prices and anticipated levels of production  we believe that the estimated net cash generated from operations  coupled with the cash on hand and amounts available under our existing bank credit facility will be adequate to meet future liquidity needs  including satisfying our financial obligations and funding our operations and planned exploration  development and other capital expenditures 
outlook we expect our e d capital expenditures to be principally funded from cash flow 
based on current market prices and service costs  we expect that e d expenditures may range from to billion 
at year end we have a large inventory of drilling opportunities and limited lease expirations 
we anticipate approximately of the capital investment to be directed toward the permian basin  to the mid continent and to the gulf coast and other 
our future growth will continue to depend upon our ability to economically add reserves in excess of production 
as has been our historical practice  we regularly review our capital expenditures throughout the year and will adjust our investments based on changes in commodity prices  service cost and drilling success 
operationally we have the flexibility to adjust our capital expenditures based upon market conditions 
though there are a variety of factors that could curtail  delay or even cancel some of our planned operations  we believe our projected program is likely to occur 
the majority of projects are in hand  drilling rigs are being scheduled  and the historical results of our drilling efforts warrant pursuit of the projects 

table of contents production for is projected to be in the range of to mmcfe per day  or a increase over revenues from production will be dependent not only on the level of oil and gas actually produced  but also the prices that will be realized 
during  our realized prices averaged per mcf of gas  per barrel of oil  and per barrel of ngl 
commodity prices can be very volatile and the possibility of realized prices varying from prices in is high 
certain expenses for on a per mcfe basis are currently estimated as follows production expense transportation expense dd a and asset retirement obligation general and administrative production taxes of oil and gas revenue critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
a complete list of our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we have identified certain of these policies as being of particular importance to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following to be our most critical accounting policies and estimates that involve significant judgments and discuss the selection and development of these policies and estimates with our audit committee 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that reserve estimates reported represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
estimations of proved undeveloped reserves can be subject to an even greater possibility of revision 
at year end  of our total proved reserves are categorized as proved undeveloped 
of these proved undeveloped reserves  are related to a project in wyoming and are from the western oklahoma  cana woodford shale play 
our reserve engineers review and revise our reserve estimates regularly as new information becomes available 
additionally  we annually engage an independent petroleum engineering firm to review our proved reserve estimates associated with at least of the discounted future net cash flows before income taxes 
we use the units of production method to amortize our oil and gas properties 
for depletion purposes  reserve quantities are adjusted at interim quarterly periods for the estimated impact of additions  dispositions and price changes 
changes in reserve quantities cause corresponding changes in depletion 
table of contents expense in periods subsequent to the quantity revision 
it is also possible that a full cost ceiling limitation charge could occur in the period of the revision 
the following table presents information regarding reserve revisions largely resulting from items we do not control  such as revisions due to price  and other revisions resulting from better information about production history  well performance and production costs 
net revisions during added bcfe  which included bcfe driven by higher commodity prices 
the rest of the net revisions relate primarily to increases in our ngl volumes 
the determination of whether to record and separately disclose ngl volumes is based on where title transfer occurs during processing of the well stream 
new gas processing contracts and certain contractual amendments resulted in title of ngl volumes transferring to the company 
in addition  increased gas volumes with high btu content have contributed to higher estimated ngl reserves 
years ended december  bcfe change percent of total reserves bcfe change percent of total reserves bcfe change percent of total reserves revisions resulting from price changes other changes in estimates total non price related revisions added bcfe over the three year period over the same period we have seen a bcfe decrease resulting from lower prices 
see note  unaudited supplemental oil and gas disclosures in this report for additional reserve data 
full cost accounting we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
all costs associated with property acquisition  exploration  and development activities are capitalized 
exploration and development costs include dry hole costs  geological and geophysical costs  direct overhead related to exploration and development activities  and other costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves 
salaries and benefits paid to employees directly involved in the exploration and development of properties  as well as other internal costs that can be directly identified with acquisition  exploration  and development activities  are also capitalized 
in addition  gains or losses on the sale or other disposition of oil and gas properties are not recognized in earnings unless the gain or loss would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and natural gas attributable to our full cost pool 
at the end of each quarter  we make a full cost ceiling limitation calculation  whereby net capitalized costs related to proved properties less associated deferred income taxes may not exceed the amount of the present value discounted at of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves less estimated future production and development costs and related income tax expense 
for year end  new sec rules were implemented for future net revenues which require revenue calculations to be based on the unweighted average first day of the month prices for the prior twelve months adjusted for designated cash flow hedges 
in periods prior to we used prices in effect at year end 
changes in proved reserve estimates whether based upon quantity revisions or commodity prices will cause corresponding changes to the full cost ceiling limitation 
if net capitalized costs subject to amortization exceed this limit  the excess would be charged to expense 
any recorded impairment of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date 
due to a significant decrease in period end commodity prices in  our ceiling limitation calculations resulted in excess capitalized costs of billion billion  net of tax  for which we recorded a non cash impairment of oil and gas properties in as a result of further declines in natural 
table of contents gas prices  we recorded an additional non cash impairment of oil and gas properties of million million after tax in the first quarter of our quarterly and annual ceiling test are primarily impacted by commodity prices  reserve quantities added and produced  overall exploration and development costs and depletion expense 
holding all factors constant other than commodity prices  a decline in prices as of december  would not have resulted in a ceiling test impairment 
decreases in commodity prices can also impact our goodwill impairment analyses 
goodwill at december   we had million of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations 
goodwill is subject to annual reviews for impairment based on a two step accounting test 
the first step is to compare the estimated fair value of the company with the recorded net book value including goodwill  after giving effect to any period impairment of oil and gas properties resulting from the ceiling limitation calculation 
if the estimated fair value is higher than the recorded net book value  no impairment is deemed to exist and no further testing is required 
if  however  the estimated fair value is below the recorded net book value  then a second step must be performed to determine the goodwill impairment required  if any 
in this second step  a hypothetical acquisition value of the company is computed utilizing purchase business combination accounting rules 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment review in the fourth quarter of each year 
management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the company for purposes of performing the annual goodwill impairment test 
as of december   the market price per share of our common stock was greater than the book value by per share 
due to volatility in the stock markets  management does not consider the market value of our shares to be an accurate reflection of our net assets for impairment purposes 
to estimate the fair value of the company  we use all available information  including the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved in the assets 
this estimated fair value differs significantly from the valuation used in the ceiling limitation calculation which requires that prices and costs be held constant over the life of the wells and are discounted at 
the ceiling calculation is not intended to be indicative of fair value 
in estimating the fair value of our oil and gas properties for our goodwill impairment analysis  we used projected future prices based on the nymex strip index at december  adjusted for estimated delivery point price differentials 
as of december   the fair value exceeds the carrying value of our net assets 
should lower prices or quantities result in the future  or higher discount rates be necessary  the carrying value of our net assets may exceed the estimated fair value  resulting in an impairment of goodwill 
contingencies a provision for contingencies is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated 
determining when expenses should be recorded for these contingencies and the appropriate amounts for accrual is a complex estimation process that includes subjective judgment 
in many cases  this judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law 
we closely monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingencies and periodically determine when we should record losses for these items based on information available to us 
in january  the tulsa county district court issued a judgment in the hb krug  et al versus helmerich payne  inc h p case 
this lawsuit was originally filed in and addressed h p conduct pertaining to a take or pay settlement  along with potential drainage issues and other related matters 
only million of the judgment pertained to damages  with the remainder being disgorgement of h p estimated potential compounded profit since resulting from the noted damages 
pursuant to the spin off transaction to shareholders of h p by which cimarex became a publicly traded entity  
table of contents cimarex assumed the assets and liabilities of h p exploration and production business 
in we had accrued litigation expense of million for this lawsuit 
during and  we have accrued an additional million and million  respectively 
we have appealed the district court judgments 
in the normal course of business  we have other various litigation related matters 
we assess the probability of estimable amounts related to litigation matters in accordance with guidance established by the fasb and adjust our accruals accordingly 
though some of the related claims may be significant  the resolution of them we believe  individually or in the aggregate  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable state laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset inception  with an offsetting increase to producing properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the income statement 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
for example  as we analyze actual plugging and abandonment information  we may revise our estimates of current costs  the assumed annual inflation of these costs and or the assumed productive lives of our wells 
during  we revised our existing estimated asset retirement obligation by million  or approximately of the asset retirement obligation at december   due to changes in the various related attributes 
over the past three years  revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation averaged approximately 
revisions to the asset retirement obligation are recorded with an offsetting change to producing properties  resulting in prospective changes to depreciation  depletion and amortization expense and accretion of discount 
because of the subjectivity of assumptions and the relatively long lives of most of our wells  the costs to ultimately retire our wells may vary significantly from prior estimates 
recently issued accounting standards there have been no significant accounting standards applicable to cimarex issued during item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
price fluctuations our major market risk is pricing applicable to our oil and gas production 
the prices we receive for our production are based on prevailing market conditions and are influenced by many factors that are beyond our control 
pricing for oil and gas production has been volatile and unpredictable 
we periodically hedge a portion of our price risk associated with our future oil and gas production 

table of contents the following table details the contracts we have in place as of december  natural gas contracts weighted average price fair value period type volume day index floor ceiling swap s jan dec swap  mmbtu pepl  oil contracts weighted average price fair value period type volume day index floor ceiling s jan dec collar  bbls wti  pepl refers to panhandle eastern pipe line company price as quoted in platt inside ferc on the first business day of each month 
wti refers to west texas intermediate price as quoted on the new york mercantile exchange 
while these contracts limit the downside risk of adverse price movements  they may also limit future revenues from favorable price movements 
for the gas contracts listed above  a hypothetical change in the price below or above the contracted price applied to the notional amounts would cause a change in our gain loss on mark to market derivatives in of million 
for the oil contracts listed above  a hypothetical change in the price below or above the contracted price applied to the notional amounts would cause a change in our gain loss on mark to market derivatives in of million 
in spite of the recent turmoil in the financial markets  counterparty credit risk did not have a significant effect on our cash flow calculations and commodity derivative valuations 
this is primarily the result of two factors 
first  we have mitigated our exposure to any single counterparty by contracting with numerous counterparties 
second  our derivative contracts are held with investment grade counterparties that are a part of our credit facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of this report for additional information regarding our derivative instruments 
interest rate risk at december   our debt was our senior unsecured notes that bear interest at a fixed rate of and will mature on may  at december   we consider our interest rate exposure to be minimal because all of our long term debt obligations were at fixed rates 
this assessment excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments
