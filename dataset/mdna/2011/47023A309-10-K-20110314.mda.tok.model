as of december   jamba juice also had nine license agreements in place covering a variety of consumer packaged goods 
the blend plan our strategic priorities the blend plan continues to be the company s strategic plan to transform the jamba brand from a made to order smoothie company to a healthy  active lifestyle brand 
in fiscal  we continued to achieve significant progress against the blend plan strategies and in doing so we continue to evolve and develop the blend plan 
the key strategic priorities for our blend plan in fiscal include continue to build a customer first  operationally focused service culture  continue to expand our beverage and food menu offerings across all four day parts breakfast  lunch  afternoon  and dinner  continue to accelerate the development of franchise and non traditional stores  continue to build a consumer products growth platform  and continue to implement a disciplined expense management plan 
these strategic priorities support the company s mission to continue to grow and develop jamba as a premier healthy  active lifestyle brand  offering consumers compelling and differentiated products and experiences at jamba juice stores and other retail distribution channels 
key to our success is the jamba culture  a unique set of core values and actions that manifest themselves in employees and franchisees executing at the highest levels while expressing their passion for the brand 

table of contents continue to build a customer first  operationally focused service culture a major aspect of our blend plan is to continue to improve the level and consistency of customer service at our stores 
as we move our business model of predominantly company stores to one of predominantly franchise stores  we are devoting significant resources to ensure that all stores offer a superior customer experience 
we believe a great customer experience will help to drive customer loyalty and satisfaction  thus increasing frequency of visits and market share 
in  we implemented a store excellence guide designed to improve operational execution and performance by setting comprehensive standards to achieve and maintain 
we also began the transition from a system wide mystery shop program to a customer survey program to better monitor the customer experience and validate excellence in our customer service standards across the system 
for company store managers  we also recently instituted a new bonus program that rewards customer service goal achievements 
we have also strengthened our customer service program jamba on stage for the entire system 
we believe these changes have both positively impacted customer satisfaction during the year and better positioned the company to ensure that both company stores and franchise stores are delivering the key drivers of customer satisfaction on a consistent basis 
our continued focus on technological and procedural enhancements  in areas such as labor management and scheduling  relieves our store managers from unnecessary administrative reporting and enables them to better focus on delivering exceptional customer service 
we have also leveraged technology to better communicate with our stores and to augment and improve our training programs 
we continued to strengthen our relationships with franchisees to better assist them with rollouts of new products and marketing campaigns  provide best practices  and obtain franchisee feedback 
in anticipation of future growth  we recently embarked on a review of the store environment and customer experience to help ensure we are positioned properly over the coming years to reinforce the vibrant and fun atmosphere customers expect from jamba juice stores  while at the same time delivering improved returns on investment 
we continue to focus on off site sales that involve bringing jamba juice products to sell at an event such as a school  community or sporting events or for delivery to businesses or other organizations for meetings  parties and other special occasions 
our commitment to health and wellness in schools is evidenced in the growth of our school lunch program 
with continued national concern over childhood obesity and nutrition  jamba is well positioned to help schools provide nutritional and healthful beverage and food options to students 
another component of this effort is the enhancement of our fundraising opportunities for non profit organizations 
continue to expand our beverage and food menu offerings across all four day parts breakfast  lunch  afternoon and dinner menu overview we have traditionally provided a range of freshly blended beverages  baked goods and snacks in our stores 
our menu items are designed to strengthen the relationship with our customers by offering products that are relevant to individuals striving to pursue a healthy  active lifestyle 
product innovation is a high priority and our research and development team  composed of food scientists  quality assurance specialists and food industry experts  is continually developing and testing new and improved menu items that support the integrity of the jamba brand and our commitment to offering great tasting products made from high quality ingredients 

table of contents in furtherance of this goal  we continuously seek to improve our products and develop new ones to help mitigate weather and seasonality  create points of differentiation  optimize day parts and operating efficiencies  and encourage habitual behavior 
examples of products we introduced in and early include a number of seasonally relevant  limited time offerings  including new superfruit products utilizing yumberry  or yangmei 
this superfruit is blended into super yumberry classic smoothie  berry yumberry all fruit smoothie and yumberry topper ideal meal

whirl ns frozen yogurt  a line of specialty frozen yogurt treats featuring signature flavors found only at jamba juice 
this line is currently available in select northern california locations  with a regional rollout planned for the summer season 
in  we created the idistrict short for innovation district  a group of company stores used to test major process enhancements  promotions  and product initiatives in a representative cross section of store types and markets 
the idistrict allows us to accelerate our receipt and response of store and customer feedback to new initiatives  allowing us to quickly make adjustments and improve the quality of products and processes we deliver to the system 
we plan to grow our beverage and food capability further during fiscal in particular  we plan to expand our breakfast offerings in with menu items that complement our existing breakfast menu and utilize the turbo chef ovens already employed across the system 
we also plan to launch our first ever fruit and vegetables smoothie platform 
we strive to utilize organic ingredients in our menu offerings and other products when they meet our quality  cost  and supply assurance standards 
our menu currently includes six organic hot teas  hot oatmeal made with organic steel cut oats  and healthy blended breakfast smoothies topped with organic granola 
in addition  we offer a range of organic  high quality  packaged  good for you snacks 
we also utilize organic sanitizers in many of our stores 
the items in our grab and go food portfolio  which are continually being refined and optimized  are supplied to us by a single supplier using regional co packers and are distributed to our system stores by multiple distributors 
we continue to believe there is consumer demand for better for you on the go food items that is not being fulfilled by other quick service restaurants 
our menu options continue to meet our four mandatory core standards grams of trans fat  no high fructose corn syrup  no artificial preservatives  and no artificial flavors 
our goal is for jamba juice to be the leader in the specialty better for you beverage retailer segment 
product innovation our research and development team continually seeks to enhance the product offerings available to customers  and where possible  reduce product and labor costs 
our research and development process includes 
table of contents both the development of new products and the optimization of existing menu items to ensure only the most appealing products are offered to customers 
we are passionate about creating differentiated  healthy  active lifestyle products that meet an even greater breadth and depth of customer needs 
while there is no certainty that product development efforts will lead to the introduction and success of new product offerings or a potential increase in operating margins  we will continue to use these resources to try to develop unique concepts that appeal to customers at any time of day and in any weather or season 
continue to accelerate the development of franchise and non traditional stores jamba juice stores a primary goal of the company is to grow our brand by establishing more points of distribution to make it easier for customers to experience all that jamba has to offer 
we believe we have significant market expansion opportunities both nationally and internationally 
our market planning has shown that there is potential for at least  total jamba juice traditional and non traditional stores in the united states  all of which we believe can be profitable and would meet our new store opening criteria 
we have grown our concept and brand through company store and franchise store locations 
as of december   there were jamba juice locations consisting of company stores and franchise stores operating in states and the bahamas 
of the locations  stores are located in california  of which are company stores and are franchise stores 
we lease the real estate for all of our company stores 
we generally characterize our stores as either traditional or non traditional locations 
traditional locations are characterized as a business premise that exists primarily as a jamba juice store 
traditional stores average approximately  square feet in size 
these stores are located either in major urban centers or in suburban strip mall centers 
as of december   there were traditional jamba juice store locations 
non traditional locations are characterized as a jamba juice store located within another primary business in conjunction with other businesses or at institutional settings such as colleges and universities  shopping malls  supermarkets and airports 
a captive audience is a common characteristic of non traditional locations 
we believe one benefit of the development of non traditional stores is to increase awareness of the jamba juice brand to complement the traditional stores in the area 
as of december   there were non traditional jamba juice store locations 
we continue to innovate in the design of traditional and non traditional stores as well 
our goal is to vary the size and format of our stores to allow us to locate them in or near a variety of settings 
as a result  the typical costs to construct a jamba juice non traditional stores ranges from  to  and the typical costs to construct a traditional jamba juice store ranges from  to  we believe a variety of formats will provide a greater degree of customer access and convenience to our stores that will help attract franchisees and help provide them a higher return on investment on their capital expenditures 
express platform to further expand our brand  in we launched an innovative new express platform utilizing compact technology to make select smoothie flavors in stations using pre packaged ingredients 
the express platform targets venues with high volume and needing high speed service where a full sized jamba juice store or kiosk would not be feasible 
such venues include schools  grocery stores  stadiums  theaters  and select airport locations 
included in the franchise store count in were five express platform franchise locations 
the company generates revenue from the express platform through a markup on the smoothie ingredients and through franchise fees 

table of contents international franchising our brand and products have international appeal  and we have attracted interest from business partners overseas 
in  we launched our first international store in the bahamas 
in we signed an agreement with spc group to develop jamba juice stores in south korea 
spc group currently operates over  stores and is actively developing franchises and its bakery business through affiliates such as paris croissant  br korea baskin robbins  dunkin donuts  shany  and samlip general foods 
our first jamba juice store opened in south korea at incheon international airport in january  and we expect spc group to open up to stores in south korea over the next decade 
we work closely with spc group to develop and implement the jamba juice system  recognizing commercial  cultural and dietary diversity 
we continue to engage in discussions with additional potential partners regarding the expansion of jamba juice stores into various international markets 
the success of further international expansion will depend on  among other things  local acceptance of the jamba juice concept and menu offerings and our ability to attract qualified franchisees 
our agreements take the form of development and franchise agreements under which we typically receive an initial territory fee  store opening fees  and ongoing royalty revenues based on a percentage of sales 
franchising growth strategy the focus of our growth strategy is to continue to expand the development of traditional and non traditional franchise stores and the express platform franchise locations 
we believe this franchise strategy will better position us for growth in market share  reduce capital outlays  provide better overall margins  allow us to open more stores at a faster pace  increase our brand presence to support other company initiatives such as consumer products licensing program  and increase customer frequency 
in  through the sale of company stores to franchisees and the development of new franchise stores  we increased franchise ownership within the jamba juice system from approximately to approximately 
with the anticipated completion of our refranchising program  and predominately new growth through franchise store development  we expect the percentage of franchise stores at the end of to be approximately 
for fiscal  franchisees opened thirty new franchise stores  closed four franchise stores two through natural lease expiration and two through early termination  and acquired company stores which are now operated as franchise stores in refranchising transactions 
we continuously monitor franchise store operations  principally through our regional franchise leaders 
company representatives make both scheduled and unannounced inspections of franchise stores to ensure that only approved products are in use and that our prescribed operations practices and procedures are being followed 
we have the right to terminate a franchise agreement if a franchisee does not operate and maintain a franchise store in accordance with our requirements 
we also monitor the financial health of our franchisees through business and financial reviews 
we maintain a franchise advisory council fac 
the fac formalizes a channel of communication through a representative group of franchisees to provide advice  counsel and input to us on important issues impacting the business 

table of contents franchising our franchising program through our franchising program  we offer franchisees choices in store format and number of stores they wish to operate including i traditional store venues such as single store franchises  ii nontraditional store venues such as mall  university  supermarket or airport locations  iii express platform locations  and iv exclusive multi unit license agreements in which the franchisee develops and operates a specified number of stores within a specified period of time within a specified geographic area  which we call area development agreements as described in franchising area development agreements below 
our current traditional store franchise agreement provides for an initial year term 
the agreement is renewable for two consecutive year terms  subject to various conditions and state law 
the royalty rate in the current franchise agreement for domestic locations is generally of revenue  with franchisees required to contribute up to an additional of revenue to a company administered advertising fund 
at the present time  in general  we are charging of revenue as the marketing contribution for our traditional store franchisees 
traditional store franchisees are also expected to spend of sales on local marketing efforts 
there is typically up to a one mile geographic radius restriction for traditional stores in non downtown areas 
the royalty rates and marketing contributions for non traditional stores vary depending upon type airport  college or university or supermarket 
franchisees typically pay an initial fee of up to  for traditional store locations and an initial fee ranging from zero  for non traditional store locations 
we generally do not provide any form of financing to our franchisees 
express platform franchise locations pay an initial fee of  have an initial term of years  with successive one year renewals  and instead of royalties pay a mark up on ingredient purchases 
franchising area development agreements as of december   we had eleven area developers who have the right to develop additional franchise stores pursuant to development agreements 
the exclusive territories covered by these agreements include selected markets in the states of colorado  florida  hawaii  indiana  louisiana  massachusetts  nevada  new jersey  oregon  utah and washington 
as of december   ten of the eleven developers had contractual commitments to open an aggregate of new franchise stores in their respective territories over the next several years 
seven of the eleven development agreements were entered into in connection with refranchising transactions see below where a purchaser of company stores also agrees to develop new franchise stores 
area developers typically enter into a separate franchise agreement for each store opened 
under typical development agreements  the area developer generally pays one half of a  initial fee  or  for each store required to be developed upon execution of the multi unit development agreement as a development fee 
area developers are obligated to finance their own build out of each store location according to our specifications 
we also continue to strengthen our relationships with beverage and food concessionaires operating at non traditional venues such as universities  airports  and other retail and entertainment venues to help maximize our non traditional franchise development 
franchising our refranchising initiative in may we announced our refranchising initiative under which we stated our intent to sell existing company stores to new or existing franchisees who want to operate multiple store locations 
our refranchising 
table of contents initiative has helped us to accelerate growth  achieve certain operational efficiencies  and position franchisees and aspiring area developers with local or regional expertise to succeed by providing a core of established stores within their exclusive development area 
under the refranchising initiative  we initially planned to complete the refranchising of up to company stores to new or existing franchisees 
during fiscal  we completed the sale of company stores in fifteen separate refranchising transactions  bringing the refranchising program total to company stores sold 
we expect to conclude our refranchising program with the sale of company stores in the chicago and minneapolis markets in early in many refranchising transactions  we entered into development agreements committing buyers to build additional franchise stores in the regions their purchased stores occupy 
in addition  as part of these refranchising transactions  buyers of mature company stores are obligated to refresh and refurbish these stores 
franchising market planning and site selection process our market planning and site selection process is integral to the successful execution of our growth strategy 
we have processes for identifying  analyzing  and assigning undeveloped markets for either company store or franchise store development 
once a market is selected  we carefully screen trade areas for demand based on demographic  psychographic and jamba juice specific variables to assess the risk of developing a store or permitting a franchisee to do so 
we review trade areas to ensure that they meet our guidelines for new store development and begin the site selection or approval process 
once a trade area is approved  we carefully screen prospective locations for visibility  traffic patterns  ease of use and co tenancy for potential company store and franchise store locations 
our expansion strategy involves using this market planning and site selection process to leverage areas of demand within each market 
we intend to use this approach to encourage the clustering of stores in specific geographic areas of demand  which we believe will drive brand awareness  improve operating and marketing efficiencies for franchise stores while leveraging the costs associated with regional supervision 
distribution efficiencies can also be realized through this strategy 
in addition  we believe the ability to hire qualified team members is enhanced in markets where jamba is a broadly recognized brand 
in addition to our own efforts  we are approached by sophisticated concessionaires and contract feeders whose independent research has identified us as ideal for locations such as universities  sport venues  airports  and other non traditional venues where they have exclusive rights from venue owners to develop 
when it fits our expansion strategies  these opportunities are incorporated into our own plans 
continue to build a consumer products growth platform extending the jamba brand into the retail consumer packaged goods market continues to provide significant business opportunities 
at the close of  the company had nine license agreements in place 
these nine agreements include one with nestl usa to introduce a line of all natural  fruit based energy drinks 
this line of products was launched in february in the northeastern united states 
in addition to energy beverages  the company also signed agreements with one natural experience one to develop a line of fruit infused coconut water beverages 
this new line of jamba branded coconut water beverages will be brought to market via the one distribution system  which includes distribution through the pepsi beverage company 
the company also signed agreements with zola for a line of functional daily brazilian super fruit shots  with johnvince foods for all naturally boosted trail mixes  and with sundia corporation for functionally boosted fruit cups 
we continue to have discussions with potential licensees regarding new and complimentary product categories that we believe are a good fit with the jamba brand 
our goal is to extend our product offerings outside of our jamba juice stores to not only generate revenue  but also to expand the brand accessibility and product usage occasions available to consumers 
all of our agreements to date have been structured as license agreements  whereby we receive ongoing royalties based on a percentage of product sales 
in the future  to support and optimize our brand extension  we may structure these relationships in other ways such as joint venture agreements  co packing agreements  and sales and distribution agreements 

table of contents in  we entered into a non binding memorandum of intent with core mark holdings company  inc to establish a relationship to offer and deliver health oriented jamba branded beverage and food consumer products  including those produced by jamba licensees  to core mark serviced convenience retail locations 
this relationship represents one way we can assist our licensees in commercializing the licensed jamba branded products at retail 
continue to implement a disciplined expense management plan this strategic priority affects all aspects of our system in our efforts to continue to improve store level profitability and returns for company store and franchise stores 
strong store level economics is critical to the company s success and therefore management is diligently focused on initiatives to improve these metrics 
we also monitor our general and administrative expenses so that we may better leverage our existing infrastructure in support of our growth strategy 
store operations company store management we believe operational excellence at both the company store level and the franchise store level is vital to the company s success 
our company store field and store operations team plays a critical role in maximizing the performance of our stores across the system 
we recruit and retain leaders with broad experience in management and our industry 
we support our company store operations with a combination of area directors of operations and district managers 
our typical company store operations team consists of a combination of a general manager at each store  two to four shift managers and approximately to front line team members depending on the time of year 
we continually evaluate opportunities to optimize our labor planning algorithms further to achieve optimal staffing levels throughout the day  which may help us reduce staffing costs at certain stores under certain circumstances 
maintaining our culture in company stores as well as franchise stores is essential as we continue to expand  and we believe that it is critical to developing our brand and ensuring our continued success 
we believe team members are the key to our success and support the development of a culture that fosters personal interaction  mutual respect  trust  empowerment  enthusiasm and commitment 
training we conduct various training programs for franchisees  team members  support center staff and our leadership team 
we are dedicated to providing a meaningful experience for all employees  with ample opportunity to develop leadership skills as they move up through the organization 
our training programs include formal programs such as the manager in training programs for new managers and informal one on one discussions held between general managers  district managers and area directors of operations 
all of our training programs reinforce the importance of strong customer service and sales skills 
we also make training materials and best practice information available to our franchisees to help create  preserve  and support a singular culture of excellence within all of the stores that comprise our system 
recruiting and retention we carefully screen potential employees to ensure that they hold many of our core values and fit into our culture 
by maintaining this emphasis and encouraging responsibility and accountability at every level  we believe that we have created a sense of team member loyalty and an open and interactive work environment  resulting in a highly passionate workforce 
our employees are paid competitive wages and are offered opportunities for advancement 
in addition to competitive wages  store managers are eligible for performance 
table of contents based bonuses 
we also provide best practice information  qualifications and other information to our franchisees to assist them with hiring and retention and to preserve a singular culture within the stores that comprise our system 
advertising and marketing our marketing strategy focuses on promoting jamba juice as a healthy  active lifestyle brand for consumers who prefer not to sacrifice taste or quality 
marketing efforts are primarily concentrated on creating local buzz that will generate positive word of mouth  an approach we call owning the trade area around our stores 
we also use social media outlets to encourage greater frequency of visits from existing customers and to drive trial and awareness among potential new customers 
currently we have over  fans who like us on facebook and over  followers on twitter 
consistent with the origins of our brand  we also engage local non profits and community organizations to drive brand awareness  trial and usage frequency among their members 
we also look to our jamba branded consumer products licensees to generate brand awareness through their advertising and promotion efforts 
in general  each traditional store  whether a company store or franchise store  presently contributes of sales to a national marketing fund and is also expected to spend an additional of sales on local marketing efforts 
in addition  the company plans to develop regional advertising initiatives to assist certain regions spend a portion of their local marketing spending obligations 
we engage in marketing campaigns to enhance national brand awareness 
we use print  radio  email  online and other advertising media in furtherance of this goal 
we also benefit from national media attention relating to some of our programs 
historically  we have not engaged in any mass media marketing programs  nevertheless  we have been featured in stories appearing in nationally syndicated papers  including the wall street journal and a host of local newspapers and magazines 
we have also received product placement in television shows and feature films 
our participation in local fundraising events also helps capture a significant amount of coverage from local television stations 
product supply we are committed to providing only the finest smoothies  juices and other food products 
smoothie and juice products depend heavily upon supplies of fresh and individually quick frozen iqf fruit 
the quality of each smoothie depends to a large degree on the quality of the basic fruit ingredients from which it is made 
it is therefore essential that the supply of fruit is of the highest quality and is consistent throughout the year 
to achieve these goals we purchase our projected requirements for the coming year of a given type of fruit from suppliers at the height of the season for that particular fruit 
the supply and price of fresh and iqf fruit are dependent upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and are subject to significant volatility 
supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing regions  including weather  natural disasters and regional political and economic conditions 
in addition  as we continue to grow  we will likely become more dependent upon global fruit supplies than we have in the past  which could allow natural disasters and global political and economic conditions to have a greater effect on the supply and price of our fruit ingredients and our profitability 
southwest traders  inc is a distributor of proprietary products to our company stores and franchise stores 
southwest traders distributed ingredients that made up approximately of cost of goods for jamba juice company during fiscal southwest traders does not manufacture or negotiate pricing agreements for products sold in our stores 
they serve solely in a warehousing and distribution capacity 
in  the company initiated a program whereby the company s purchasing organization for company stores and franchise stores would be funded by all company stores and franchise stores instead of solely out of the company s general and administrative expenses 
this change became necessary as we started to move from a predominately company store model to a franchise store model in order to achieve the funding levels required 
table of contents to procure  manage  and support suppliers with respect to products  equipment  and distribution services to support the system 
the funding for this program is achieved from a mark up of certain products purchased by company stores and franchise stores  which is subsequently rebated back to the company by the supplier 
we believe this program allows the company to provide the best supply chain services to achieve the highest quality of products at the lowest prices and in compliance with the company s quality and safety standards 
we also believe this program better aligns the interests of the company stores and the franchise stores from a cost of goods perspective 
competition the retail beverage and food industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
restaurants compete based on a number of factors  including quality  price value relationships  customer service  name recognition  employee hiring and retention and location 
we compete with a variety of purveyors of quick  convenient beverage and food products  including quick service restaurants fast food establishments  coffee shops  donut shops and grocery stores 
while competition in the beverage and food market is fragmented  competition is increasing  and a major competitor with substantially greater resources than the company could enter the market at any time and compete directly against jamba juice stores 
we compete most directly with regional smoothie stores  most of which are franchises of other smoothie brands 
the rising popularity of convenient and healthy food items may result in increased competition from non smoothie retailers as they increase their offerings of smoothies and other juice related products  and as we increase our food offerings we will be placing ourselves into direct competition with other quick serve food concepts with well established businesses 
in  we believe competition from mcdonald s nationwide introduction and promotion of its new smoothie line negatively impacted company store sales in the third quarter when they were introduced 
however  in the subsequent quarter we regained our number one market share smoothie category leader and we believe in the longer term that the mcdonald s launch will be beneficial by expanding consumer awareness of the smoothie category 
in addition  we also face intense competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for suitable sites for new stores and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 
there can be no assurance that the company or our franchisees will be able to continue to secure adequate sites at acceptable rent levels or that the company or franchisees will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel to operate our stores 
government regulation and environmental matters government regulation 
we are subject to extensive and varied federal  state and local government regulation  including regulations relating to public health and safety and zoning codes 
we operate each of our stores in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations 
however  if we could not obtain or retain food or other licenses  it would adversely affect our operations 
although we have not experienced  and do not anticipate  any significant difficulties  delays or failures in obtaining required licenses  permits or approvals  any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of  or adversely impact the viability of  a particular store or group of stores 
california and other states and local jurisdictions have enacted laws  rules  regulations and ordinances which may apply to the operation of a company store  including those which a establish general standards  specifications and requirements for the construction  design and maintenance of the store premises  b regulate matters affecting the health  safety and welfare of our customers  such as general health and sanitation requirements for restaurants  employee practices concerning the storage  handling  cooking and preparation of food  special health  food service and licensing requirements  restrictions on smoking  exposure to tobacco smoke or other carcinogens or reproductive toxicants and saccharin  availability of and requirements for public 
table of contents accommodations  including restrooms  c set standards pertaining to employee health and safety and mandatory health insurance  d set standards and requirements for fire safety and general emergency preparedness  e regulate the proper use  storage and disposal of waste  insecticides and other hazardous materials  f establish general requirements or restrictions on advertising containing false or misleading claims  or health and nutrient claims on menus or otherwise  such as low calorie  fat free or organic  g establish requirements concerning withholdings and employee reporting of taxes on tips and h regulate or ban the use of polystyrene cups 
in order to develop and construct more stores  we or our franchisees need to comply with applicable zoning  land use and environmental regulations 
federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations to date  but expansion of our menu offerings or more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or even prevent construction and increase development costs for new stores 
we and our franchisees are also required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the us americans with disabilities act  which generally prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability 
we may  in the future  have to modify stores  for example  by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures  to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons 
while these expenses could be material  our current expectation is that any such action will not require us to expend substantial funds 
we are subject to the us fair labor standards act  the us immigration reform and control act of and various federal and state laws governing various matters including minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions 
we pay a significant number of our hourly staff at rates consistent with but higher than the applicable federal or state minimum wage 
accordingly  increases in the minimum wage would increase our labor cost 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to our current and any future franchise operations 
see risk factors governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 
we are also subject to various federal and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and aspects of the licensor licensee relationships 
many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreement  including the duration and scope of non competition provisions  the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply 
the federal trade commission  or the ftc  and some state laws also require that the franchisor furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document that contains prescribed information and  in some instances  require the franchisor to register the franchise offering 
environmental matters 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the use of polystyrene products  and several counties in which our stores are located have already banned the use of our polystyrene cups 
as more state and local governments take actions to preserve the environment we may be subject to further bans on the use of polystyrene cups 
a federal ban on the use of polystyrene cups would force us to eliminate the use of polystyrene products system wide 
we are actively exploring economically viable alternatives to polystyrene cups  which can provide the same quality and integrity of our frozen smoothies to ensure customer satisfaction 
during  we continued to make progress on new eco sustainability initiatives first launched in we focused on waste reduction  increasing the use of recyclable products and utilizing more organic ingredients 
our green initiatives include the introduction of more environmentally friendly packaging for our products  the launch of several optimization programs to reduce waste  participation in recycling programs  and participation in composting programs for of our food waste where it is feasible for us to do so 
among the packaging improvements made to date are the introduction of new cup carriers  oatmeal cups and lids  breakfast clear cups and lids  spoons and napkins that are made from recycled material 
we have also reduced the amount of corrugated cardboard used for bulk shipping  reduced labeling requirements  and reduced freight  resulting in lower fuel emissions 

table of contents trademarks and domain names the company owns and or has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the united states and in other jurisdictions covering more than additional countries throughout the world 
some of the company s trademarks  including jamba juice and the jamba logo are of material importance to the company 
the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country 
however  trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and or their registrations are properly maintained 
in addition  the company has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names  including jamba 
com and jambajuice 
com 
management information systems each company store has computerized point of sale registers which collect transaction data used to generate pertinent information  including sales transactions and product mix 
additionally  the point of sale system is used to authorize  batch and transmit credit card data 
all product prices are programmed into the point of sale register from the company s corporate office 
franchise stores generally use the same point of sale registers as company stores  but may elect to use alternative systems provided certain information is provided to the company 
franchisees set their own menu prices 
company stores use the company s licensed labor scheduling software to record employee time clock information  schedule labor  and provide management reports 
company stores and many franchise stores use the company s licensed food cost management software to improve inventory management and provide management reports 
we believe the current point of sale register system is adequate to support our expansion needs 
in  the company plans to deploy supply chain management software tools to improve product forecasting by better balancing the disparity between supply and demand through improved business processes and using algorithms and consumption analysis to better plan future needs 
these tools will include integration technology that will allow the company to communicate information electronically with supply chain partners 
seasonality our business is highly subject to day to day volatility based on weather and varies by season 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is realized during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year  which include the summer months 
the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  which encompasses the winter months and the holiday season  has traditionally been our lowest revenue volume quarter 
although we have expanded the number of stores offering our hot oatmeal  grab and go food  and california flatbreads  have also launched our hot blends beverage platform  and will soon launch a hot  savory breakfast platform to help offset the seasonal nature of our business  our business will likely continue to be subject to seasonal patterns for the foreseeable future  given that the largest portion of our sales continues to be from the sale of smoothies during the warmer parts of the year 
because of the seasonality of the business  results for an individual quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results which may be achieved for the full fiscal year

item a 
risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
risks related to our business we may not be successful in implementing our strategic priorities  which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
in fiscal we continued to implement the strategic priorities under our blend plan that we believed necessary to revitalize the company for future growth and long term stockholder value  including continuing to build a customer first operationally focused service culture  continuing to expand our beverage and food menu offerings across all four day parts breakfast  lunch  afternoon and dinner  continuing to accelerate the development of franchise and non traditional stores  continuing to build a consumer products growth platform  and continuing to implement a disciplined expense reduction plan 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to successfully implement these strategic priorities or whether these strategic priorities will be successful  and a failure of either could impede our growth and operating results 

table of contents we have a history of net losses and may incur losses in the future 
we have incurred net losses in each of the last four fiscal years 
we may continue to incur net losses in the future and we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain profitability 
a worsening of economic conditions or a decrease in consumer spending may substantially decrease our revenues and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending  which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income 
while there are signs that conditions may be improving  there is no certainty that this trend will continue or that credit and financial markets and confidence in economic conditions will not deteriorate again 
accordingly  we may experience continuing declines in revenue during economic turmoil or during periods of uncertainty 
any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending  leading cost conscious consumers to be more selective in restaurants visited  could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  results of operations  business and financial condition 
the challenges of competing with the many food services businesses may result in reductions in our revenue and operating margins 
we compete with many well established companies  food service and otherwise  on the basis of taste  quality and price of product offered  customer service  atmosphere  location and overall guest experience 
our success depends  in part  upon the popularity of our products and our ability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all four day parts 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our products  our inability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all day parts  or changes in our menu that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business 
we compete with other smoothie and juice bar retailers  specialty coffee retailers  yogurt and ice cream shops  bagel shops  fast food restaurants  delicatessens  caf s  take out food service companies  supermarkets and convenience stores 
our competitors change with each of the four day parts  ranging from coffee bars and bakery caf s to casual dining chains 
many of our competitors or potential competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do  which may allow them to react to changes in the market quicker than we can 
in addition  aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets  as evidenced by mcdonald s corporation s inclusion of fruit smoothies on their menu  could reduce our revenue and operating margins 
we also compete with other employers in our markets for hourly workers and may become subject to higher labor costs as a result of such competition 
we are subject to risks associated with climate change and climate change regulation 
laws and regulations regarding climate change  energy usage and emissions controls may impact the company directly through higher cost of goods 
the potential impacts of climate change and climate change regulations are highly uncertain at this time  and the company cannot anticipate or predict the material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows as a result of climate change and climate change regulations 
our revenue is subject to volatility based on weather and varies by season 
seasonal factors cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
because the majority of our revenue results from the sale or smoothies  our revenue is typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people choose cold beverages and higher during the spring  summer and fall months for the opposite reason 
fluctuations in various food and supply costs  particularly fruit and dairy  could adversely affect our operating results 
supplies and prices of the various products that we use to prepare our offerings can be affected by a variety of factors  such as weather  seasonal fluctuations  demand  politics and economics in the producing countries 

table of contents these factors subject us to shortages or interruptions in product supplies  which could adversely affect our revenue and profits 
in addition  the prices of fruit and dairy  which are the main products in our offerings  can be highly volatile 
the fruit of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis  depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase 
an increase in pricing of any fruit that we use in our products could have a significant adverse effect on our profitability 
in addition  higher diesel and gasoline prices may affect our supply or transportation costs and may affect our revenue going forward 
although we attempt to help mitigate the risks of volatile commodity prices and allow greater predictability in pricing by entering into fixed price or to be fixed priced purchase commitments for a portion of our fruit and dairy requirements  we cannot assure you that these activities will be successful or that they will not result in our paying substantially more for our fruit supply than would have been required absent such activities 
declines in sales may also adversely affect our business to the extent we have long term purchase commitments in excess of our needs 
we are primarily dependent upon one supplier for a significant amount of our food distribution 
we maintain food distribution contracts primarily with one supplier 
this supplier  southwest traders  inc  provided approximately of our cost of goods for fiscal  and and of cost of goods for each of our fiscal years and  respectively  which potentially subjects us to a concentration of business risk 
if this supplier had operational problems  our operations could be adversely affected 
we may face difficulties entering into new or modified arrangements with existing or new suppliers or new service providers 
if we expand our operations into new geographic areas through new company stores or franchise stores or introduce new products with special manufacture  storage or distribution requirements  we may have to seek new suppliers and service providers or enter into new arrangements with existing ones 
we may also encounter difficulties or be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms as favorable as those we currently enjoy  which could harm our business and operating results 
for example  the company has faced challenges related to the high distribution costs for stores located outside of california in delivering our grab and go portfolio comprised of fresh  perishable products 
the company s success depends on the value of the jamba juice and jamba brands 
the jamba juice brand practice is to inspire and simplify healthy living 
we believe we must preserve and grow the value of the jamba juice brand in order to be successful in building our business and particularly in building a consumer products growth platform primarily under the jamba brand 
brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions  and the jamba juice brand has been highly rated in several recent brand studies 
we intend to reinforce and extend these perceptions for the jamba brand to help support our licensing efforts 
our brand building initiatives involve increasing our product offerings  opening new franchise stores and entering into licensing arrangements to increase awareness of our brands and create and maintain brand loyalty 
our licensees are often authorized to use our logos and provide branded beverages  food and other products directly to customers 
we provide training and support to  and monitor the operations of  these business partners  but the product quality and service they deliver may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control  including financial pressures 
we believe customers expect the same quality of products and service from our licensees as they do from us 
any shortcoming of one of our business partners  particularly an issue affecting the quality of the service experience or the safety of beverages or food  may be attributed by customers to us  thus damaging our reputation and brand value and potentially affecting our results of operations 
if our brand building initiatives are unsuccessful  or if business incidents occur which erode consumer perceptions of our brand  then the value of our products may diminish and we may not be able to implement our business strategy 
we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property  which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business 
our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business 
our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to build further brand recognition using our trademarks  service 
table of contents marks  trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property  including our name and logos and the unique ambiance of our stores both domestically and overseas 
we have secured the ownership and rights to our marks in the united states and have filed or obtained registrations for restaurant services in most other significant foreign jurisdictions 
we undertake similar efforts to protect our brands in other relevant consumer product categories in relevant jurisdictions 
if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate  or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property  the value of our store brand and our consumer products brands may be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we have not encountered claims from prior users of intellectual property relating to restaurant services in areas where we operate or intend to conduct material operations in the near future  there can be no assurances that we will not encounter such claims 
if so  this could harm our image  brands or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 
our business could be adversely affected by increased labor or healthcare costs 
self insurance plan claims could materially impact our results 
labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business 
we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our team members 
a considerable number of the team members employed by us are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage 
in  the federal minimum wage increased from to and it increased again in to 
additionally  many of our company store team members work in stores located in states where the minimum wage is greater than the federal minimum and receive compensation equal to the state s minimum wage 
the current california minimum wage is 
any further increases in the federal minimum wage or the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases where our employees may be located will increase labor costs 
additionally  competition for employees in various markets could result in higher required wage rates 
furthermore  the company is self insured for team member healthcare and dental benefits 
the company pays a substantial part of the healthcare benefits for team members at the general manager level and above and for those working at the company s corporate office 
liabilities associated with the risks that the company retains are estimated in part  by considering historical claims experience  demographic factors  severity factors  and other actuarial assumptions 
the estimated accruals for these liabilities are based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as the company s actual historical trends 
if actual claims experience differs from the company s assumptions  historical trends  and estimates  changes in the company s insurance reserves could materially impact our results of operations 
the recently enacted patient protection and affordable care act as well as other healthcare reform legislation being considered by congress and state legislatures may have an impact on our business 
while we are currently evaluating the potential effects of the patient protection and affordable care act on our business  the impact could be extensive and will most likely increase our employee healthcare related costs 
while the significant costs of the recent healthcare legislation enacted will occur after due to provisions of the legislation being phased in over time  changes to our healthcare costs structure could have a significant  negative impact on our business 
we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to long term non cancelable leases 
we and our franchisees compete for real estate and our or their inability to secure appropriate real estate or lease terms could impact our respective abilities to grow 
our leases generally have initial terms of between five and years  and generally can be extended only in five year increments if at all 
we generally cannot cancel these leases 
if an existing or new store is not profitable  and we decide to close it  as we have done in the past and may do in the future  we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including  among other things  paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term 
additionally  because we sublease the premises of company stores sold to franchisees in our refranchising program  we are still legally liable to the landlords under the prime leases  and we will need to assume obligations under the prime lease should a franchisee default on its sublease obligations 
current locations of our stores and franchised locations may become unattractive as demographic patterns change 
in addition  as each of our leases expire  we may fail to negotiate renewals  either on commercially acceptable terms or at all  which could require us to close stores in desirable locations 

table of contents our business and results may be subject to disruption from work stoppages  terrorism or natural disasters 
our operations may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including work stoppages  acts of war  terrorism  pandemics  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters 
in particular  our corporate offices and support center is located in northern california  near known earthquake fault lines 
if a major earthquake or other natural disaster were to occur in northern california  our corporate offices and support center may be damaged or destroyed 
such a disruption could result in the temporary or permanent loss of critical data  suspension of operations  delays in shipments of product  and disruption of business in both the affected region and nationwide  which would adversely affect our revenue and results of operations 
the unexpected loss of one or more members of our executive management team could adversely affect our business 
our success depends substantially on the contributions and abilities of our executive management team and other key employees 
we believe that these individuals understand our operational strategies and priorities and the steps necessary to drive our long term growth and stockholder value 
competition for personnel in our industry is strong and the ability to retain key employees during a revitalization effort can be difficult 
while we have entered into employment agreements with each of our executive officers  we cannot make any assurances that we can retain these individuals for the period necessary for us to achieve and sustain profitability 
our failure to continue to recruit  retain  and motivate executive management and other key employees sufficient to maintain a competitive position within our industry and to implement our strategic priorities would adversely affect our results of operations 
we are highly dependent on the financial performance of stores concentrated in certain geographic areas 
our financial performance is highly dependent on stores located in california 
stores located in california comprise over of our total system stores and generate a significant portion of our company store revenues 
in recent years california and other states have experienced significant economic impact due to the current economic climate 
if geographic regions in which we have a high concentration of stores continue to experience significant economic pressures  our sales and operating results could be negatively impacted 
in addition  state and local laws  government regulations  weather conditions and natural disasters affecting california and other regions where we have a high concentration of stores may have a material impact upon our results 
governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 
we and our franchisees are subject to various federal  state and local regulations 
each of our stores is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health  sanitation  food and workplace safety and other agencies 
we and our franchisees may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new stores  which could delay planned store openings 
in addition  stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new stores in particular locations 
our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act  which governs such matters as minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions  along with the us americans with disabilities act  family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters 
in recent years  there has been an increased legislative  regulatory and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry 
establishments operating in the quick service and fast casual segments have been a particular focus  and compliance with additional regulations can become costly and affect our operating results 

table of contents our federal  state and local tax returns may  from time to time  be selected for audit by the taxing authorities  which may result in tax assessments  interest or penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we are subject to federal  state and local taxes in the us in making tax estimates and paying taxes  significant judgment is often required 
although we believe our tax positions and estimates are reasonable  if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the company  we could have an additional tax liability  including interest and penalties 
if material  payment of such additional amounts could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
our ability to use our tax attributes may be limited due to an ownership change 
based on information available to us  we believe that we underwent an ownership change as defined in section of the internal revenue code during the second quarter of our fiscal year  as a result of our issuance of series b convertible preferred stock and series b convertible preferred stock and other prior trading in our stock 
the amount of our taxable income for tax years ending after our ownership change which may be offset by net operating loss carryovers from pre change years will be subject to an annual limitation  known as a section limitation 
the section limitation is generally based on the value of our stock immediately before the ownership change multiplied by the long term tax exempt rate in effect at the time of the ownership change  subject to increase if we had net unrealized built in gains and if such net unrealized built in gains are recognized  or are deemed recognized under irs guidance  during the year period beginning on the ownership change date 
if we had net unrealized built in losses  and if the net unrealized built in losses are recognized during the year period beginning on the ownership change date  such losses will generally be treated as if incurred prior to the ownership change  for purposes of applying the annual limitation 
any section limitation amount not used in a taxable year to offset taxable income can be carried forward to the next post change taxable year 
net operating losses may generally be carried forward to each of the taxable years following the taxable year of the loss 
with respect to tax credits  there is a limitation under section of the internal revenue code whereby the post change year credit usage is limited to the credit equivalent of any section limitation amount remaining after carrying forward pre change losses 
we have not yet ascertained the approximate amount of our section limitation  whether we have net unrealized built in gains or net unrealized built in losses  the effect on the section limitation of any potential future recognition of net unrealized built in gains or any net unrealized built in losses during the year period beginning on the ownership change  and whether any net operating losses are likely to expire unused due to the taxable year net operating loss carry forward period 
the effect of future realization of net unrealized built in gains or net unrealized built in losses  if any  is subject to various factors including  among other things  when  and at what price  we dispose of the related assets 
the section limitation may be reduced if there is another section ownership change  resulting in a lower section limitation  during a time when we continue to be a loss corporation 
if we are profitable in the future  and if the foregoing limitations on loss and credit usage affect our ability to offset taxable income and taxes with losses and credits  we could be adversely affected due to increased tax liability 
if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  then a valuation allowance is recognized with respect to our deferred tax assets 
after consideration of all the evidence  both positive and negative  management has previously concluded even prior to the determination that there was an ownership change resulting in a section limitation that it is not more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to depreciation  tax goodwill  jambacards  accrued expenses and net operating losses will be realized and a full valuation allowance has been maintained against our net deferred tax assets 

table of contents risks related to our franchise business our growth strategy depends on increasing franchise ownership 
because our current growth strategy is to transition from a company store model to one of growth fueled by franchise store development  we receive an increasingly significant amount of our revenues in the form of royalties from our franchisees 
resultantly  the success of our business is increasingly dependent upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees 
this strategy is subject to risks and uncertainties 
while our franchise agreements set forth certain operational standards and guidelines  we have limited control over how our franchisees businesses are run  and any significant inability of our franchisees to operate successfully could adversely affect our operating results through decreased royalty payments 
we may not be able to identify franchisee candidates with appropriate experience and financial resources or to negotiate mutually acceptable agreements with those that do 
our franchisee candidates may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open or continue operating the stores contemplated by their franchise agreements with us 
in addition  franchisees may not be able to find suitable sites on which to develop new stores or negotiate acceptable lease terms for the sites  obtain the necessary permits and government approvals or meet construction schedules 
if our franchisees incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt  it could result in financial distress or even possible insolvency or bankruptcy 
if a significant number of our franchisees become financially distressed  this could harm our operating results through reduced or delayed royalty payments or increased rent obligations for leased properties on which we are contingently liable 
expansion into new geographic markets may present increased risks 
franchise growth is planned in new geographic areas in the united states and select international market for fiscal our future results  and the results of new franchise stores  depend on various factors  including successful selection and expansion into these new geographic markets and market acceptance of the jamba juice experience 
those markets may have different competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns as compared to existing markets 
as a result  those new stores may be less successful than stores in our existing markets 
consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the jamba juice brand  and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned 
franchisees may find it more difficult in new markets to hire  motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision  passion and culture 
stores opened in new markets may also have lower average store revenue than stores opened in existing markets  and may have higher construction  occupancy or operating costs than stores in existing markets 
furthermore  we may have difficulty in finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us  either initially or over time  with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards 
revenue at stores opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected revenue levels  and may never do so  thereby affecting our overall royalty income 
as with the experience of other retail food concepts that have tried to expand nationally and internationally  we may find that the jamba juice concept has limited or no appeal to customers in new markets or we may experience a decline in the popularity of the jamba juice experience 
newly opened stores may not succeed  future markets and stores may not be successful and  even if we are successful  our average store revenue  and the royalty income generated therefrom  may not increase and may even decline 
our efforts to expand internationally may not be successful and could impair the value of our brand 
our current strategy includes international expansion in a number of countries around the world 
expanding into international markets will expose us to new risks and uncertainties  including product supply  import export limitations and regulations to which we are not currently bound and may not be currently set up to handle  consumer preferences  occupancy costs  operating expenses and labor and infrastructure challenges 
if stores open in international markets and such stores are unable to source inventory locally  franchisees may be required to import inventory from our us distributors and any resulting import duties  tariffs  transportation or other charges may disproportionately impact such stores cost of goods which could harm the viability of such stores 

table of contents finally  international operations have inherent risks such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the application and effect of local laws and regulations and enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights 
additionally  effectively managing growth can be challenging  particularly as we continue to expand into new international markets where we must balance the need for flexibility and a degree of autonomy for local management against the need for consistency with our goals  philosophy and standards 
failure of our international expansion strategy could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
termination or non renewal of franchise agreements may disrupt store performance 
each franchise agreement is subject to termination by us in the event of default by the franchisee after the applicable cure periods 
upon the expiration of the initial term of a franchise agreement  the franchisee generally has an option to renew for an additional term 
there is no assurance that franchisees will meet the criteria for renewal or will desire or be able to renew their franchise agreements 
if not renewed  a franchise agreement and payments required thereunder will terminate 
we may be unable to find a new franchisee to replace such lost revenue 
furthermore  while we will be entitled to terminate franchise agreements following a default that is not cured within the applicable cure period  if any  the disruption to the performance of the stores could materially and adversely affect our business 
our franchising strategy means we will become more dependent on franchisees for our success 
several of our franchisees have been experiencing financial pressures  which  in certain instances  became more exacerbated during fiscal our franchisees closed four stores in fiscal through natural lease expiration and through early termination  and franchisees may close additional stores in the future 
royalty revenues are directly correlated to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  franchise store closures have an adverse effect on our revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding involving a franchisee could prevent us from collecting payments or exercising any of our other rights under the related franchise agreement 
our refranchising strategy may not realize intended benefits  the failure of royalty revenue to replace revenue available from company store sales or the failure of area developers to succeed in their obligations 
as of december   we have refranchised company stores as a result of our refranchising efforts  resulting in a shift to a greater percentage of franchise stores 
the conversion of a company store to a franchise store reduces the total monthly revenue received by us from that store because we receive all of the revenue generated by a company store but receive only royalty payments generated by a franchise store 
while we expect the conversion of a company store to a franchise store to reduce or eliminate the unreimbursed operating costs we incur in connection with the operation of such store  the future benefit realized from refranchising the store is uncertain and may be less than anticipated  and may not be sufficient to offset the loss of revenue from the conversion of the company store 
the success of each transaction and the refranchising program as a whole will depend upon  among other things  our buyers ultimate ability to effectively operate the stores they purchased  our ability to limit our exposure to contingent liabilities in connection with the sale of our stores and whether the resulting ownership mix of company stores and franchise stores will allow us to meet our financial objectives 
our existing management  infrastructure  financial  and other resources may be inadequate to support our franchise growth strategy 
in addition  although some buyers in our refranchising transactions have entered into area development agreements to develop and open additional stores  there is no guarantee that the franchisees will succeed in their efforts to open additional stores 
our franchisees could take actions that harm our reputation and reduce our royalty revenue 
franchisees are independent contractors and are not our employees 
further  we do not exercise control over the day to day operations of our franchise stores 
any operational or development shortcomings of our franchise stores  
table of contents including their failure to comply with applicable laws  are likely to be attributed to our system wide operations in the eyes of consumers and could adversely affect our reputation and have a direct negative impact on the royalty revenue we receive from those stores 
we could face liability from our franchisees and from government agencies 
a franchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisor franchisee relationship 
various state and federal laws govern our relationship with our franchisees and our potential sale of a franchise 
if we fail to comply with these laws  we could be liable for damages to franchisees  fines or other penalties 
expensive litigation with our franchisees or government agencies may adversely affect both our profits and our important relations with our franchisees 
risks related to the food service business litigation and publicity concerning food quality  health and other issues can result in liabilities  increased expenses  distraction of management and can also cause customers to avoid our products  which could adversely affect our results of operations  business and financial condition 
food service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government authorities resulting from food quality  allergens  illness  injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one retail location or a limited number of retail locations 
adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us  regardless of whether the allegations are true  by discouraging customers from buying our products 
our customers occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our stores  or that we have problems with food quality or operations 
we are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business  including personal injury claims  contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters  discrimination and similar matters  and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future 
regardless of whether any claims against us are valid  or whether we are ultimately held liable  claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance 
a judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage  or for which we are not covered by insurance  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects  which in turn could adversely affect our results 
in addition  the food services industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products they sell  and disclosure and advertising practices 
we may also be subject to this type of proceeding in the future and  even if not  publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fast casual segments of the industry may harm our reputation or prospects and adversely affect our results 
food safety concerns and instances of food borne illnesses could harm our customers  result in negative publicity and cause the temporary closure of some stores and  in some cases  could adversely affect the price and availability of fruits and vegetables  any of which could harm our brand reputation  result in a decline in revenue or an increase in costs 
we consider food safety a top priority and dedicate substantial resources toward ensuring that our customers enjoy high quality  safe and wholesome products 
however  we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food borne illnesses 
furthermore  our reliance on third party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food borne illness incidents such as e 
coli  hepatitis a  salmonella or listeria could occur outside of our control and at multiple locations 
instances of food borne illnesses  whether real or perceived  and whether at our stores or those of our competitors  could harm customers and otherwise result in negative publicity about us or the products we serve  which could adversely affect 
table of contents revenue 
if there is an incident involving our stores serving contaminated products  our customers may be harmed  our revenue may decrease and our brand name may be impaired 
if our customers become ill from food borne illnesses  we could be forced to temporarily close some stores 
in addition  we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of making any such changes and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors 
food safety concerns and instances of food borne illnesses and injuries caused by food contamination have in the past  and could in the future  adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause customers to shift their preferences  particularly if we choose to pass any higher ingredient costs along to consumers 
as a result  our costs may increase and our revenue may decline 
a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity  or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our stores  could materially harm our business 
bans on the use of polystyrene products can negatively impact our operating results 
we are subject to regulations regarding the use of polystyrene products  and several counties in which our stores are located have already banned the use of our polystyrene cups 
as more state and local governments take similar actions  we may be subject to further bans on the use of polystyrene cups 
a national ban on the use of polystyrene cups would force us to eliminate the use of polystyrene which could potentially increase our costs and create customer satisfaction issues that could ultimately affect our operating results 
risks related to ownership of common stock failure of the company s internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
internal control over financial reporting includes i maintaining reasonably detailed records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions  and ii providing reasonable assurance that we a record transactions as necessary to prepare the financial statements  b make receipts and expenditures in accordance with management authorizations  and c would timely prevent or detect any unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud 
any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 
a significant financial reporting failure could cause an immediate loss of investor confidence in us and a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 
our anti takeover provisions may delay or prevent a change of control of us  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change of control of us  which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
for example  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan  commonly known as a poison pill  which would make it difficult for someone to acquire the company without the approval of the board of directors 
also  the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include other anti takeover provisions such as limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend its charter documents  including stockholder supermajority voting requirements  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call a special meeting absent the request of the holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock  and advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals

upon a liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the affairs of the company  whether voluntary or involuntary  the holders of shares of the series b preferred are entitled to receive a liquidation payment prior to the payment of any amount with respect to shares of our common stock 
because of the substantial liquidation preference to which the holders of shares of the series b preferred are entitled  the amount available to be distributed to the holders of shares of our common stock upon a liquidation of the company could be substantially limited or reduced to zero and may make it more difficult to raise capital or recruit and retain key personnel in the future 
the securities purchase agreement for the sale of shares of the series b preferred the securities purchase agreement and the certificate of designation governing the series b preferred the series b certificate of designation contain various covenants and restrictions which may limit our ability to operate our business 
under the securities purchase agreement and the series b certificate of designation  we are not permitted  without the affirmative vote or written consent of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of series b preferred and the series b preferred  voting together as a single class  directly or indirectly  to take or agree to take certain actions involving a broad array of corporate activities 
these restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs or could otherwise restrict corporate activities  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business

the series b preferred is redeemable at the option of the holders under certain circumstances 
on or after june   the holders of at least a majority of the then outstanding shares of series b preferred may require us to redeem all or any portion of the outstanding shares of series b preferred 
the redemption price per share of the series b preferred is to be calculated in accordance with the certificate of designation 
depending on our cash resources at the time that this redemption right is exercised  we may or may not be able to fund the redemption from our available cash resources 
if we were unable to fund the redemption from available cash resources we would need to find an alternative source of financing to do so 
there can be no assurances that we would be able to raise such funds on favorable terms or at all if they are required 
we have agreed to give the holders of shares of the series b preferred the right to participate in subsequent stock issuances 
we agreed that if we issue and sell any new equity securities after june   subject to certain exceptions  we will give the series b purchasers the right to purchase a portion of those new securities so as to permit each of them to maintain their proportional ownership in our stock as long as such purchaser beneficially owns at least of the shares such purchaser originally purchased on june  the existence of this right may make it more difficult for us to obtain financing from third parties that do not wish to have series b purchasers participating in their financing 
the series b preferred private placement could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
each share of series b preferred stock is convertible into that number of shares of common stock equal to the quotient determined by dividing as adjusted for any stock dividends  combinations  splits  recapitalizations and the like with respect to such shares by the then applicable conversion price currently per share

the holder of a share of series b preferred may elect to convert that holder s share at any time 
in addition  after june   we have the right to force conversion of the then outstanding shares of series b preferred upon certain conditions being met 
sales in the public market of the shares of common stock acquired upon conversion of shares of the series b preferred or the exercise of an outstanding warrant for series b preferred  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise funds in additional stock financings
