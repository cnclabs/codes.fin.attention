item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  that are not historical facts  are forward looking statements 
in some cases these statements are identifiable through the use of words such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  plan  project  target  can  could  may  should  will  would  and similar expressions 
the forward looking statements we make are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to various assumptions  risks  and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by these forward looking statements 
these factors include  among others  those set forth below and in the other documents that we file with the sec 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise  except as required by law 
following is a discussion of some of the more significant risks that could materially impact our business 
our strategic plan includes further acquisitions 
our strategic plan includes further acquisitions  and the extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and integrated can affect our overall growth  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
our business strategy involves continued acquisitions to support our growth  product portfolio  and business plans 
our ability to successfully acquire businesses may decline if we are unable to appropriately identify acquisition targets consistent with our strategic plan  the competition among potential buyers increases  or the cost of acquiring suitable businesses becomes too expensive 
as a result  we may be unable to make acquisitions or be forced to pay more or agree to less advantageous acquisition terms for the companies that we are able to acquire 
our ability to implement our business strategy and grow our business  particularly through acquisitions  may depend on our ability to raise capital by selling equity or debt securities or obtaining additional debt financing 
market conditions may prevent us from obtaining financing when we need it or on terms acceptable to us 
we may have difficulty integrating the operations of acquired businesses  which could negatively affect our results of operations and profitability 
we may have difficulty integrating acquired businesses and future acquisitions might not meet our performance expectations 
some of the integration challenges we might face include differences in corporate culture and management styles  additional or conflicting governmental regulations  preparation of the acquired operations for compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  financial reporting that is not in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles  disparate company policies and practices  customer relationship issues  and retention of key personnel 
in addition  management may be required to devote a considerable amount of time to the integration process  which could decrease the amount of time we have to manage the other businesses 
some of the businesses we acquired or are interested in acquiring involve more complex technology and shorter product life cycles than are typical for belden  and we might not be able to properly evaluate and develop the technology 
we may not be able to successfully or cost effectively integrate operations  which could have a negative effect on our results of operations or our profitability 
the process of integrating operations could also cause some interruption of  or the loss of momentum in  the activities of acquired businesses 

table of contents the global cable  connectivity  and networking industries are highly competitive 
we compete with other manufacturers of cable  connectivity  and networking products  and also face potential competition  in north america  europe  and asia 
these companies compete on price  reputation and quality  product technology and characteristics  and terms 
some multinational competitors have greater engineering  financial  manufacturing  and marketing resources than we have 
actions that may be taken by competitors  including pricing  business alliances  new product introductions  market penetration  and other actions  could have a negative effect on our revenue and profitability 
moreover  during economic downturns  some competitors that are highly leveraged both financially and operationally could become more aggressive in their pricing of products 
if we are unable to retain senior management and key employees  our business operations could be adversely affected 
our success has been largely dependent on the skills  experience  and efforts of our senior management and key employees 
the loss of any of our senior management or other key employees  including due to acquisitions or restructuring activities  could have an adverse effect on us 
we may not be able to find qualified replacements for these individuals and the integration of potential replacements may be disruptive to our business 
more broadly  a key determinant of our success is our ability to attract  develop and retain talented associates 
while this is one of our strategic priorities  we may not be able to succeed in this regard 
a challenging global economic environment or a downturn in the markets we serve could adversely affect our operating results and stock price in a material manner 
a challenging global economic environment could cause substantial reductions in our revenue and results of operations as a result of weaker demand by the end users of our products and  for some products  price erosion 
such price erosion may occur through competitors becoming more aggressive in their pricing practices  which could adversely impact our gross margins 
these global economic conditions could also make it difficult for our customers  our vendors  and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities 
our customers could also face issues gaining timely access to sufficient credit  which could have an adverse effect on our results if such events cause delays in collection or write offs of receivables 
further  the demand for many of our products is economically sensitive and will vary with general economic activity  trends in nonresidential construction  investment in manufacturing facilities and automation  demand for information technology equipment  and other economic factors 
we may be unable to successfully implement our strategic plan 
our strategic plan is designed to improve revenues and profitability  reduce costs  and improve working capital management 
to achieve these goals  our strategic priorities are to continue deployment of our market delivery system mds so as to capture market share through end user engagement  channel management  outbound marketing  and vertical strategy  improve our recruitment and development of talented associates  develop strong global connector and fiber platforms  acquire businesses that fit our strategic plan  and become a leading lean company 
lean refers to a business management system that strives to create value for customers and deliver that value to the right place  at the right time  and in the right quantities while reducing or eliminating waste from all processes 
we have a disciplined process for deploying this strategic plan through our associates 
there is a risk that we may not be successful in executing these measures to achieve the expected results for a variety of reasons  including market developments  economic conditions  shortcomings in establishing appropriate action plans  or challenges with executing multiple initiatives simultaneously 
for example  our mds initiative may not succeed or we may lose market share due to challenges in choosing the right products to market or the right customers for these products  integrating products of acquired companies into our sales and marketing strategy  or strategically bidding against oem partners 
we may not be able to acquire businesses that fit our strategic plan on acceptable business terms  and we may not achieve our other strategic priorities 

table of contents because we do business in many countries  our results of operations are affected by changes in currency exchange rates and are subject to political  economic  and other uncertainties 
more than half of our sales are outside the united states 
other than the us dollar  the principal currencies to which we are exposed through our manufacturing operations and sales are the euro  the canadian dollar  the hong kong dollar  the chinese yuan  the mexican peso  the australian dollar  and the british pound 
in most cases  we have revenues and costs in the same currency  thereby reducing our overall currency risk  although the realignment of our manufacturing capacity among our global facilities may alter this balance 
when the us dollar strengthens against other currencies  the results of our non us operations are translated at a lower exchange rate and thus into lower reported earnings 
we have manufacturing facilities in canada  china  mexico  and several european countries 
we rely on suppliers in many countries  including china 
our foreign operations are subject to economic and political risks inherent in maintaining operations abroad such as economic and political destabilization  land use risks  international conflicts  restrictive actions by foreign governments  and adverse foreign tax laws 
a risk associated with our european manufacturing operations is the higher relative expense and length of time required to adjust manufacturing employment capacity 
our performance will also be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in these markets and geographies  including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force  expansion of market opportunities in emerging markets such as china and india  migration away from a fragmented  sub scale  high cost manufacturing footprint  and potential volatility in raw material costs 
we may experience significant variability in our quarterly and annual effective tax rate which would affect our reported net income 
we have a complex tax profile due to the global nature of our operations  which encompass multiple taxing jurisdictions 
variability in the mix and profitability of domestic and international activities  identification and resolution of various tax uncertainties  changes in tax laws and rates  and the extent to which we are able to realize net operating loss and other carryforwards included in deferred tax assets  among other matters  may significantly affect our effective income tax rate in the future 
our effective income tax rate is the result of the income tax rates in the various countries in which we do business 
our mix of income and losses in these jurisdictions affects our effective tax rate 
relatively more income in higher tax rate jurisdictions or relatively more losses in lower tax rate jurisdictions would increase our effective tax rate and thus lower our net income 
if we generate losses in tax jurisdictions for which no benefits are available  our effective income tax rate will increase 
a significant increase in our effective income tax rate could have a material adverse impact on our earnings 
we rely on several key distributors in marketing our products 
the majority of our sales are through distributors 
these distributors carry the products of competitors along with our products 
our largest distributor customer  anixter international inc  accounted for of our revenue in if we were to lose a key distributor  our revenue and profits would likely be reduced  at least temporarily 
in the past  we have seen some distributors acquired and consolidated 
if there were further consolidation of the electronics and cable distributors  this could affect our relationships with these distributors 
it could also result in consolidation of distributor inventory  which would temporarily depress our revenue 
we have also experienced financial failure of distributors from time to time  resulting in our inability to collect accounts receivable in full 
the current global economic downturn raises the potential of our customers incurring financial difficulties including bankruptcy  which would adversely affect our results of operation as a result of lower customer sales and write offs of uncollectible accounts receivable 
changes in the price and availability of raw materials we use could be detrimental to our profitability 
copper is a significant component of the cost of most of our products 
over the past few years  the prices of metals  particularly copper  have been highly volatile 
copper rose rapidly in price for much of this period and remains a volatile commodity 
prices of other materials we use  such as polyvinylchloride pvc and other plastics 
table of contents derived from petrochemical feedstocks  have also been volatile 
generally  we have recovered much of the higher cost of raw materials through higher pricing of our finished products 
the majority of our products are sold through distribution  and we manage the pricing of these products through published price lists which we update from time to time  with new prices typically taking effect a few weeks after they are announced 
some oem contracts have provisions for passing through raw material cost changes  generally with a lag of a few weeks to three months 
if we are unable to raise prices sufficiently to recover our material costs  our earnings will be reduced 
if we raise our prices but competitors raise their prices less  we may lose sales  and our earnings will be reduced 
if the price of copper were to decline  we may be compelled to reduce prices to remain competitive  which could have a negative effect on revenue  and we may be required  according to the terms of contracts with certain of our distributors  to reimburse them for a portion of the price they paid for our products in their inventory 
we believe the supply of raw materials copper  plastics  and other materials is adequate and we do not expect any substantial interruption of supply or shortage of materials 
if such a supply interruption or shortage were to occur  however  this could have a negative effect on revenue and earnings 
legal compliance issues could adversely affect our business 
we have a strong legal compliance and ethics program  including a code of business conduct and ethics  policies on anti bribery  export controls and other legal compliance areas  and periodic training to relevant associates on these matters 
while we believe that this program should reduce the likelihood of a legal compliance violation  such a violation could still occur  disrupting our business through fines  penalties  diversion of internal resources  and negative publicity 
our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
our markets are characterized by the introduction of products with increasing technological capabilities  including fiber optic and wireless signal transmission solutions that compete with the copper cable solutions that comprise the majority of our revenue 
the relative costs and merits of copper cable solutions  fiber optic cable solutions  and wireless solutions could change in the future as various competing technologies address the market opportunities 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to enhance existing products and to develop and manufacture new products that meet or anticipate such changes  which will require continued investment in engineering  research and development  marketing  and customer service and support 
we have long been successful in introducing successive generations of more capable products  but if we were to fail to keep pace with technology or with the products of competitors  we might lose market share and harm our reputation and position as a technology leader in our markets 
competing technologies could cause the obsolescence of many of our products 
see the discussion above in part i  item  under importance of new products and product improvements  impact of technological change  impact of acquisitions volatility of credit markets could adversely affect our business 
uncertainty in us and global financial and equity markets could make it more expensive for us to conduct our operations and may cause us to be unable to pursue or complete acquisitions 
if our goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired  we may be required to recognize charges that would reduce our income 
under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not amortized but must be reviewed for possible impairment annually or more often in certain circumstances if events indicate that the asset values are not recoverable 
we have incurred significant charges for the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in the past  and we may be required to do so again in future periods if the underlying value of our business declines 
such a charge would reduce our income without any change to our underlying cash flow 

table of contents we might have difficulty protecting our intellectual property from use by competitors  or competitors might accuse us of violating their intellectual property rights 
disagreements about patents and intellectual property rights occur in our served markets 
third parties have asserted and may in the future assert claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us or against our customers or channel partners for which we may be liable 
furthermore  a successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or prevents us from distributing certain products or performing certain services 
potential problems with our information systems could interfere with our business and operations 
we rely on our information systems and those of third parties for processing customer orders  shipping of products  billing our customers  tracking inventory  supporting accounting functions and financial statement preparation  paying our employees  and otherwise running our business 
any disruption in our information systems or those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business 
in addition  we may need to enhance our information systems to provide additional capabilities and functionality 
the implementation of new information systems and enhancements is frequently disruptive to the underlying business of an enterprise 
any disruptions affecting our ability to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis could adversely affect our business in a number of respects 
if we are unable to successfully implement information systems enhancements  our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be negatively impacted 
some of our employees are members of collective bargaining groups  and we might be subject to labor actions that would interrupt our business 
some of our employees  primarily outside the united states  are members of collective bargaining units 
we believe that our relations with employees are generally good 
however  if there were a dispute with one of these bargaining units  the affected operations could be interrupted resulting in lost revenues  lost profit contribution  and customer dissatisfaction 
we are subject to current environmental and other laws and regulations  including the risks associated with possible climate change legislation 
we are subject to the environmental laws and regulations in each jurisdiction where we do business 
we are currently and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and clean up costs of certain sites damaged by the discharge of hazardous substances  including sites that have never been owned or operated by us but at which we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws 
changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions and changes in enforcement policies thereunder could adversely affect our operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for noncompliance 
greenhouse gas emissions have increasingly become the subject of a large amount of attention 
legislation related to climate change have been introduced in the us congress 
in addition  future regulation of greenhouse gas could occur pursuant to future us treaty obligations or statutory or regulatory changes under existing environmental laws 
while not all are likely to become law  additional climate change regulation may adversely affect our costs by increasing energy costs and raw material prices and requiring equipment modification or replacement 
this list of risk factors is not exhaustive 
other considerations besides those mentioned above might cause our actual results to differ from expectations expressed in any forward looking statement

item legal proceedings we are a party to various legal proceedings and administrative actions that are incidental to our operations 
these proceedings include personal injury cases  of which are pending as of february   in which we are one of many defendants 
electricians have filed a majority of these cases  primarily in pennsylvania and illinois  generally seeking compensatory  special  and punitive damages 
typically in these cases  the claimant alleges injury from alleged exposure to a heat resistant asbestos fiber 
our alleged predecessors had a small number of products that contained the fiber  but ceased production of such products more than years ago 
through february   we have been dismissed  or reached agreement to be dismissed  in more than similar cases without any going to 
table of contents trial  and with only a small number of these involving any payment to the claimant 
in our opinion  the proceedings and actions in which we are involved should not  individually or in the aggregate  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  operating results  or cash flows

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  manufacture  and market a portfolio of cable  connectivity  and networking products in markets including industrial  enterprise  broadcast  and consumer electronics 
we strive to create shareholder value by capturing additional market share by improving channel and end user relationships  and concentrating sales efforts on customers in specific vertical markets  investing in both organic and inorganic growth in fast growing regions  continuously improving business processes throughout the enterprise via a comprehensive lean tool set and the institution of a continuous improvement mind set across the company  migrating our manufacturing capacity to low cost locations within each major geographic region to be closer to our customers and to reduce the landed cost of our products  managing our product portfolio to position products according to value  eliminate low margin revenue  and increase revenue in higher margin and strategically important products  recruiting and developing the best talent we can find and improving the effectiveness of our performance management processes  and protecting and enhancing the value of the belden brand and our family of brands 
to accomplish these goals  we use a set of tools and processes that are designed to continuously improve business performance in the critical areas of quality  delivery  cost  and innovation 
we consider revenue growth  operating margin  cash flows  return on invested capital  and working capital management metrics to be our key operating performance indicators 
we also seek to acquire businesses that we believe can help us achieve the objectives described above 
the extent to which appropriate acquisitions are made and integrated can affect our overall growth  operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
we generated approximately of our sales outside of the united states in as a global business  our operations are affected by worldwide  regional  and industry economic and political factors 
our market and geographic diversity limits the impact of any one market or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results 
our individual businesses monitor key competitors and customers  including to the extent possible their sales  to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future 
in addition  we use indices concerning general economic trends to predict our outlook for the future given the broad range of products manufactured and end markets served 
we generated year over year revenue increases in each quarter during as many of our served markets began to recover from the broad based declines in demand experienced in the second half of and in as a result  consolidated revenues for increased over we continue to operate in a highly competitive business environment in our served markets and geographies 
our performance will be affected by our ability to address a variety of challenges and opportunities in these markets and geographies  including trends toward increased utilization of the global labor force  expansion of market opportunities in emerging markets such as brazil  china  and india  migration away from a fragmented  sub scale  high cost manufacturing footprint  and potential volatility in raw material costs 
although we use the united states dollar as our reporting currency  a substantial portion of our assets  liabilities  operating results  and cash flows reside in or are derived from countries other than the united states 
these assets  liabilities  operating results  and cash flows are translated from local currencies into the united states dollar using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
we have generally accepted the exposure to currency exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the united states dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  operating results  and cash flows in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents significant trends and events in the following trends and events during have had varying effects on our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
disposition we sold trapeze networks  inc trapeze during the fourth quarter for million in cash 
the trapeze operations comprised the entirety of our former wireless segment 
acquisitions we completed two acquisitions during the fourth quarter 
we acquired the communications products business of thomas betts communications business for cash of million on november  the communications business provides drop and hard line connectors  hardware and grounding products  and telecom enclosures and connectors for the broadband catv markets 
this acquisition improves our position as an end to end solution provider in the broadcast end markets  including broadband catv  security and surveillance  and professional broadcasting 
we acquired garrettcom  inc garrettcom for cash of million on december  garrettcom provides advanced industrial networking products and smart grid solutions  including industrial grade switches  routers  converters  serial communications  and security software to the power utility  surveillance  transportation  specialty industrial automation  and telecommunications markets 
the acquisition complements our existing portfolio of industrial networking solutions and will enable us to provide a more diverse set of end market applications 
the results of operations of both the communications business and garrettcom have been included in our results of operations from their respective acquisition dates and are reported within the americas segment 
commodity prices our operating results can be affected by changes in prices of commodities  primarily copper and compounds  which are components in some of the products we sell 
generally  as the costs of inventory purchases increase due to higher commodity prices  we raise selling prices to customers to cover the increase in costs  resulting in higher sales revenue but a lower gross profit percentage 
conversely  a decrease in commodity prices would result in lower sales revenue but a higher gross profit percentage 
selling prices of our products are affected by many factors  including end market demand  capacity utilization  overall economic conditions  and commodity prices 
importantly  however  there is no exact measure of the effect of changing copper prices  as there are thousands of transactions in any given quarter  each of which has various factors involved in the individual pricing decisions 
therefore  all references to the effect of copper prices are estimates 
global restructuring activities during  we completed the restructuring activities originally initiated in the fourth quarter to streamline our manufacturing  sales  and administrative functions 
we recognized severance costs primarily in the americas segment totaling million related to these restructuring activities and the closure of one of our two manufacturing plants in leominster  massachusetts 
we do not expect to recognize any additional severance costs related to these restructuring activities 
share based compensation we provide certain employees and non employee directors with share based compensation in the form of stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock units with service vesting conditions  and restricted stock units with performance vesting conditions 
at december   the total unrecognized compensation cost related to all nonvested awards was million 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years

the results of operations for trapeze have also been included in discontinued operations 
during  we completed the sale of our discontinued communications cable operation in phoenix  arizona 
in connection with this sale and related tax deductions  we established a reserve for uncertain tax positions

liquidity and capital resources significant factors affecting our cash liquidity include cash provided by operating activities  disposals of tangible assets  exercises of stock options  cash used for acquisitions  restructuring actions  capital expenditures  share repurchases  and dividends  and our available credit facilities and other borrowing arrangements 
we expect our operating activities to generate cash in and believe our sources of liquidity are sufficient to fund current working capital requirements  capital expenditures  contributions to our retirement plans  quarterly dividend payments  and our short term operating strategies 
economic conditions worldwide  customer demand  competitive market forces  customer acceptance of our product mix  and commodities pricing could affect our ability to continue to fund our future needs from business operations

the change in operating assets and liabilities was million as the change in operating assets and liabilities for was a use of cash of million compared to a source of cash of million for an increase in accounts receivable and inventories represented the largest change in operating assets and liabilities 
accounts receivable were a use of cash for the period due to the increase in revenues year over year and an increase in our days sales outstanding from days at the end of to days at the end of we calculate days sales outstanding by dividing accounts receivable as of the end of the quarter by the average daily revenues recognized during the quarter 
inventories were a use of cash for the period as well due to the increase in inventory necessary to support our higher revenues and a decrease in our inventory turns from turns at the end of to 
table of contents turns at the end of we calculate inventory turns by dividing annualized cost of sales for the quarter by the inventory balance at the end of the quarter 
these increases in accounts receivable and inventories were partially offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net cash used for investing activities decreased by million in from this decrease was due to an increase in the proceeds from the disposal of tangible assets and a decrease in capital expenditures partially offset by an increase in the cash used to acquire businesses 
the million increase in over in the proceeds from the disposal of tangible assets results from the million received in from our sale of trapeze 
the million decrease in capital expenditures in compared to primarily resulted from a reduced level of spending on our enterprise resource planning software 
we anticipate that future capital expenditures will be funded with available cash 
the increase in cash used to acquire businesses resulted from the use of cash in to acquire garrettcom and the communications products business of thomas betts compared to the use of cash in to acquire telecast 
net cash used for financing activities increased by million in over this change is primarily due to the repayment of million of outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility during this change was partially offset by the receipt of million of cash upon the termination of our derivative instruments in  a million difference in the proceeds received upon the exercise of stock options in over  and the payment of million of non recurring debt issuance costs during our outstanding debt obligations as of december   consisted of million aggregate principal of senior subordinated notes due and million aggregate principal of senior subordinated notes due as of december   there were no outstanding borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  and we had million in available borrowing capacity

current year adoption of recent accounting pronouncements discussion regarding our adoption of accounting pronouncements is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience or various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and the results form the basis for making judgments about the reported values of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
we provide a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following circumstances are satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred 
delivery occurs in the period in which the customer takes title and assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the products specified in the customer s purchase order or sales agreement 
accounts receivable at the time of sale  we establish an estimated reserve for trade  promotion  and other special price reductions such as contract pricing  discounts to meet competitor pricing  and on time payment discounts 
we also adjust receivables balances for  among other things  correction of billing errors  incorrect shipments  and settlement of customer disputes 
customers are allowed to return inventory if and when certain conditions regarding the physical state of the inventory and our approval of the return are met 
certain distribution customers are allowed to return inventory at original cost  in an amount not to exceed three percent of the prior year s purchases  in exchange for an order of equal or greater value 
until we can process these reductions  corrections  and returns together  the adjustments through individual customer records  we estimate the amount of outstanding adjustments and recognize them by reducing revenues and accounts receivable 
we also adjust inventory and cost of sales for the estimated level of returns 
we base these estimates on historical and anticipated sales demand  trends in product pricing  and historical and anticipated adjustments patterns 
we make revisions to these estimates in the period in 
table of contents which the facts that give rise to each revision become known 
future market conditions and product transitions might require us to take actions to further reduce prices and increase customer return authorizations 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on the specific identification method 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the realization of accounts receivable  including the current creditworthiness of each customer and related aging of the past due balances 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition 
through these evaluations  we may become aware of a situation where a customer may not be able to meet its financial obligations due to deterioration of its financial viability  credit ratings  or bankruptcy 
in circumstances where we are aware of a customer s inability or unwillingness to pay outstanding amounts  we record a specific reserve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the receivable to its estimated collectible balance 
there have been occasions in the past where we recognized an expense associated with the rapid collapse of a distributor for which no specific reserve had been previously established 
the reserve requirements are based on the best facts available to us and are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received 
inventories we evaluate the realizability of our inventory on a product by product basis in light of sales demand  technological changes  product life cycle  component cost trends  product pricing  and inventory condition 
in circumstances where inventory levels are in excess of historical and anticipated market demand  where inventory is deemed technologically obsolete or not saleable due to condition  or where inventory cost exceeds net realizable value  we record a charge to cost of goods sold and reduce the inventory to its net realizable value 
deferred tax assets we recognize deferred tax assets resulting from tax credit carryforwards  net operating loss carryforwards  and deductible temporary differences between taxable income on our income tax returns and income before taxes under gaap 
deferred tax assets generally represent future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our consolidated financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is required when some portion or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
we are required to estimate taxable income in future years or develop tax strategies that would enable tax asset realization in each taxing jurisdiction and use judgment to determine whether to record a deferred tax asset valuation allowance for part or all of a deferred tax asset 
we consider the weight of all available evidence  both positive and negative  in assessing the realizability of the deferred tax assets associated with net operating losses 
we consider the reversals of existing taxable temporary differences as well as projections of future taxable income 
we consider the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences to the extent they were of the same character as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets 
we also consider whether the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences will occur in the same period and jurisdiction as the temporary differences giving rise to the deferred tax assets 
the assumptions utilized to estimate our future taxable income are consistent with those assumptions utilized for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment 
we also have significant tax credit carryforwards in the united states on which we have not recorded a valuation allowance 
the utilization of these credits is dependent upon the recognition of both us taxable income as well as income characterized as foreign source under the us tax laws 
the company expects to generate enough taxable income in the future to utilize these tax credits 
furthermore  in we expect to continue implementation of tax planning strategies that will help generate sufficient foreign source income in the carryforward period 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on expected income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our uncertain tax positions 
we establish accruals for uncertain tax positions when we believe that the full amount of the associated tax benefit may not be realized 
to the extent we were to prevail in 
table of contents matters for which accruals have been established or would be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  there could be a material effect on our income tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made 
in addition  our foreign subsidiaries undistributed income is considered to be indefinitely reinvested and  accordingly  we do not record a provision for united states federal and state income taxes on this foreign income 
if this income was not considered to be indefinitely reinvested  it would be subject to united states federal and state income taxes and could materially affect our income tax provision 
long lived assets the valuation and classification of long lived assets and the assignment of depreciation and amortization useful lives and salvage values involve significant judgments and the use of estimates 
the testing of these long lived assets under established accounting guidelines for impairment also requires significant use of judgment and assumptions  particularly as it relates to the identification of asset groups and reporting units and the determination of fair market value 
we test our tangible long lived assets and intangible long lived assets subject to amortization for impairment when indicators of impairment exist 
we test our goodwill and intangible long lived assets not subject to amortization for impairment on an annual basis during the fourth quarter or when indicators of impairment exist 
we base our estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable  but which are not predictable with precision and therefore are inherently uncertain 
actual future results could differ from these estimates 
for purposes of impairment testing of long lived assets  we have identified asset groups at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we do not amortize goodwill  but test it annually for impairment at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment  or a business unit one level below an operating segment the component level if discrete financial information for that business is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management 
however  components within an operating segment are aggregated as a single reporting unit if they have similar economic characteristics 
we determined that each of our reportable segments americas  emea  and asia pacific represents an operating segment 
within those operating segments  we have identified reporting units based on whether there is discrete financial information prepared that is regularly reviewed by segment management 
as a result of this evaluation  we have identified five reporting units within americas  four reporting units within emea  and three reporting units within asia pacific 
when we evaluate goodwill for impairment  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
we determine the fair value using the income approach as reconciled to our aggregate market capitalization 
under the income approach  we calculate the fair value of a reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using growth rates and discount rates that are consistent with current market conditions in our industry 
for example  in our goodwill impairment analysis  the discount rates for our reporting units ranged from to and the long term growth rates ranged from to 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets including goodwill assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s net assets including goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then an impairment of goodwill has occurred and we recognize an impairment loss for the difference between the carrying amount and the implied fair value of goodwill as a component of operating income 
accrued sales rebates we grant incentive rebates to participating distributors as part of our sales programs 
the rebates are determined based on certain targeted sales volumes 
rebates are paid quarterly or annually in either cash or receivables credits 
until we can process these rebates through individual customer records  we estimate the amount of outstanding rebates and recognize them as accrued liabilities and reductions in our gross revenues 
we base our estimates on both historical and anticipated sales demand and rebate program participation 
we charge revisions to these estimates back to accrued liabilities and revenues in the period in which the facts that give rise to each revision become known 
future market conditions and product transitions might require us to take actions to increase sales 
table of contents rebates offered  possibly resulting in an incremental increase in accrued liabilities and an incremental reduction in revenues at the time the rebate is offered 
pension and other postretirement benefits our pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on the various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions relate to discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  health care cost trend rates  and other factors 
we base the discount rate assumptions on current investment yields on high quality corporate long term bonds 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience and future or near term outlook 
long term return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results and management s expectation of the future economic environment 
our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook  and an assessment of likely long term trends 
our key assumptions are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of the lesser of of the projected benefit obligation or the fair market value of plan assets  amortized over the estimated future working life of the plan participants 
share based compensation we compensate certain employees and non employee directors with various forms of share based payment awards and recognize compensation costs for these awards based on their fair values 
the fair values of certain awards are estimated on the grant date using the black scholes merton option pricing formula  which incorporates certain assumptions regarding the expected term of an award and expected stock price volatility 
we develop the expected term assumption based on the vesting period and contractual term of an award  our historical exercise and post vesting cancellation experience  our stock price history  plan provisions that require exercise or cancellation of awards after employees terminate  and the extent to which currently available information indicates that the future is reasonably expected to differ from past experience 
we develop the expected volatility assumption based on historical price data for our common stock and other economic data trended into future years 
after calculating the aggregate fair value of an award  we use an estimated forfeiture rate to discount the amount of share based compensation cost to be recognized in our operating results over the service period of the award 
we develop the forfeiture assumption based on our historical pre vesting cancellation experience 
our key assumptions are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
business combination accounting we allocate the cost of an acquired entity to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values at the business combination date 
we also identify and estimate the fair values of intangible assets that should be recognized as assets apart from goodwill 
we have historically relied upon the use of third party valuation specialists to assist in the estimation of fair values for inventories  tangible long lived assets  and intangible assets other than goodwill 
the carrying values of acquired receivables and accounts payable have historically approximated their fair values at the business combination date 
with respect to accrued liabilities acquired  we use all available information to make our best estimates of their fair values at the business combination date 
when necessary  we rely upon the use of third party actuaries to assist in the estimation of fair value for certain liabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from currency exchange rates  certain commodity prices  interest rates  and credit extended to customers 
each of these risks is discussed below 
currency exchange rate risk for most of our products  the currency in which we sell the product is the same as the currency in which we incur the costs to manufacture the product  resulting in a natural hedge 
our currency exchange rate management strategy involves the use of natural techniques  where possible  such as the offsetting or netting of like currency cash flows 
we do not generally use foreign currency derivatives and did not have any outstanding at december  
table of contents we generally view our investments in international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the united states dollar as long term 
as a result  we do not generally use derivatives to manage these net investments 
in terms of foreign currency translation risk  we are exposed primarily to exchange rate movements between the united states dollar and the euro  canadian dollar  hong kong dollar  chinese yuan  mexican peso  australian dollar  and british pound 
our net foreign currency investment in foreign subsidiaries and affiliates translated into united states dollars using year end exchange rates was million and million at december  and  respectively 
we estimate a one percent change of the united states dollar relative to foreign currencies would have changed pre tax income loss of our foreign operations by approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis has inherent limitations as it assumes that rates of multiple foreign currencies will always move in the same direction relative to the value of the united states dollar over time 
commodity price risk certain raw materials used by us are subject to price volatility caused by supply conditions  political and economic variables  and other unpredictable factors 
the primary purpose of our commodity price management activities is to manage the volatility associated with purchases of commodities in the normal course of business 
we do not speculate on commodity prices 
we are exposed to price risk related to our purchase of copper used in the manufacture of our products 
our copper price management strategy involves the use of natural techniques  where possible  such as purchasing copper for future delivery at fixed prices 
we do not generally use commodity price derivatives and did not have any outstanding at december  the following table presents unconditional copper purchase obligations outstanding at december  the unconditional copper purchase obligations will settle during purchase fair amount value in thousands  except average price unconditional copper purchase obligations commitment volume in pounds weighted average price per pound commitment amounts we are also exposed to price risk related to our purchase of selected commodities derived from petrochemical feedstocks used in the manufacture of our products 
we generally purchase these commodities based upon market prices established with the vendors as part of the purchase process 
pricing of these commodities is volatile as they tend to fluctuate with the price of oil 
historically  we have not used commodity financial instruments to hedge prices for commodities derived from petrochemical feedstocks 
interest rate risk we have occasionally managed our debt portfolio by using interest rate derivative instruments  such as swap agreements  to achieve an overall desired position of fixed and floating rates 
during  we entered into and exited from interest rate derivative instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we were not a party to any interest rate derivative instruments at december  
table of contents the following table provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal amounts by expected maturity dates and fair values as of december  principal amount by expected maturity fair thereafter total value in thousands  except interest rates fixed rate senior subordinated notes average interest rate fixed rate senior subordinated notes average interest rate total concentrations of credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to these financial instruments 
we place cash and cash equivalents with various high quality financial institutions throughout the world  and exposure is limited at any one financial institution 
although we do not obtain collateral or other security to support these financial instruments  we evaluate the credit standing of the counterparty financial institutions 
at december   we had million in accounts receivable outstanding from anixter international inc anixter 
this represented approximately of our total accounts receivable outstanding at december  anixter generally pays all outstanding receivables within thirty to sixty days of invoice receipt
