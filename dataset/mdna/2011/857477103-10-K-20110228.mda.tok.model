table of contents financial highlights this section provides highlights with respect to our financial results for presented in the preceding table 
additional information is provided under consolidated results of operations  which follows this section 
our financial results for reflected the following during the second quarter of  we completed our acquisitions of intesa sanpaolo s securities services business may  and mourant international finance administration april  
for full year  from their respective acquisition dates through december   the acquired intesa and mifa businesses added in the aggregate approximately million of revenue and million of expenses  excluding merger and integration costs  to our consolidated statement of income 
we also recorded aggregate merger and integration costs of million in connection with these two acquisitions in  from their respective acquisition dates through december  see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item 
during the second quarter of  we recorded an aggregate pre tax charge of million  including associated legal costs of million  in our consolidated statement of income related to the following a pre tax charge of million to provide for a one time cash contribution to certain cash collateral pools and liquidity trusts underlying ssga managed investment funds engaged in securities lending see the investment management section under line of business information in this management s discussion and analysis  and a pre tax charge of million to establish a reserve to address potential inconsistencies in connection with our implementation of the redemption restrictions applicable to the cash collateral pools underlying our agency lending program see the securities finance section under consolidated results of operations total revenue in this management s discussion and analysis 
during the fourth quarter of  as previously reported  we recorded pre tax restructuring charges of approximately million in our consolidated statement of income  related primarily to a reduction in force of approximately  employees that began in december and is intended to be completed by the end of  as well as actions taken in to reduce our occupancy costs 
the charges were part of a global multi year program that began during the fourth quarter of  and which will include operational and information technology enhancements and targeted cost initiatives see the expenses section under consolidated results of operations in this management s discussion and analysis 
during the fourth quarter of  as previously reported  we recorded a pre tax loss of approximately million in our consolidated statement of income associated with the sale of approximately billion of mortgage and asset backed investment securities 
the securities were sold in connection with a repositioning of our investment portfolio to allow for enhanced capital ratios under evolving regulatory capital standards  increased balance sheet flexibility  and a reduction of our exposure to certain asset classes see the investment securities section under financial condition in this management s discussion and analysis 
total revenue increased compared to a increase in total fee revenue from levels and a increase in net interest revenue were partly offset by higher net losses related to investment securities  which resulted from the above mentioned securities portfolio repositioning completed during the fourth quarter of servicing and management fees were up and  respectively  from servicing fee revenue increased mainly due to the impact of new business  the addition of revenue from the acquired intesa and mifa businesses and improvement in equity market valuations 
management fee revenue increased primarily due to the improvement in equity markets as well as the impact of new business 
trading services revenue increased  primarily as a result of higher electronic trading revenues in brokerage and other fees  offset slightly by the impact of lower levels of foreign exchange trading volatility 
securities finance revenue was down as a result of continued lower spreads and securities lending demand 
processing fees and other revenue increased due to higher net revenue from structured products and higher net revenue related to certain tax advantaged investments 

table of contents in  we recorded net interest revenue of billion  which included million of discount accretion related to investment securities added to our consolidated statement of condition in connection with the may conduit consolidation see the net interest revenue section under consolidated results of operations in this management s discussion and analysis and note to the consolidated financial statements included under item 
net interest revenue increased on both a gaap and fully taxable equivalent basis the latter billion compared to billion  reflecting increases from tax equivalent adjustments of million and million  respectively 
these increases were primarily the result of the impact of the intesa deposits added in may in connection with that acquisition  spread improvement and increased volume associated with non us investment securities and higher discount accretion million for compared to million for  offset by a decreased spread on our long term cost of borrowing and spread compression in our floating rate investment securities 
net interest margin increased basis points  from in to in total expenses of billion increased from billion in  and included merger and integration costs of million associated with acquisitions  as well as the previously referenced pre tax charges of million related to our securities lending business and million related to our global multi year program 
expenses from operations of billion billion net of million delineated above increased compared to expenses from operations of billion billion net of million composed of a million provision for legal exposure and million of merger and integration costs  mainly as a result of increases in salaries and benefits expense associated with higher levels of incentive compensation accruals and the addition of expenses from the intesa and mifa acquisitions 
salaries and benefits expenses in were abnormally low  as we did not accrue cash incentive compensation for the first half of as part of our plan to increase tangible common equity 
for  net income available to common shareholders decreased to billion  or per diluted share  compared to net income before extraordinary loss available to common shareholders of billion  or per diluted share  for the after tax extraordinary loss of billion  or per diluted share  was related to the consolidation of the asset backed commercial paper conduits completed in may return on common equity was compared to for  the latter before the extraordinary loss 
during  we won mandates for approximately trillion in assets to be serviced  of the total  billion was installed prior to december   with the remainder expected to be installed in subsequent periods 
the new business not installed by december  was not included in assets under custody and administration at that date  and had no impact on servicing fee revenue for  as the assets are not included until their installation is complete and we begin to service them 
once installed  the assets generate servicing fee revenue in subsequent periods 
we will provide various services for these assets including accounting  fund administration  custody  foreign exchange  securities finance  transfer agency  performance analytics  compliance reporting and monitoring  hedge fund servicing  private equity administration  real estate administration  depository banking services  wealth management services and investment manager operations outsourcing 
consolidated results of operations this section discusses our consolidated results of operations for compared to  and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included under item a comparison of consolidated results of operations for with those for is provided in the comparison of and section of this management s discussion and analysis 

table of contents total revenue years ended december  change dollars in millions fee revenue servicing fees management fees trading services securities finance processing fees and other total fee revenue net interest revenue interest revenue interest expense net interest revenue gains losses related to investment securities  net gain on sale of citistreet interest  net of exit and other associated costs total revenue our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue 
fee revenue generated by our investment servicing and investment management businesses is augmented by securities finance  trading services and processing fees and other revenue 
we earn net interest revenue from client deposits and short term investment activities by providing deposit services and short term investment vehicles  such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper  to meet clients needs for high grade liquid investments  and investing these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate 
fee revenue servicing and management fees collectively composed approximately of our total fee revenue for and for these fees are influenced by several factors  including the mix and volume of assets under custody and administration and assets under management  securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions  and the types of products and services used by clients  and are generally affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income security valuations 
generally  servicing fees are affected  in part  by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody and administration  while management fees are affected by changes in month end valuations of assets under management 
additional factors  such as the level of transaction volumes  changes in service level  balance credits  client minimum balances  pricing concessions and other factors  may have a significant effect on servicing fee revenue 
generally  management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue 
management fees for enhanced index and actively managed products are generally earned at higher rates than those for passive products 
enhanced index and actively managed products may also involve performance fee arrangements 
performance fees are generated when the performance of certain managed funds exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements 
generally  we experience more volatility with performance fees than with more traditional management fees 
in light of the above  we estimate  assuming all other factors remain constant  that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 
if fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by  we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately in our total revenue 
we would expect the foregoing relationships to exist in normalized financial markets  which we have not experienced since mid the disrupted conditions that began during the second half of have adversely affected our market driven revenues  particularly those from foreign exchange trading services and securities finance 
even though the financial markets began to 
table of contents improve during the second half of  the effect of the disrupted conditions on our total revenue  particularly our market driven revenue  has been more significant through than we would anticipate in normalized markets 
the following table presents selected equity market indices for the years ended december  and daily averages and the averages of month end indices demonstrate worldwide changes in equity market valuations that affect servicing and management fee revenue  respectively

we are the largest provider of mutual fund custody and accounting services in the us we distinguish ourselves from other mutual fund service providers by offering customers a broad array of integrated products and services  including accounting  daily pricing and fund administration 
we calculate more than of the us mutual fund prices provided to nasdaq that appear daily in the wall street journal and other publications with an accuracy rate of 
we service us tax exempt assets for corporate and public pension funds  and we provide trust and valuation services for more than  daily priced portfolios 
we are a service provider outside of the us as well

in the uk  we provide custody services for pension fund assets and administration services for mutual fund assets 
we service approximately billion of offshore assets  primarily domiciled in ireland  luxembourg and toronto 
we have more than billion in assets under administration in the asia pacific region  and in japan  we hold approximately of the trust assets held by non domestic trust banks in that region 
we are an alternative asset servicing provider worldwide  with approximately billion of assets under administration 
we are also a hedge fund administration provider worldwide  as well as a worldwide provider of private equity administration services and real estate administration services 

table of contents the increase in servicing fees from primarily resulted from the impact of new business awarded to us and installed during and prior periods on current period revenue  the addition of revenue generated by the acquired intesa and mifa businesses from may and april  respectively  through december and increases in daily average equity market valuations 
for  servicing fees generated outside the us were approximately of total servicing fees compared to approximately for at year end  our total assets under custody and administration were trillion  compared to trillion a year earlier 
the increase compared to was primarily the result of increases in equity market valuations and a higher level of new servicing business won and installed prior to december   as well as the effects of the intesa and mifa acquisitions 
these asset levels as of year end did not reflect new business awarded to us during that had not been installed prior to december  the value of assets under custody and administration is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served 
changes in the values of assets under custody and administration do not necessarily result in proportional changes in our servicing fee revenue 
assets under custody and administration consisted of the following as of december assets under custody and administration as of december  annual growth rate compound annual growth rate dollars in billions mutual funds collective funds pension products insurance and other products total financial instrument mix of assets under custody and administration as of december  in billions equities fixed income short term and other investments total geographic mix of assets under custody and administration as of december  in billions united states other americas europe middle east africa asia pacific total geographic mix is based on the location at which the assets are custodied or serviced 
management fees through state street global advisors  or ssga  we provide a broad range of investment management strategies  specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations  public funds  and other sophisticated investors 
based on assets under management  ssga is the largest manager 
table of contents of institutional assets worldwide  the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations primarily pension plans in the us  and the third largest investment manager overall in the world 
ssga offers a broad array of investment management strategies  including passive and active  such as enhanced indexing and hedge fund strategies  using quantitative and fundamental methods for both us and global equities and fixed income securities 
ssga also offers exchange traded funds  or etfs  such as the spdr etf brand 
the increase in management fees from resulted primarily from the impact of increases in average month end equity market valuations and  to a lesser extent  the impact of new business won and installed in prior periods on current period revenue 
average month end equity market valuations  individually presented in the foregoing index table  were up an average of compared to management fees generated outside the us were approximately of total management fees for  down from for at year end  assets under management were trillion  compared to trillion at year end such amounts include assets of the spdr gold etf  for which we act as distribution agent rather than investment manager  and certain assets managed for the us government under programs adopted during the financial crisis 
while certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed  management fees reflect other factors as well  including our relationship pricing for clients who use multiple services  and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees 
during  we benefited from the continued focus in the institutional markets on passive strategies  particularly passive equities and exchange traded funds  where we had year to year increases in assets under management of and  respectively 
these increases were partly offset by continued weakness in our sales of active products and a reduction in managed cash balances  which in part reflected the effect of reductions of securities lending volumes associated with continued weak loan demand 
the overall increase in assets under management at december  compared to december   which can be seen in the tables that follow this discussion  reflected appreciation in the values of the assets managed  partly offset by a net loss of asset management business 
our levels of assets under management were affected by a number of factors  including reaction to prior issues related to ssga s active fixed income strategies  restrictions on redemptions related to funds engaged in securities lending  and the relative under performance of certain of our passive equity products 
the net loss of business of billion for presented in the table on page does not reflect new business awarded to us during that had not been installed prior to december  this new business will be reflected in assets under management in future periods after installation  and will generate management fee revenue in subsequent periods

the following table presents a roll forward of assets under management for the three years ended december assets under management years ended december  in billions balance at beginning of year net new business market appreciation depreciation balance at end of year trading services trading services revenue includes revenue from foreign exchange trading and brokerage and other trading services 
we offer a complete range of foreign exchange services under an account model that focuses on the global requirements of our clients for our proprietary research and the execution of trades in any time zone 

table of contents foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors the volume and type of client foreign exchange transactions  currency volatility  and the management of currency market risks 
for  foreign exchange trading revenue totaled million  a decrease from revenue of million in  primarily the result of lower spreads on foreign exchange trades and a decline in currency volatility  partly offset by higher client volumes 
of our total foreign exchange trading revenue for was earned in the second and fourth quarters  and such revenue for the fourth quarter increased compared to the third quarter 
we also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community  including transition management  commission recapture and self directed brokerage 
these products are differentiated by our position as an agent of the institutional investor 
brokerage and other trading fees of million were higher compared to million in  with the increase largely attributable to higher electronic trading volumes 
securities finance our securities finance business consists of two components investment funds with a broad range of investment objectives which are managed by ssga and engage in agency securities lending  which we refer to as the ssga lending funds  and an agency lending program for third party investment managers and asset owners  which we refer to as the agency lending funds 
additional information with respect to the ssga lending funds is also provided under line of business information investment management in this management s discussion and analysis 
our securities finance business provides liquidity to the financial markets  as well as an effective means for clients to earn incremental revenue on their securities portfolios 
by acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers  we lend securities and provide liquidity to clients worldwide 
borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to state street in return for loaned securities 
borrowers are generally required to provide collateral equal to a contractually agreed percentage equal to or in excess of the fair value of the loaned securities 
as the fair value of the loaned securities changes  additional collateral is provided by the borrower or collateral is returned to the borrower 
such movements are typically referred to as daily mark to market collateral adjustments 
we also participate in securities lending transactions as a principal  rather than an agent 
as principal  we borrow securities from the lending client and then lend such securities to the subsequent borrower  either a state street client or a broker dealer 
our involvement as principal is utilized when the lending client is unable to transact directly with the market and requires us to execute the transaction and furnish the securities 
we provide our credit rating to the transaction as well as our ability to source securities through our assets under custody and administration 
for cash collateral  our clients pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral  and we invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles or managed accounts as directed by the owner of the loaned securities 
in some cases  the investment vehicles or managed accounts may be managed by ssga 
the spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and state street as agent 
for non cash collateral  the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities  and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and state street 
securities finance revenue  composed of our split of both the spreads related to cash collateral and the fees related to non cash collateral  is principally a function of the volume of securities on loan and the interest rate spreads and fees earned on the underlying collateral 
for  securities finance revenue decreased from  substantially the result of lower spreads across all lending programs  as average lending volumes were essentially flat year to year billion for compared to billion for 
beginning in  the market value per unit of the assets held in the certain of the collateral pools underlying both the agency lending program and ssga lending funds fell below 
however  we continued to transact purchases into and redemptions out of these pools at per unit and imposed restrictions on redemptions from the ssga lending funds and certain of the agency lending collateral pools 

table of contents we continued to transact purchase and redemptions at per unit for a number of reasons  including that none of the securities in the cash collateral pools was then in default or considered to be materially impaired  and that restrictions on withdrawals from the agency lending collateral pools were and are in place  which  absent a substantial reduction in the lending program  should permit the securities in the collateral pools to be held until they recover to their par value 
during  we took several actions to seek a resolution to these issues in june  we contributed million to the collateral pools and liquidity trusts underlying the ssga lending funds  eliminating the difference between the market value and amortized cost of the assets held by such vehicles as of june  in june  as a result of a review of the implementation of our policy restricting redemptions from certain agency lending collateral pools  and based on our assessment of the amount required to compensate clients for the dilutive effect of redemptions which may not have been consistent with the intent of the policy  we recorded a pre tax charge of million to address these potential inconsistencies 
in august  ssga removed the redemption restrictions from the ssga lending funds 
in the period subsequent to the elimination of the redemption restrictions  some clients that invested in ssga lending funds transitioned their assets to other ssga products that did not engage in securities lending  or  to a lesser degree  other investment managers 
as a result of the elimination of the redemption restrictions and reduced utilization of lendable assets in the ssga lending funds  the aggregate net assets of the collateral pools underlying the ssga lending funds declined to billion as of december  from billion as of december  in december  we divided certain agency lending collateral pools into liquidity and duration pools  and in january  we removed the redemption restrictions from the liquidity pools 
these actions were taken to provide greater flexibility to participants with respect to their control of their level of participation in our agency lending program 
as of december   the aggregate net assets of these liquidity pools and duration pools were billion and billion  respectively  and the return obligations of participants in the agency lending program represented by interests in the duration pools exceeded the market value of the assets in the duration pools by approximately million  which amount is expected to be eliminated as the assets in the duration pools mature or amortize 
market influences continued to affect our revenue from  and the profitability of  our securities lending activities during  and may do so in future periods 
while the average volume of securities on loan has generally stabilized over the past two years  spreads have declined significantly compared to those earned in late and throughout which were extraordinarily high  reflecting prevailing interest rates and the effects of government actions taken to stimulate the economy 
the actions taken during outlined above are expected to provide an opportunity for increased securities lending volumes  although their effect will be influenced by overall market and client specific factors and could  particularly in the short term  result in decreased lending volumes 
as long as securities lending spreads remain below the more normal levels generally experienced prior to late  client demand is likely to remain at a reduced level and our revenues from our securities lending activities will be adversely affected relative to the revenues we earned in  which were extraordinarily high and while these actions are also intended to address client issues  we do not know at this time how our agency lending clients will react to these measures 
for additional information  refer to risk factors included under item a 
as previously disclosed  in  we determined that withdrawals by two related participants in one of the agency lending collateral pools were inconsistent with our redemption restrictions 
in response  we redeemed in kind the remaining units of such participants  effectively distributing  together with prior cash withdrawals  the same amount of cash and longer dated securities that the participants would have received under the redemption restrictions 
we are in litigation with these participants  see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item we also undertook a review of our implementation of the redemption restrictions with respect to other participants in the agency lending collateral pools 
this review identified the potential inconsistencies  referenced above  in connection with our implementation of the redemption policy 

table of contents processing fees and other processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and revenue  including fees from our structured products business  fees from software licensing and maintenance  equity income from our joint venture investments  gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets  and amortization of our investments in tax advantaged financings 
processing fees and other revenue was million for  an increase of compared to this increase primarily resulted from higher net revenue from structured products  including fees from our tax exempt investment program  and higher net revenue related to certain tax advantaged investments

additional information about our silo lease transactions is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item amounts included fully taxable equivalent adjustments of million for  million for and million for 
table of contents net interest revenue is defined as the total of interest revenue earned on interest earning assets less interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
interest earning assets  which principally consist of investment securities  interest bearing deposits with banks  repurchase agreements  loans and leases  and other liquid assets  are financed primarily by client deposits and short term borrowings 
net interest margin represents the relationship between fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue and total average interest earning assets for the period 
revenue that is exempt from income taxes  mainly that earned from certain investment securities state and political subdivisions  is adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis using a federal income tax rate of  adjusted for applicable state income taxes  net of the related federal tax benefit 
changes in the components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities are discussed in more detail below 
additional detail about the components of interest revenue and interest expense is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item for  on both a gaap and a fully taxable equivalent basis  net interest revenue increased compared to with fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue reflective of increases from tax equivalent adjustments of million and million  respectively 
if the discount accretion related to former conduit securities  more fully described below  is excluded  fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue for increased to billion billion presented in the preceding table less accretion of million from billion billion presented in the preceding table less accretion of million  an increase of 
the increase was primarily the result of the impact of a higher portfolio allocation to fixed rate investment securities  us and us investment portfolio growth  and the impact of the intesa deposits added in may in connection with that acquisition  partly offset by lower spreads on both floating rate investment securities and non us transaction deposits 
in may  we elected to take actions that required the consolidation onto our balance sheet  for financial reporting purposes  of the assets and liabilities of the asset backed commercial paper conduits that we sponsored and administered 
upon consolidation  the aggregate fair value of the conduits investment securities of approximately billion on the date of consolidation was established as their carrying amount  resulting in a billion discount to the assets aggregate par value of approximately billion 
to the extent that the expected future cash flows from the securities held by us exceed their carrying amount  the portion of the discount not related to credit will accrete into interest revenue over the securities remaining terms 
subsequent to the may consolidation  we have recorded aggregate discount accretion in interest revenue of billion million in and million in 
the timing and ultimate recognition of accretion depends  in part  on factors that are outside of our control  including anticipated prepayment speeds and credit quality 
the impact of these factors is uncertain and can be significantly influenced by general economic and financial market conditions 
the timing and recognition of accretion can also be influenced by our ongoing management of the risk and other characteristics associated with our investment portfolio  including any resulting sales of securities from which we would otherwise generate accretion 
as we discussed in the overview of financial results financial highlights section of this management s discussion and analysis  and as more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item  during the fourth quarter of  we sold approximately billion of mortgage and asset backed investment securities  including billion of former conduit securities  to reposition our investment portfolio and allow for enhanced capital ratios under evolving regulatory capital standards  increased balance sheet flexibility  and a reduction of our exposure to certain asset classes 
depending on the factors discussed above  among others  we anticipate that  until the former conduit securities remaining in our portfolio mature or are sold  discount accretion will affect our net interest revenue  and may increase the volatility of our net interest revenue and margin  however  the portfolio repositioning resulted in a significant decrease in the accretion that we expect to recognize in future periods 
assuming that we hold the remaining former conduit securities to maturity  all other things equal  we expect the former conduit securities carried in our investment portfolio as of december  to generate aggregate accretion in future periods of approximately billion over their remaining terms 
interest bearing deposits with banks  including cash balances held at the federal reserve to satisfy reserve requirements  averaged billion for  a decrease of compared to billion for an 
table of contents average of billion was held at the federal reserve bank during  a decrease of compared to billion for  with balances in both periods exceeding minimum reserve requirements 
the overall decreases in both comparisons reflected excess liquidity held by us during due to the then ongoing financial markets instability that was re allocated to higher yielding investment securities 
average securities purchased under resale agreements decreased from billion for to billion for  mainly due to lower client demand for short term investment 
average trading account assets declined from billion for to million for  due to the absence of conduit asset backed commercial paper purchased by us  which was eliminated for financial reporting purposes when the conduits were consolidated onto our balance sheet in may as previously described 
our average investment securities portfolio increased from billion for to approximately billion for  generally the result of the continued execution of our re investment strategy that we began in the second half of  partly offset by maturities and sales of securities during the year 
in addition  as described earlier in this section  we repositioned our portfolio in december by selling approximately billion of mortgage and asset backed securities 
by the end of  we had re invested approximately billion of the proceeds from the repositioning  primarily in agency mortgage backed securities 
as of december   securities rated aaa and aa comprised approximately of our investment securities portfolio approximately rated aaa  compared to aaa and aa rated approximately rated aaa as of december   with the improvement primarily due to the repositioning 
loans and leases averaged billion for  up from billion for the increase was primarily due to increased client demand for short term liquidity and the addition of structured asset backed loans in connection with the may conduit consolidation 
approximately of the average loan and lease portfolio  compared to for  was composed of us and us short duration advances that provided liquidity to clients in support of their transaction flows  which averaged approximately billion for  up from billion for us short duration advances averaged approximately billion for  down compared to billion for average non us short duration advances increased to billion for  mainly due to activity associated with clients added in connection with the intesa acquisition 
average interest bearing deposits increased  from billion to billion for compared to the increases reflected the deposits added in connection with the intesa acquisition  partly offset by the return of client deposits to levels more consistent with those experienced prior to late average other short term borrowings decreased to billion for  primarily due to the absence of borrowings under the federal reserve s term auction facility  which is further discussed in the liquidity section under financial condition in this management s discussion and analysis 
average long term debt increased to billion for  as a result of the full year impact of the issuance of an aggregate of approximately billion of unsecured senior notes by state street and state street bank in march under the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program  as well as the may issuance of unsecured senior notes  partly offset by a subordinated debt maturity in several factors could affect future levels of our net interest revenue and margin  including the mix of client liabilities  actions of the various central banks  changes in us and us interest rates  the shapes of the various yield curves around the world  the amount of discount accretion generated by the former conduit securities that remain in our investment portfolio discussed earlier in this section  and the relative impact of the yields earned on the securities purchased by us with the proceeds from the portfolio repositioning compared to the yields earned on the securities sold 
in the second half of  based on market conditions  we re initiated our strategy of re investing proceeds from amortizing and maturing securities into highly rated investment securities  such as us treasuries and federal agency mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities 
the pace at which we continue to re invest and the types of securities purchased will depend on market conditions over time 
these factors and the level of interest rates worldwide are expected to dictate what effect the re investment program will have on future levels of our net interest revenue and net interest margin 

table of contents gains losses related to investment securities  net in connection with our ongoing management of the investment portfolio  we may  from time to time  sell investment securities  including former conduit securities  to manage risk  to reduce our risk profile  to take advantage of favorable market conditions  or for other reasons 
in  we recorded net realized losses of million from sales of approximately billion of investment securities  compared to net realized gains of million from sales of approximately billion of investment securities in the million of net sale losses realized during included the million net realized loss that resulted from the investment portfolio repositioning described below 
for  billion of net gains were realized from sales of billion of former conduit securities  composed of gross realized gains of billion and gross realized losses of million 
for  million of net gains were realized from sales of million of former conduit securities  composed of gross realized gains of million and gross realized losses of million 
in december  we undertook a repositioning of our investment securities portfolio by selling approximately billion of securities  composed of billion of asset backed securities  billion of non agency mortgage backed securities and billion of mortgage backed securities 
the repositioning was undertaken to enhance our capital ratios under evolving regulatory capital standards  increase our balance sheet flexibility in deploying our capital  and reduce our exposure to certain asset classes 
the sale resulted in a pre tax loss of approximately million  which was recorded in our consolidated statement of income and is reflected in the million of net sale losses described in the preceding paragraph 
the repositioning included the sale of approximately billion of former conduit securities at a net realized gain of million 
of the billion of securities sold in the repositioning  approximately billion were classified as held to maturity in our consolidated statement of condition 
additional information about the sale  including the held to maturity portion  is included in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item the aggregate unrealized loss on securities for which other than temporary impairment was recorded in was million 
of this total  million related to factors other than credit  and was recognized  net of taxes  as a component of other comprehensive income in our consolidated statement of condition 
we recorded losses from other than temporary impairment related to credit of the remaining million in our consolidated statement of income  compared to million in  which resulted from our assessment of impairment 
for  the substantial majority of the impairment losses related to non agency mortgage backed securities which management concluded had experienced credit losses resulting from deterioration in financial performance of those securities during the year

table of contents management regularly reviews the investment securities portfolio to identify other than temporary impairment of individual securities 
pursuant to the provisions of new gaap  which we adopted on april   impairment related to expected losses represents the difference between the discounted values of the expected future cash flows from the securities compared to their current amortized cost basis  with each discount rate commensurate with the effective yield on the underlying security 
for debt securities held to maturity  other than temporary impairment remaining after credit related impairment which credit related impairment is recorded in our consolidated statement of income is recognized  net of taxes  as a component of other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheet  and is accreted prospectively over the remaining terms of the securities based on the timing of their estimated future cash flows 
for other than temporary impairment of debt securities that results from management s decision to sell the security prior to its recovery in value  the entire difference between the security s fair value and its amortized cost basis is recorded in our consolidated statement of income 
prior to our adoption of new gaap on april   we recognized losses from other than temporary impairment of debt and equity securities for either a change in management s intent to hold the securities or expected credit losses  and such impairment losses  which reflected the entire difference between the fair value and amortized cost basis of each individual security  were recorded in our consolidated statement of income 
additional information about investment securities  the gross gains and losses that compose the net sale gains and our process to identify other than temporary impairment  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item provision for loan losses we recorded provisions for loan losses of million in and million in the substantial majority of the provisions recorded in both years resulted from changes in expectations with respect to future cash flows from certain of the commercial real estate loans acquired in in connection with indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of lehman as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy 
the commercial real estate loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis  and any provisions for loan losses that are recorded reflect management s current expectations with respect to future cash flows from these loans  based on an assessment of economic conditions in the commercial real estate market and other factors 
future changes in expectations with respect to these loans could result in additional provisions for loan losses

transaction processing services expenses  which are volume related and include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement  sub custodian services and external contract services  increased due to higher levels of sub custody expenses and higher external contract services costs related to increases in transaction volumes 
on june   we recorded an aggregate pre tax charge of million  which included million of associated legal costs 
the charge provided for a one time cash contribution of million to the cash collateral pools and liquidity trusts underlying the ssga lending funds  which reflected the cost to us to restore the net asset value per unit of such collateral pools to as of june  as a result of this contribution  ssga removed the redemption restrictions from these ssga lending funds in august we also established a million reserve to address potential inconsistencies in connection with our implementation of redemption restrictions applicable to the collateral pools underlying our agency lending program 
our decision with respect to the one time cash contribution was based on many factors  including our assessment with respect to previously disclosed asserted and unasserted claims and our evaluation of the ultimate resolution of such claims  as well as the effect of the redemption restrictions originally imposed by ssga on the lending funds 
the contribution was not the result of any obligation by state street to support the ssga lending funds or the underlying collateral pools 
state street has no obligation to provide cash or other support to the ssga lending funds or the collateral pools underlying the ssga lending funds at any future date  and has no intention to provide any such support associated with realized or unrealized losses in the collateral pools that may arise in the future 

table of contents the million reserve was based on the results of a review of our implementation of the redemption restrictions with respect to participants in the agency lending collateral pools  and our assessment of the amount required to compensate clients for the dilutive effect of redemptions which may not have been consistent with the intent of the policy 
in november  we announced a global multi year program designed to enhance service excellence and innovation  deliver increased efficiencies in our operating model and position us for accelerated growth 
the program includes operational and information technology enhancements and targeted cost initiatives  including planned reductions in staff and a plan to reduce our occupancy costs 
to implement this program  we expect to recognize aggregate restructuring charges of approximately million to million over four years  beginning with the fourth quarter of in connection with the program  we recorded restructuring charges of million during the fourth quarter of  and initiated a reduction of  employees  or approximately of our global workforce  which we plan to have substantially completed by the end of the fourth quarter charges also included costs related to actions taken to reduce our occupancy costs through real estate consolidation 
excluding related restructuring charges  we expect that the program will result in an annualized reduction of our expenses from operations of between approximately million and million by the end of additional information with respect to the charges  and activity during in the related balance sheet reserve  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item during  we recorded merger and integration costs of million  with million related to intesa and mifa 
these costs consisted only of certain transaction related costs and direct incremental costs to integrate the acquired businesses into our operations  and did not include ongoing expenses of the combined organization 
additional information about these costs is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item the decrease in aggregate other expenses professional services  amortization of other intangible assets  securities processing  regulator fees and assessments  and other for compared to resulted primarily from the impact of an adverse judgment of million rendered by a netherlands court in  the impact of million of insurance recoveries received in and lower levels of fdic assessments 
this overall decrease was offset slightly by a higher level of other intangible assets amortization associated with the intesa and mifa acquisitions 
the million of insurance recoveries that reduced other expenses for was received with respect to settlement payments made by us to clients in prior periods in connection with certain active fixed income strategies managed by ssga prior to august we account for insurance recoveries as gains in accordance with gaap  and therefore do not record the gains until the cash is received 
income taxes we recorded income tax expense of million for  compared to income tax expense before extraordinary loss of million for our effective tax rate for was compared to for the difference in the tax rates was primarily attributable to the restructuring of former non us conduit assets in the second quarter of  the partial write off of a deferred tax asset associated with certain of the investment securities sold in connection with the portfolio repositioning completed in the fourth quarter of  and the absence of the impact of the non deductible portion of the ssga related legal reserve established in information about income tax contingencies related to our silo lease transactions is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item line of business information we have two lines of business investment servicing and investment management

table of contents investment servicing total revenue for increased from and total fee revenue increased in the same comparison 
the increases in total fee revenue generally related to servicing fees and processing fees and other revenue  partly offset by a decline in securities finance revenue 
servicing fees increased primarily as a result of the impact on current period revenue of new business awarded to us and installed during and prior periods  the addition of revenue from the acquired intesa and mifa businesses and increases in daily average equity market valuations 
processing fees and other revenue increased primarily as a result of higher net revenue from structured products  including fees from our tax exempt investment program  and higher net revenue related to certain tax advantaged investments 
trading services revenue was essentially flat compared to  as higher brokerage and other fees attributable to higher levels of electronic trading volumes were offset by lower revenue from foreign exchange trades  caused primarily by lower spreads  and declines in volatility  partly offset by higher client volumes 
securities finance revenue declined primarily as a result of compression of credit spreads and slightly lower volumes of assets on loan associated with continued low levels of client demand 
servicing fees  trading services revenue and gains losses related to investment securities  net  for our investment servicing business line are identical to the respective consolidated results 
refer to the servicing fees  trading services and gains losses related to investment securities  net sections under total revenue in this management s discussion and analysis for a more in depth discussion 
a discussion of processing fees and other revenue is provided in the processing fees and other section under total revenue 
net interest revenue increased compared to  primarily as a result of higher levels of investment securities associated with our re investment strategy and the impact of the intesa deposits added in may in connection with that acquisition 
a portion of net interest revenue is recorded in the investment management business line based on the volume of client liabilities attributable to that business 
total expenses increased from  primarily because of the absence of cash incentive compensation accruals during the first six months of  as we did not accrue such compensation as part of our plan to increase our tangible common equity  and the addition of expenses from the acquired intesa and mifa businesses 
investment management total revenue for decreased compared to  generally reflective of the impact of decreases in total fee revenue  as increases in management fees and processing and other revenue were more than offset by a decline in securities finance revenue 
the increase in management fees  generated by ssga  resulted from the impact of increases in average month end equity market valuations and  to a lesser extent  the impact on current period revenue of new business won and installed in prior periods 
securities finance revenue declined because of lower spreads across all lending programs  reduced utilization of lendable assets in the ssga lending funds and the transition of assets by clients from lending to non lending products 
management fees for the investment management business line are identical to the respective consolidated results 
refer to the management fees section under total revenue in this management s discussion and analysis for a more in depth discussion 
total expenses increased from  primarily the result of the securities lending charge  discussed below  partly offset by the absence of the provision for legal exposure related to ssga managed fixed income strategies 
beginning in  the market value per unit of the assets held in certain of the collateral pools underlying the ssga lending funds fell below 
however  we continued to transact purchases into and redemptions out of these pools at per unit and imposed restrictions on redemptions from the ssga lending funds 
we continued to transact purchase and redemptions at per unit for a number of reasons  including that none of the securities in the collateral pools was then in default or considered to be materially impaired  and that withdrawals from the collateral pools were restricted  which  absent a substantial reduction in the lending program  should permit the securities in the collateral pools to be held until they recover to their par value 

table of contents in june  to seek a resolution of these issues  we made a one time cash contribution of million to the collateral pools and liquidity trusts underlying the ssga lending funds  eliminating the difference between the market value and amortized cost of the assets held by such vehicles as of june  consequently  in august  ssga removed the redemption restrictions from the ssga lending funds 
in the period subsequent to the elimination of the redemption restrictions  some clients that invested in ssga lending funds transitioned their assets to other ssga products that did not engage in securities lending  or  to a lesser degree  other investment managers 
as a result of the elimination of the redemption restrictions and reduced utilization of lendable assets in the ssga lending funds  the aggregate net assets of the collateral pools underlying the ssga lending funds declined to approximately billion as of december  from approximately billion as of december  our decision with respect to the cash contribution was based on many factors  including our assessment relative to previously disclosed asserted and unasserted claims and our evaluation of the ultimate resolution of such claims  as well as the effect of the redemption restrictions originally imposed by ssga on the lending funds 
the contribution was not the result of any obligation by state street to support the ssga lending funds or the underlying collateral pools 
state street has no obligation to provide cash or other support to the ssga lending fund or the collateral pools underlying the ssga lending funds at any future date  and has no intention to provide any such support associated with realized or unrealized losses in the collateral pools that may arise in the future

trading services revenue declined primarily as a result of a decline in client volumes and currency volatility  partly offset by an increase in brokerage and other trading fees from growth in fixed income transition management and equity trading  as well as an increase in electronic trading revenues attributable to higher volumes 
securities finance revenue was down as a result of compression of spreads and lower lending volumes 
processing fees and other revenue declined due to lower product related revenue from deposit services and structured products  the latter specifically our tax exempt investment and conduit commercial paper programs

information systems and communications expense increased due to higher levels of spending on telecommunications hardware and software 
transaction processing services expenses decreased due to lower volumes in the investment servicing business and lower costs related to external contract services 

table of contents the provision for legal exposure of million resulted from an increase in the reserve initially established in associated with certain active fixed income strategies managed by ssga 
we settled regulatory inquiries related to this exposure in february during  we elected to provide support to certain investment accounts managed by ssga through the purchase of asset and mortgage backed securities and a cash infusion  which resulted in an income statement provision of million 
in addition  as referenced above  we announced a reduction in force and related actions designed to reduce our operating costs  and recorded aggregate restructuring charges of million 
in  in connection with the investors financial acquisition  we recorded merger and integration costs of million  compared to million for these costs consisted only of certain transaction related costs and direct incremental costs to integrate the acquired investors financial business into our operations  primarily related to employee retention and system and client integration  and did not include ongoing expenses of the combined organization 
during the second half of  lehman brothers and certain of its affiliates filed for bankruptcy or other insolvency proceedings 
while we had no unsecured financial exposure to lehman or its affiliates  we indemnified certain clients in connection with collateralized repurchase agreements with lehman entities 
in the then current market environment  the market value of the underlying collateral had declined  and to the extent that these declines resulted in aggregate collateral value falling below the aggregate indemnification obligation  we recorded a balance sheet reserve  and a corresponding provision  of million in our consolidated statement of income to provide for our estimated net exposure 
the reserve was based on the cost of satisfying the indemnification obligation net of the fair value of the collateral  which we acquired subsequent to the lehman proceedings 
the collateral  composed of commercial real estate loans  was recorded in loans and leases in our consolidated statement of condition 
the decrease in aggregate other expenses professional services  amortization of other intangible assets and other costs for compared to resulted primarily from a decrease in securities processing costs due to lower processing volume and a decrease in professional services spending  primarily legal and consulting costs 
this overall decrease was offset slightly by higher regulatory assessments associated with the increased cost of deposit insurance 
income taxes the decrease in income tax expense for compared to resulted from an increase in the proportion of earnings from certain of our non us subsidiaries  where management s intention is to reinvest those earnings indefinitely overseas  consistent with our business strategy to pursue growth in non us markets 
this strategy allowed us to reduce taxes accrued with respect to earnings  as well as certain taxes accrued in prior periods 
the overall effective tax rate for was compared to for significant accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  and we apply accounting policies that affect the determination of amounts reported in these financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item the majority of the accounting policies described in note do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application  or the variability of the estimates is not material to our consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of these accounting policies  by their nature  require management to make judgments  involving significant estimates and assumptions  about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and changes in this information over time could materially affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements 
based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying estimates and assumptions  the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by state street have been identified by management as those associated with fair value measurements  interest revenue recognition and other than 
table of contents temporary impairment  and goodwill and other intangible assets 
these accounting policies require the most subjective or complex judgments  and underlying estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
an understanding of the judgments  estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
the following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting policies 
management of state street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the examining audit committee of our board of directors 
fair value measurements we carry certain of our financial assets and liabilities at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis  including trading account assets  investment securities available for sale and various types of derivative instruments 
as discussed in further detail below  changes in the fair value of these financial assets and liabilities are recorded either as components of our consolidated statement of income  or as components of other comprehensive income within shareholders equity in our consolidated statement of condition 
in addition to those financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated financial statements on a recurring basis  we estimate the fair values of other financial assets and liabilities that we carry at amortized cost in our consolidated statement of condition  and we disclose these fair value estimates in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the fair values of these financial assets and liabilities using the definition of fair value described below 
at december   approximately billion of our financial assets and approximately billion of our financial liabilities were carried at fair value on a recurring basis  compared to billion and billion  respectively  at december  the amounts at december  represented approximately of our consolidated total assets and approximately of our consolidated total liabilities  compared to and  respectively  at december  the increase in the relative percentage of consolidated total assets at december  resulted primarily from purchases of mortgage backed and other debt securities as part of our continued re investment strategy  partly offset by the net impact of the december investment portfolio repositioning 
the increase in the relative percentage of consolidated total liabilities as of december  generally resulted from higher levels of derivatives related to our foreign exchange activities 
additional information with respect to the assets and liabilities carried by us at fair value on a recurring basis is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item gaap defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for an asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
when we measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities  we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact  and we consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
when possible  we look to active and observable markets to measure the fair value of identical  or similar  financial assets or liabilities 
when identical financial assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets  we look to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities 
in some instances  certain assets and liabilities are not actively traded in observable markets  and as a result we use alternate valuation techniques to measure their fair value 
in accordance with gaap  we categorize the financial assets and liabilities that we carry at fair value in our consolidated statement of condition on a recurring basis based upon a prescribed three level valuation hierarchy 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to valuation methods using significant unobservable inputs level 
at december   we categorized approximately of our financial assets carried at fair value in level  in level and in level of the fair value hierarchy  including the effect of master netting agreements 
at december   we categorized approximately of our financial liabilities carried at fair value in level  in level and the remaining in level  including the effect of master netting agreements 

table of contents the investment securities categorized in level were substantially composed of us treasury securities  specifically treasury bills  which have a maturity of one year or less 
fair value was measured by management using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical securities 
the fair value of the investment securities categorized in level was measured by management primarily using information obtained from independent third parties 
information obtained from third parties is subject to review by management as part of a validation process 
management utilizes a process to review the information provided  including an understanding of underlying assumptions and the level of market participant information used to support those assumptions 
in addition  management compares significant assumptions used by third parties to available market information 
such information may include known trades or  to the extent that trading activity is limited in comparisons to market research information pertaining to credit expectations  execution prices and the timing of cash flows 
derivative instruments categorized in level predominantly represented foreign exchange and interest rate contracts used in our trading activities  for which fair value was measured by management using discounted cash flow techniques with inputs consisting of observable spot and forward points  as well as observable interest rate curves 
while the majority of our financial assets categorized in level were composed of asset backed and other debt securities available for sale  level also included certain foreign exchange derivatives 
the aggregate fair value of our financial assets and liabilities categorized in level as of december   compared to december   decreased approximately  primarily composed of transfers of asset backed securities  principally those collateralized by credit cards and student loans  and other debt securities to level  as fair value was measured using prices for which observable market information became available 
with respect to derivative instruments  we evaluated the impact on valuation of the credit risk of our counterparties and our own credit 
we considered factors such as the likelihood of default by us and our counterparties  our current and potential future net exposures and remaining maturities in determining the appropriate measurements of fair value 
valuation adjustments associated with these factors were not significant for  or interest revenue recognition and other than temporary impairment a significant portion of the assets carried in our consolidated balance sheet is our portfolio of fixed income investment securities 
as discussed below  the estimation of future cash flows from these securities is a significant factor in the recognition of both interest revenue and other than temporary impairment with respect to these securities 
expectations of defaults and prepayments are the most significant assumptions underlying our estimates of future cash flows 
in determining these estimates  management relies on relevant and reliable information  including but not limited to deal structure  including optional and mandatory calls  market interest rate curves  industry standard asset class specific prepayment models  recent prepayment history  independent credit ratings  and recent actual and projected credit losses 
management considers this information based on its relevance and uses its best judgment in order to determine its assumptions for underlying cash flow expectations and resulting estimates 
management reviews its underlying assumptions and develops expected future cash flow estimates at least quarterly 
additional detail with respect to the sensitivity of these default and prepayment assumptions is provided in the financial condition investment securities section of this management s discussion and analysis 
interest revenue recognition our investment portfolio  excluding the former conduit assets consolidated in  consists of securities which were not typically acquired at significant discounts or premiums to their face amounts 
in connection with the conduit consolidation  we recorded certain of the conduits investment securities at a significant discount to their face amount 
to the extent that future cash flows from these securities are expected to exceed their recorded carrying amounts  the portion of the discount not related to credit will be accreted into interest revenue in our 
table of contents consolidated statement of income over the securities remaining terms 
as a result of the magnitude of the discount  the estimates associated with the timing and amount of the accretion of these security discounts into interest revenue are significant to our consolidated financial statements 
a portion of the former conduit securities  primarily asset backed securities  had expected credit losses on the date of consolidation  or were considered to be certain beneficial interests in a securitization that were not of high credit quality  and therefore we account for these securities in accordance with specialized gaap 
as a result  interest revenue recognition for these securities differs from the accounting for the remainder of our portfolio 
the accounting for these securities requires an estimation of the timing and amount of each of the securities expected future principal  interest and other contractual cash flows  and the calculation of an effective yield based upon these estimates is used to record interest revenue 
generally  the timing and amount of these securities future cash flows are inherently uncertain  due to unknown timing and amount of principal payments including potential credit losses and the variability of future interest rates 
since the conduits were consolidated  we have recorded aggregate discount accretion in interest revenue in our consolidated statement of income of billion  composed of million in and million in we expect to record significantly less accretion in the future as a result of the repositioning of our investment portfolio completed during the fourth quarter of  as described under consolidated results of operations total revenue net interest revenue in this management s discussion and analysis 
other than temporary impairment gaap also requires the use of cash flow estimates to evaluate other than temporary impairment of our investment securities 
the amount and timing of expected future cash flows are significant estimates in the determination of other than temporary impairment 
additional information with respect to management s assessment of other than temporary impairment is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is created when the purchase price exceeds the assigned value of the net assets of acquired businesses  and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired 
other acquired identifiable intangible assets are recorded at their estimated fair value 
goodwill is not amortized 
other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives  and both goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to an impairment adjustment if events or circumstances indicate the potential inability to realize the carrying amount 
as required by gaap  we evaluate goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances dictate 
substantially all of the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition have resulted from business acquisitions of our investment servicing line of business  with the remainder associated with our investment management line of business 
the sustained value of the majority of goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from our investment servicing business 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth  or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods  could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill  which would be evaluated and  if necessary  be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment of the carrying amount 
we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our two major business lines 
the evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment using a two step process 
first  we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we compare the 
table of contents implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
to determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment  we use one of two principal methodologies a market approach  based on a comparison of the reporting unit to publicly traded companies in similar lines of business  or an income approach  based on the value of the cash flows that the business can be expected to generate in the future 
events that may indicate impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business  economic or political climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and a more likely than not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill or other intangible assets relate 
additional information about goodwill and other intangible assets  including information by line of business  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item our evaluation of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment in indicated that million of other intangible assets was impaired  which impairment was recorded in our consolidated statement of income 
no impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets was recorded in in  we recorded million of impairment of other intangible assets in our consolidated statement of income  million of which was recorded as a component of the million of restructuring charges 
goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at december  totaled approximately billion and billion  respectively  compared to billion and billion  respectively  at december  the increase in both amounts substantially resulted from our acquisitions of intesa and mifa

the amlf expired in february overview of consolidated statement of condition the structure of our consolidated statement of condition  or balance sheet  is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our core investment servicing and investment management businesses 
as our clients execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities  they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities 
these liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing transaction account deposits  which are denominated in a variety of currencies  and repurchase agreements  which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our clients 
our clients needs and our operating objectives determine the volume  mix and currency denomination of our consolidated balance sheet 
deposits and other liabilities generated by client activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities 
as a result  our assets consist primarily of securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity portfolios and short term money market 
table of contents instruments  such as interest bearing deposits and securities purchased under resale agreements 
as our non us business activities continue to grow  we have expanded our capabilities and processes to enable us to manage the liabilities generated by our core businesses and the related assets in which these liabilities are invested  in a manner that more closely aligns our businesses and related activities with the cash management  investment activities and other operations of our clients 
as a result  the structure of our balance sheet continues to evolve to reflect these efforts 
the actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the client liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets 
managing our consolidated balance sheet structure is conducted within specific board approved policies for interest rate risk  credit risk and liquidity 
additional information about our average balance sheet  primarily our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  is included in the consolidated results of operations total revenue net interest revenue section of this management s discussion and analysis

we consider a well diversified  high credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated balance sheet 
the portfolio is concentrated in securities with high credit quality  with approximately of the carrying value of the portfolio rated aaa or aa as of december  the percentages of the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio  by external credit rating  were as follows as of december aaa aa a bbb below bbb non rated includes us treasury securities 
the investment portfolio of approximately  securities is also diversified with respect to asset class 
approximately of the aggregate carrying value of the portfolio is composed of mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
the largely floating rate asset backed portfolio consists primarily of credit card and student loan backed securities 
mortgage backed securities are split between securities of federal national mortgage association  federal home loan mortgage corporation and us and us large issuer collateralized mortgage obligations 
approximately of the aggregate carrying amount of the portfolio is composed of non us debt securities 
the following table summarizes our aggregate non us debt securities  included in the preceding table of investment securities carrying values  by significant country of issuer or collateral  as of december in millions united kingdom australia netherlands cayman islands germany spain other total non us debt securities approximately of the aggregate carrying value of these securities was rated aaa and aa as of december  as of that date  the securities had an aggregate pre tax unrealized loss of approximately million and an average market to book ratio of 
the majority is floating rate securities  and accordingly the aggregate holdings have minimal interest rate risk 
the underlying collateral includes uk prime mortgages  netherlands mortgages and german automobiles  sectors which have an outstanding history of credit performance

impairment net unrealized losses on securities available for sale were as follows as of december in millions fair value amortized cost net unrealized loss  pre tax net unrealized loss  after tax the net unrealized loss amounts excluded the remaining net unrealized loss of million  or million after tax  and billion  or million after tax  respectively  as of december  and  
table of contents generally related to the reclassification of securities available for sale to securities held to maturity 
these after tax amounts were recorded in other comprehensive income 
the decline in the remaining after tax unrealized loss on transferred securities resulted primarily from amortization and from the recognition of losses from other than temporary impairment on certain of the securities 
we conduct periodic reviews of individual securities to assess whether other than temporary impairment exists 
to the extent that other than temporary impairment is identified  the impairment is broken into a credit component and a non credit component 
the credit component is recognized in our consolidated statement of income  and the non credit component is recognized in other comprehensive income to the extent that management does not intend to sell the security see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item 
our assessment of other than temporary impairment involves an evaluation  more fully described in note  of economic and security specific factors 
such factors are based on estimates  derived by management  which contemplate current market conditions and security specific performance 
to the extent that market conditions are worse than management s expectations  other than temporary impairment could increase  in particular the credit component that would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income 
given the exposure of our investment securities portfolio  particularly mortgage backed and asset backed securities  to residential mortgage and other consumer credit risks  the performance of the us housing market is a significant driver of the portfolio s credit performance 
as such  our assessment of other than temporary impairment relies to a significant extent on our estimates of trends in national housing prices 
generally  indices that measure trends in national housing prices are published in arrears 
as of december   national housing prices  according to the case shiller national home price index  had declined by approximately peak to current 
through september   there was a decline of approximately  resulting in a peak to current decline of approximately 
despite increased stabilization in housing prices  management s base assumption is that the year end information will indicate that peak to current housing prices will have declined by an additional to 
in particular  the performance of certain mortgage products and vintages continues to deteriorate 
in addition  management continues to believe that housing prices will decline further as indicated above 
the combination of these factors has led to an increase in management s overall loss expectations 
our investment portfolio continues to be sensitive to management s estimates of defaults and prepayment speeds 
ultimately  other than temporary impairment is based on specific cusip level detailed analysis of the unique characteristics of each security 
in addition  we perform sensitivity analysis across each significant product type within the non agency us residential mortgage backed portfolio 
for example  as it relates to our us non agency prime and alt a residential mortgage backed portfolios  if we were to increase default estimates to of management s current expectations with a corresponding slowdown of prepayment speeds to of management s current expectations  we estimate that other than temporary impairment on these securities related to credit would increase by approximately million to million 
this impairment would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income 
as it relates to our us sub prime asset backed portfolio  if we were to increase default estimates to of management s current expectations with a corresponding slowdown of prepayment speeds to of management s current expectations  we estimate that other than temporary impairment on these securities related to credit would increase by approximately million to million 
this impairment would be recorded in our consolidated statement of income 
the sensitivity estimates discussed above are based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the level of housing prices and the timing of defaults 
to the extent that such factors differ substantially from management s current expectations  resulting loss estimates may differ materially from those stated 
excluding the securities for which other than temporary impairment was recorded  management considers the aggregate decline in fair value of the remaining securities and the resulting net unrealized losses as of december  to be temporary and not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the securities 
additional information about our assessment of impairment is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item 
table of contents several major us financial institutions are participating in a mortgage foreclosure moratorium with respect to residential mortgages 
generally  we have no direct exposure to this moratorium  since we do not originate  purchase or service residential mortgage loans 
however  the rate at which existing residential mortgage foreclosure issues are resolved  as well as certain outcomes of the resolution of these issues  may affect  among other things  our investment securities portfolio 
such effects could include the timing of cash flows or the credit quality associated with the mortgages collateralizing certain of our residential mortgage backed securities  and  accordingly  could also affect the amount of other than temporary impairment that we recognize in future periods 
loans and leases us and us loans and leases  by segment  and aggregate average loans and leases  were as follows  as of and for the years ended december excluding the allowance for loan losses in millions institutional us non us commercial real estate us total loans and leases average loans and leases additional detail about these loan and lease segments  including underlying classes  is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item the institutional segment is composed of the following classes investment funds  commercial and financial  purchased receivables and lease financing

aggregate short duration advances to our clients included in the institutional segment were billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
commercial and financial includes lending to corporate borrowers  including broker dealers

the commercial real estate loans were acquired in pursuant to indemnified repurchase agreements with an affiliate of lehman as a result of the lehman brothers bankruptcy 
these loans  which are primarily collateralized by direct and indirect interests in commercial real estate  were recorded at their then current fair value  based on management s expectations with respect to future cash flows from the loans using appropriate market discount rates as of the date of acquisition 
certain of the loans are accounted for under the provisions of asc topic  loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality formerly aicpa statement of position no 
 accounting for certain loans or debt securities acquired in a transfer 
the provisions of asc topic require management to periodically estimate the loans expected future cash flows  and if the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected can be reasonably estimated  these cash flows are used to record interest revenue on the loans 
if the loans expected future cash flows increase  the increase is recorded over the remaining terms of the loans as an increase to the loans yields 
if expected future cash flows decrease  an allowance for loan losses is established and the accretable yields on the loans are maintained 
in accordance with asc topic and our accounting policy with respect to non accrual loans  we would place these acquired commercial real estate loans on non accrual status in the future if and when we were unable to reasonably estimate their expected future cash flows 

table of contents during  in connection with the modification of one of the commercial real estate loans acquired in  we executed a million revolver facility with the borrower  under which million was outstanding as of december   resulting in an aggregate loan to the borrower of million as of december  the facility has a remaining term of seven years  with two one year extension options 
the original loan is classified as a troubled debt restructuring 
in addition  during  as a result of a settlement related to the indemnified repurchase agreements  we acquired an additional commercial real estate loan and recorded it at its then current fair value of million 
prior to its acquisition  this loan had been performing in accordance with its contractual terms and had no evidence of credit deterioration as of the acquisition date  and accordingly is not accounted for under the above described provisions of asc topic as of december   we held an aggregate of approximately million of commercial real estate loans which were modified in troubled debt restructurings 
no impairment loss was recognized upon restructuring the loans  as the discounted cash flows of the modified loans exceeded the carrying amount of the original loans as of the modification date 
there were no troubled debt restructurings outstanding as of december    or we define past due loans as loans on which principal or interest payments are over days delinquent  but for which interest continues to be accrued 
there were no institutional loans days or more contractually past due as of december     or although a portion of the commercial real estate loans is days or more contractually past due  we do not report them as past due loans  because in accordance with gaap  the interest earned on these loans is based on an accretable yield resulting from management s expectations with respect to the future cash flows for each loan relative to both the timing and collection of principal and interest as of the reporting date  not the loans contractual payment terms 
these cash flow estimates are updated quarterly to reflect changes in management s expectations  which consider market conditions 
we generally place loans on non accrual status once principal or interest payments are days past due  or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable 
loans days past due  but considered both well secured and in the process of collection  may be excluded from non accrual status 
for loans placed on non accrual status  revenue recognition is suspended 
as of december  and  approximately million and million  respectively  of the aforementioned commercial real estate loans had been placed by management on non accrual status  as the yield associated with these loans  determined when the loans were acquired  was deemed to be non accretable 
this determination was based on management s expectations of the future collection of principal and interest from the loans 
future changes in expectations with respect to collection of principal and interest on these loans could result in additional non accrual loans and provisions for loan losses 
there were no non accrual loans as of december   or

the commercial real estate loans are reviewed on a quarterly basis  and any provisions for loan losses that are recorded reflect management s current expectations with respect to future cash flows from these loans  based on an assessment of economic conditions in the commercial real estate market and other factors 

table of contents cross border outstandings cross border outstandings  as defined by bank regulatory rules  are amounts payable to state street by residents of foreign countries  regardless of the currency in which the claim is denominated  and local country claims in excess of local country obligations 
these cross border outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks  loans and lease financing and investment securities 
as our non us business activities have grown  our cross border outstandings have increased  as we have invested in more non us assets 
in addition to credit risk  cross border outstandings have the risk that  as a result of political or economic conditions in a country  borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of  or restrictions on  foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations

capital the management of regulatory and economic capital both involve key metrics evaluated by management to assess whether our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile  is in compliance with all regulatory requirements  and is sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives 
regulatory capital our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs  including funding corporate growth and supporting clients cash management needs  and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors 
we strive to maintain an optimal level of capital  commensurate with our risk profile  on which an attractive return to shareholders is expected to be realized over both the short and long term  while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and satisfying regulatory capital adequacy requirements 
our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures  our regulatory capital requirements  the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt and our capital position relative to our peers 
our asset  liability and capital committee  referred to as alcco  oversees the management of our regulatory capital  and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements  internal targets and the expectations of the major independent credit rating agencies 
the primary regulator of both state street and state street bank for regulatory capital purposes is the federal reserve 
both state street and state street bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the federal reserve and defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act 
table of contents of state street bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for the parent company to maintain its status as a financial holding company 
regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for state street and state street bank were as follows as of december regulatory guidelines state street state street bank minimum well capitalized regulatory capital ratios tier risk based capital total risk based capital tier leverage ratio regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to state street bank 
at december   state street s and state street bank s tier and total risk based capital ratios increased compared to year end the increases for state street and state street bank resulted primarily from the impact of the investment portfolio repositioning completed in december  which significantly reduced on balance sheet risk weighted assets 
the decreases in the tier leverage ratios for both entities were generally due to increases in adjusted quarterly average assets associated with overall balance sheet growth 
at december   regulatory capital ratios for state street and state street bank exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds 
in february  we issued an aggregate of approximately million of junior subordinated debentures due march   in a remarketing of the junior subordinated debentures due originally issued to state street capital trust iii in in connection with our offering of the trust s fixed to floating rate normal automatic preferred enhanced capital securities  or normal apex see note to the consolidated financial statements included under item 
the net proceeds from the sale of the remarketed junior subordinated debentures were used to purchase us treasury securities maturing in march  and the proceeds from the maturity of these securities will be used in march by capital trust iii to make a final distribution to the holders of the normal apex with respect to the original junior subordinated debentures and to satisfy the obligation of capital trust iii to purchase shares of our non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series a   liquidation preference per share  whereby the principal asset of capital trust iii will be the shares of our preferred stock 
as a result of the above described transactions  we will have outstanding the above referenced million of junior subordinated debentures due march  and million of non cumulative perpetual preferred stock 
the perpetual preferred stock will qualify as tier regulatory capital  and the junior subordinated debentures will qualify as tier regulatory capital  under federal regulatory capital guidelines 
common stock no shares of our common stock were purchased during or under existing board authorization 
as of december   approximately million shares remained available for future purchase under the board authorization 
we cannot currently purchase shares of our common stock without federal reserve approval 
in january  under an existing authorization by our board of directors  we purchased  shares of our common stock  at an average historical cost per share of approximately  in connection with a billion accelerated share repurchase program that concluded in january we generally employ third party broker dealers to acquire shares on the open market in connection with our common stock purchase program 
funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources 
the level of dividends to shareholders on our common stock  which totaled million per 
table of contents share in both and compared to million  or per share  in  is reviewed regularly and determined by the board of directors considering our liquidity  capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects  as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant 
during the first quarter of  in light of the continued disruption in the global capital markets experienced since the middle of  and as part of a plan to strengthen our tangible common equity  we announced a reduction of our quarterly dividend on our common stock to per share 
currently  any increase in our common stock dividend requires the prior approval of the federal reserve 
federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company 
in addition  banking regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends 
information concerning limitations on dividends from our subsidiary banks is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item other the current minimum regulatory capital requirements enforced by the us banking regulators are based on a international accord  commonly referred to as basel i  which was developed by the basel committee on banking supervision 
in  the basel committee released the final version of its new capital adequacy framework  referred to as basel ii 
basel ii governs the capital adequacy of large  internationally active banking organizations  such as state street  that generally rely on sophisticated risk management and measurement systems  and requires these organizations to enhance their measurement and management of the risks underlying their business activities and to better align regulatory capital requirements with those risks 
basel ii adopts a three pillar framework for addressing capital adequacy minimum capital requirements  which incorporate the measurement of credit risk  market risk and operational risk  supervisory review  which addresses the need for a banking organization to assess its capital adequacy position relative to its overall risk  rather than only with respect to its minimum capital requirement  and market discipline  which imposes public disclosure requirements on a banking organization intended to allow the assessment of key information about the organization s risk profile and its associated level of regulatory capital 
in december  us banking regulators jointly issued final rules to implement the basel ii framework in the us the framework does not supersede or change the existing prompt corrective action and leverage capital requirements applicable to banking organizations in the us  and explicitly reserves the regulators authority to require organizations to hold additional capital where appropriate 
prior to full implementation of the basel ii framework  state street is required to complete a defined qualification period  during which it must demonstrate that it complies with the related regulatory requirements to the satisfaction of the federal reserve  state street s and state street bank s primary us banking regulator 
state street is currently in the qualification period for basel ii 
in addition  in response to the recent financial crisis and ongoing global financial market dynamics  the basel committee has proposed new guidelines  referred to as basel iii 
basel iii would establish more stringent capital and liquidity requirements  including higher minimum regulatory capital ratios  new capital buffers  higher risk weighted asset calibrations  more restrictive definitions of qualifying capital  a liquidity coverage ratio and a net stable funding ratio 
these requirements  as well as related provisions of the dodd frank act and other international regulatory initiatives  could have a material impact on our businesses and our profitability 
us banking regulators will be required to enact new rules specific to the us banking industry to implement the final basel iii accord 
consequently  it is not possible to determine with certainty at this time how our regulatory capital and our operations will align with the regulatory capital requirements of basel iii  or when we will be expected to be compliant with the basel regulatory capital requirements 
we believe that we will be able to comply with the relevant basel ii and basel iii regulatory capital requirements when and as applied to us 

table of contents economic capital we define economic capital as the capital required to protect holders of our senior debt  and obligations higher in priority  against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target aa senior debt rating 
economic capital requirements are one of several important measures used by management and the board of directors to assess the adequacy of our capital levels in relation to state street s risk profile 
alcco is responsible for overseeing our economic capital process 
the framework and methodologies used to quantify economic capital for each of the risk types described below have been developed by our enterprise risk management  global treasury and corporate finance groups and are designed to be generally consistent with our risk management principles and basel ii 
this economic capital framework has been approved by senior management 
due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques  we expect to periodically refine the methodologies  assumptions  and data used to estimate our economic capital requirements  which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our business activities 
we quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories market risk the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices  primarily as they relate to our trading activities  interest rate risk the risk of loss in non trading asset and liability management positions  primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between our balance sheet assets and liabilities  credit risk the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty  operational risk the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events  which is consistent with the basel ii definition  and business risk the risk of negative earnings resulting from adverse changes in business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of our business activities  and the effect of strategic and reputation risks 
economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and  in some cases  external data 
these individual results are then aggregated at the state street consolidated level 
a capital reduction  or diversification benefit  is then applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss in each risk type at the same time 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner  and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise 
effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our clients and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions 
significant uses of liquidity  described more fully below  consist primarily of funding deposit withdrawals and outstanding commitments to extend credit or commitments to purchase securities as they are drawn upon 
liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and by our consolidated balance sheet asset structure 
our global treasury group is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position  which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by alcco 
management maintains a liquidity measurement framework to assess the sources and uses of liquidity that is monitored by global treasury and our enterprise risk management group 
embedded in this framework is a process that outlines several levels of potential risk to our liquidity and identifies triggers that we use as early warning signals of a possible difficulty 
these triggers are a combination of internal and external measures of potential increases in cash needs or decreases in available sources of cash and possible impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets 
another important component of the framework is a contingency funding plan that is designed to identify and manage through a potential liquidity crisis 
the plan defines roles  responsibilities and management 
table of contents actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a state street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets 
specific actions are linked to the levels of triggers 
we generally manage our liquidity risk on a global basis at the state street consolidated level 
we also manage parent company liquidity  and in certain cases branch liquidity  separately 
state street bank generally has broader access to funding products and markets limited to banks  specifically the federal funds market and the federal reserve s discount window 
the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile  reflecting narrower market access 
we typically hold enough cash  primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with subsidiary banks  to meet current debt maturities and cash needs  as well as those projected over the next one year period 
sources of liquidity come from two primary areas access to the global capital markets and liquid assets carried on our consolidated balance sheet 
our ability to source incremental funding at reasonable rates of interest from wholesale investors in the capital markets is the first source of liquidity we would access to accommodate the uses of liquidity described below 
on balance sheet liquid assets are also an integral component of our liquidity management strategy 
these assets provide liquidity through maturities of the assets  but more importantly  they provide us with the ability to raise funds by pledging the securities as collateral for borrowings or through outright sales 
each of these sources of liquidity is used in our management of daily cash needs and is available in a crisis scenario should we need to accommodate potential large  unexpected demand for funds 
uses of liquidity generally result from the following withdrawals of unsecured client deposits  draw downs on unfunded commitments to extend credit or to purchase securities  generally provided through lines of credit  and short duration advance facilities 
client deposits are generated largely from our investment servicing activities  and are invested in a combination of term investment securities and short term money market assets whose mix is determined by the characteristics of the deposits 
most of the client deposits are payable on demand or are short term in nature  which means that withdrawals can potentially occur quickly and in large amounts 
similarly  clients can request disbursement of funds under commitments to extend credit  or can overdraw their deposit accounts rapidly and in large volumes 
in addition  a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements  such as large draw downs of existing lines of credit  could require additional liquidity 
material risks to sources of short term liquidity could include  among other things  adverse changes in the perception in the financial markets of our financial condition or liquidity needs  and downgrades by major independent credit rating agencies of our deposits and our debt securities  which would restrict our ability to access the capital markets and could lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our clients 
in managing our liquidity  we have issued term wholesale certificates of deposit  or cds  and invested those funds in short term money market assets which are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet and would be available to meet cash needs 
at december   this wholesale cd portfolio totaled billion  compared to billion at december  in connection with our management of liquidity where we seek to maintain access to sources of back up liquidity at reasonable costs  we have participated in the federal reserve s secured lending program available to financial institutions  referred to as the term auction facility  or taf 
state street bank terminated its participation in the taf in february  and consequently had no taf balance outstanding at december   compared to billion at december  since then  the federal reserve has terminated the taf program 
the highest taf balance outstanding during the year ended december  for state street bank was billion  compared to billion during the year ended december  the average taf balance outstanding for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to an average taf balance of approximately billion for the year ended december  in addition to these funding sources  at december   asset backed commercial paper issued to third parties by the conduits  which were consolidated into our financial statements in may  totaled approximately billion  compared to billion at december  we continue to market the conduit commercial paper program to investors in order to fund the remaining former conduit assets 

table of contents while maintenance of our high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program  on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control  and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as collateral 
our liquid assets consist primarily of cash balances at central banks in excess of regulatory requirements and other short term liquid assets  such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks  the latter of which are multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks  and high quality  marketable investment securities not already pledged  which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to generate cash quickly 
at december   the value of our liquid assets  as defined  totaled billion  compared to billion at december  due to the unusual size and volatile nature of our quarter end client deposits  we maintained approximately billion at central banks as of december   compared to as of december   both in excess of regulatory required minimums 
aggregate investment securities carried at billion as of december   compared to billion as of december   were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits  borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law  and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation  unless pledged internally between state street affiliates 
liquid assets included securities pledged to the federal reserve bank of boston to secure state street bank s ability to borrow from their discount window should the need arise 
this access to primary credit is an important source of back up liquidity for state street bank 
as of december   state street bank had no outstanding primary credit borrowings from the discount window 
based on our level of liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary  including our ability to issue debt and equity securities under our current universal shelf registration  management considers overall liquidity at december  to be sufficient to meet state street s current commitments and business needs  including supporting the liquidity of the commercial paper conduits and accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of our clients 
as referenced above  our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt  as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies 
factors essential to maintaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings  strong risk management  strong capital ratios  diverse liquidity sources  including the global capital markets and client deposits  and strong liquidity monitoring procedures 
high ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by increasing the potential market for our debt 
a downgrade or reduction of these credit ratings could have an adverse effect to our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates

additional information about commitments is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item risk management the global scope of our business activities requires that we balance what we perceive to be the primary risks in our businesses with a comprehensive and well integrated risk management function 
the identification  measurement  monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of our businesses 
these risks  if not effectively managed  can result in current losses to state street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation 
our systematic approach allows for a more precise assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital that appropriately balance risk and return 
we have a disciplined approach to risk management that involves all levels of management 
the board  through its risk and capital committee  provides extensive review and oversight of our overall risk management programs  including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of state street s risk appetite statement  which is an integral part of our overall internal capital adequacy assessment process  or icaap 
the risk appetite statement outlines the quantitative limits and qualitative goals that define and constrain our risk appetite and defines responsibilities for measuring and monitoring risk against limits  which are reported regularly to the board 
in addition  state street utilizes a variety of key risk indicators to monitor risk on a more granular level 
risk management  a corporate function  provides oversight  support and coordination across business units independent of the business units activities  and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines 
in addition  risk management establishes and reviews approved limits and  in collaboration with business line management  monitors key risks 
our chief risk officer meets regularly with the board and its risk and capital committee  and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary 
the execution of duties with respect to the management of people  products  business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers 
the function of risk management is designing and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards  and providing oversight of the business owned risks 
accordingly  risk management is a shared responsibility between the risk management function and the business lines  and requires joint efforts in goal setting  program design and implementation  resource management  and performance evaluation between business and functional units 
responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees  as well as the board s risk and capital committee 
the management risk and capital committee  or mrac  co chaired by 
table of contents our chief risk officer and chief financial officer  is the senior management decision making body for risk and capital issues  and is responsible for ensuring that state street s strategy  budget  risk appetite and capital adequacy are properly aligned 
alcco  chaired by our treasurer  oversees the management of our consolidated balance sheet  the management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions  our regulatory and economic capital  the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure  and debt and equity issuances 
state street s risk management program is supported by the activities of a number of corporate risk oversight committees  all of which are chaired by senior executives within risk management 
our fiduciary review committee reviews the criteria for the acceptance of fiduciary duties  and assists our business lines with their fiduciary responsibilities executed on behalf of clients 
our credit committee acts as the credit and counterparty risk guidelines committee for state street 
our operational risk committee provides cross business oversight of operational risk to identify  measure  manage and control operational risk in an effective and consistent manner across state street 
our model assessment committee provides recommendations concerning technical modeling issues and independently validates financial models utilized by our business units 
while we believe that our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses  external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated 
market risk market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and other market driven factors and prices 
state street is exposed to market risk in both its trading and non trading  or asset and liability management  activities 
the market risk management processes related to these activities  discussed in further detail below  apply to both on and off balance sheet exposures 
we engage in trading and investment activities primarily to serve our clients needs and to contribute to our overall corporate earnings and liquidity 
in the conduct of these activities  we are subject to  and assume  market risk 
the level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall risk appetite  objectives and liquidity needs  our clients requirements and market volatility 
interest rate risk  a component of market risk  is more thoroughly discussed in the asset and liability management portion of this market risk section 
trading activities market risk associated with foreign exchange and other trading activities is managed through corporate guidelines  including established limits on aggregate and net open positions  sensitivity to changes in interest rates  and concentrations  which are supplemented by stop loss thresholds 
we use a variety of risk management tools and methodologies  including value at risk  or var  described later in this section  to measure  monitor and manage market risk 
all limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers  the market risk management group and the trading and market risk committee 
we use a variety of derivative financial instruments to support our clients needs  conduct trading activities and manage our interest rate and currency risk 
these activities are designed to generate trading revenue and to hedge potential earnings volatility 
in addition  we provide services related to derivatives in our role as both a manager and a servicer of financial assets 
our clients use derivatives to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities 
with the growth of cross border investing  our clients have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investments and to manage the currency risk in their international investment portfolios 
as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets  we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these client needs 
as part of our trading activities  we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivatives  including foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps  and interest rate futures 
as of december   the aggregate notional amount of these derivatives was billion  of which billion was composed of foreign exchange forward  swap and spot contracts 
in the aggregate  positions are matched closely to 
table of contents minimize currency and interest rate risk 
all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates 
additional information about trading derivatives is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item as noted above  we use a variety of risk measurement tools and methodologies  including var  which is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval 
we use a risk measurement system to estimate var daily 
we have adopted standards for estimating var  and we maintain capital for market risk in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines 
var is estimated for a one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of two years 
a one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated var more than of the time  or less than three business days out of a year 
the methodology uses a simulation approach based on historically observed changes in foreign exchange rates  us and us interest rates and foreign exchange implied volatilities  and incorporates the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions 
like all quantitative risk measures  our var methodology is subject to inherent limitations and assumptions 
our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed 
the estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of trading positions held at the end of each business day 
therefore  implicit in the var estimate is the assumption that no intra day actions are taken by management during adverse market movements 
as a result  the methodology does not incorporate risk associated with intra day changes in positions or intra day price volatility 
the following table presents var with respect to our trading activities  for trading positions held during the periods indicated  as measured by our var methodology 
the generally lower total var amounts compared to component var amounts primarily relate to diversification benefits across risk types 
value at risk year ended december  in millions annual average maximum minimum annual average maximum minimum foreign exchange rates interest rates total var for trading assets we back test the estimated one day var on a daily basis 
this information is reviewed and used to confirm that all relevant trading positions are properly modeled 
during the years ended december  and  we did not experience any actual trading losses in excess of our end of day var estimate 
our var methodology also measures var associated with certain assets classified as trading account assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
these assets are not held in connection with typical trading activities  and thus are not reflected in the foregoing var table 
in the table below  the var associated with these assets is reported as var for non trading assets 
total regulatory var is calculated as the sum of the var for trading assets and the var for non trading assets  with no diversification benefits recognized 
the average  maximum and minimum amounts are calculated for each line item separately 
total regulatory value at risk years ended december  in millions annual average maximum minimum annual average maximum minimum var for trading assets var for non trading assets total regulatory var 
table of contents asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue  or nir  under varying economic environments  while protecting the economic values of our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
most of our nir is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our investment servicing and investment management lines of business 
we structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities  but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines 
our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board and guidelines established and monitored by alcco 
our global treasury group has responsibility for managing state street s day to day interest rate risk 
to effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related nir  global treasury has the authority to assume a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons 
global treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis organized into three regional treasury units  north america  europe and asia pacific  to reflect the growing  global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position 
our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk 
we invest in financial instruments with currency  repricing  and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position 
in addition to on balance sheet assets  we use certain derivative instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  to alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities 
the use of derivatives is subject to alcco approved guidelines 
additional information about our use of derivatives is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item as a result of growth in our non us operations  including the intesa and mifa acquisitions  non us dollar denominated client liabilities are a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet 
this growth results in exposure to changes in the shape and level of non us dollar yield curves  which we include in our consolidated interest rate risk management process 
because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our exposures to changes in interest rates  we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on nir and balance sheet values 
net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible nir results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments 
we also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates 
to measure  monitor  and report on our interest rate risk position  we use nir simulation  or nir at risk  which measures the impact on nir over the next twelve months to immediate  or rate shock  and gradual  or rate ramp  changes in market interest rates  and economic value of equity  or eve  which measures the impact on the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates 
nir at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on nir in the short term 
eve  on the other hand  is a long term view of interest rate risk  but with a view toward liquidation of state street 
both of these measures are subject to alcco approved guidelines  and are monitored regularly  along with other relevant simulations  scenario analyses and stress tests  by both global treasury and alcco 
in calculating our nir at risk  we start with a base amount of nir that is projected over the next twelve months  assuming our forecasted yield curve over the period 
our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months 
that yield curve is then shocked  or moved immediately  basis points in a parallel fashion  or at all points along the yield curve 
two new twelve month nir projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions  but with the new yield curves  and compared to the base scenario 
we also perform 
table of contents the calculations using interest rate ramps  which are basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve months  rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks 
eve is based on the change in the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest 
the present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case 
we then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values 
a large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from borrowers prepayment opportunities 
key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows  the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities  especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities  changes in market conditions  and interest rate sensitivities of our client liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the models cannot precisely predict future nir or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on nir and economic value 
actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions  changes in spreads and management strategies  among other factors 
projections of potential future streams of nir are assessed as part of our forecasting process 
the following table presents the estimated exposure of nir for the next twelve months  calculated as of december  and december   due to an immediate basis point shift in then current interest rates 
estimated incremental exposures presented below are dependent on management s assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios  such as those previously discussed  and do not reflect any additional actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on state street s financial performance 
nir at risk estimated exposure to net interest revenue in millions december  december  rate change bps shock bps shock bps ramp bps ramp as of december   for an upward basis point shock in market rates versus nir sensitivity at december   nir improved due to forecasted investment portfolio re investment  which would occur at higher rates  after the shock  coupled with the current assumptions for client deposit pricing sensitivities 
for an upward basis point ramp in market rates  the same factors affect this analysis  however  the benefit is depressed as rates increase more slowly 
for a downward basis point shock in market rates  forecasted portfolio re investment would compress asset yields with little relief on deposit expense due to the historically low level of interest rates  however  the increase in portfolio duration in provides some benefit to nir sensitivity as of december  compared to december  for a downward basis point ramp in market rates  the same factors described above affect nir at risk  but to a lesser extent as decreases in interest rates occur more slowly 
other important factors which affect the levels of nir are balance sheet size and mix  interest rate spreads  the slope and interest rate level of us dollar and us dollar yield curves and the relationship between them  the pace of change in market interest rates  and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions 
the following table presents estimated eve exposures  calculated as of december  and december   assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates  the impact of which would be spread over a number of years 

table of contents economic value of equity estimated exposure to economic value of equity in millions december  december  rate change bps shock bps shock the increase in the exposure to eve for an upward basis point shock as of december  compared to december  is attributable to the re investment of investment portfolio amortization and other run off into fixed rate us government securities 
these same factors account for the improvement in the exposure to eve for a downward basis point shock as of december  compared to december  credit risk credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle a transaction in accordance with contractual terms 
we assume credit and counterparty risk for both our on and off balance sheet exposures 
the extension of credit and the acceptance of counterparty risk by state street are governed by corporate guidelines based on each counterparty s risk profile  the markets served  counterparty and country concentrations  and regulatory compliance 
our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk for a variety of products and durations 
we maintain comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake 
an internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss 
state street s risk rating process incorporates the use of risk rating tools in conjunction with management judgment 
qualitative and quantitative inputs are captured in a transparent and replicable manner  and following a formal review and approval process  an internal credit rating based on state street s credit scale is assigned 
counterparties are evaluated on an individual basis at least annually  while significant exposures to counterparties are reviewed daily 
processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for all credit extensions 
as part of the approval and renewal process  due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure  as well as the creditworthiness of the counterparty 
at any point in time  having one or more counterparties to which our exposure exceeds of our consolidated total shareholders equity  exclusive of unrealized gains or losses  is not unusual 
exposure to these counterparties is regularly evaluated by risk management 
we provide  on a limited basis  traditional loan products and services to key clients in a manner that is intended to enhance client relationships  increase profitability and manage risk 
we employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based upon credit quality and the overall institutional relationship 
an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio that can be estimated  and is reviewed regularly by management for adequacy 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to current earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate relative to the level of estimated probable credit losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
information about provisions for loan losses is included in the provision for loan losses section of this management s discussion and analysis 
we purchase securities under agreements to resell  referred to as repurchase agreements 
most repurchase agreements are short term  with maturities of less than days 
risk is managed through a variety of processes  including establishing the acceptability of counterparties  limiting purchases largely to low risk us government securities  taking possession or control of pledged assets  monitoring levels of underlying collateral  and limiting the duration of the agreements 
securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is required from the borrower 
we also provide clients with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters and lines of credit and standby bond purchase agreements 
these exposures are subject to an initial credit 
table of contents analysis  with detailed approval and review processes 
these facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed annually 
we maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities  which is recorded in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated statement of condition 
management reviews the adequacy of this reserve on a regular basis 
on behalf of clients enrolled in our lending program  we lend securities to banks  broker dealers and other institutions 
in most circumstances  we indemnify our clients for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities 
though these transactions are collateralized  the substantial volume of these activities necessitates detailed credit based underwriting and monitoring processes 
the aggregate amount of indemnified securities on loan totaled billion at december   and billion at december  we require the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the fair market value of the securities borrowed 
state street holds the collateral received in connection with its securities lending services as agent  and these holdings are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition 
the securities on loan and the collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary 
we held  as agent  cash and securities totaling billion and billion as collateral for indemnified securities on loan at december  and december   respectively 
the collateral held by us is invested on behalf of our clients 
in certain cases  the collateral is invested in third party repurchase agreements  for which we indemnify the client against loss of the principal invested 
we require the repurchase agreement counterparty to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the amount of the repurchase agreement 
the indemnified repurchase agreements and the related collateral are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition 
of the collateral of billion at december  and billion at december  referenced above  billion at december  and billion at december  was invested in indemnified repurchase agreements 
we held  as agent  billion and billion as collateral for indemnified investments in repurchase agreements at december  and december   respectively 
investments in debt and equity securities  including investments in affiliates  are monitored regularly by corporate finance and risk management 
procedures are in place for assessing impaired securities  as discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements included under item operational risk we define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events 
as a leading provider of services to institutional investors  we provide a broad array of services  including research  investment management  trading services and investment servicing  that give rise to operational risk 
consequently  active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business 
our operational risk policy statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for its management 
the policy statement is reinforced by the operational risk guidelines  which document our practices and provide a mandate within which programs  processes  and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified  measured  managed and controlled in a consistent manner across state street 
responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at state street 
we maintain a governance structure related to operational risk designed to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management 
the risk and capital committee of the board sets operational risk policy and oversees implementation of the operational risk framework 
risk management develops corporate programs to manage operational risk and oversees the overall operational risk program 
business units take responsibility for their own operational risk and periodically review the status of the business controls  which are designed to provide a sound operational environment 
the business units also identify  manage  and report on operational risk 
the operational risk committee reviews operational risk related information and policies  provides oversight of the operational risk program  and escalates operational risk issues of note to the mrac and risk and capital committee of the board 
corporate audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the examining audit committee of the board 

table of contents our discipline in managing operational risk  which is a result of this emphasis on policy  guidelines  oversight  and independent review  provides the structure to identify  evaluate  control  monitor  measure  mitigate and report operational risk 
business risk we define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks  not already captured as market  interest rate  credit or operational risks 
we incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs 
active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business  and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at state street 
separating the effects of a potential material adverse event into operational and business risk is sometimes difficult 
for instance  the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss  while the impact on our reputation and the potential loss of clients and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss 
an additional example of business risk is the integration of a major acquisition 
failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business  and the resultant inability to retain clients  would be classified as a business risk loss 
business risk is managed with a long term focus 
techniques for its assessment and management include the development of business plans and appropriate management oversight 
the potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision 
we use a combination of historical earnings volatility  scenario analysis  stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on state street attributable to business risk 
management and control of business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall strategic planning and internal risk management processes 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of our business  we utilize three types of special purpose entities 
one type is utilized in connection with our involvement as collateral manager with respect to managed investment vehicles 
since we have determined that we are not the primary beneficiary of these managed investment vehicles as defined by gaap  we do not record them in our consolidated financial statements 
a second type is utilized in connection with our asset backed commercial paper program  under which conduits administered by us sell commercial paper to our institutional clients  primarily mutual fund clients  as short term investments 
we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of these conduits as defined by gaap  and they are recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
a third type is utilized in connection with our tax exempt investment program  under which trusts structure and sell certificated interests in pools of tax exempt investment grade assets  principally to our mutual fund clients 
the activities associated with these vehicles are recorded in our consolidated financial statements  since we treat the underlying transactions as secured borrowings  not as sales  for accounting purposes 
additional information about the activities of the above described special purpose entities is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item in the normal course of our business  we hold assets under custody and administration and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for our clients  and  in accordance with gaap  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
similarly  collateral funds associated with our securities finance activities are held by us as agent  therefore  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
additional information about these off balance sheet activities is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements included under item in the normal course of our business  we utilize derivative financial instruments to support our clients needs  to conduct our trading activities and to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk
