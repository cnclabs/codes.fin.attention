the company has million  at par  invested in ars which were classified as long term investments in our financial statements as of march  our ars investments are not mortgage backed based but are municipal based and the securities underlying the ars are currently rated aaa  the highest rating available by a rating agency

in fiscal  the fair value of investments was based upon a valuation assessment by an outside third party  conducted in april the company recorded an unrealized impairment loss of  in fiscal  within accumulated other comprehensive loss  based upon an assessment of the fair value of these ars 
the  impairment was recorded as temporary due to the fact that the company has both the ability and intent to hold these securities until anticipated recovery or maturity 
however  it could take until the final maturity or issuer refinancing of the underlying debt for us to realize the recorded value of our investments in these securities 
if the issuers of our ars are unable to successfully close future auctions or redeem or refinance the securities and their credit ratings deteriorate  we may in the future be required to record an additional impairment charge on these investments  or may need to sell these securities on a secondary market 
although we believe we will be able to liquidate our investments in these securities without any significant loss  the timing and financial impact of such an outcome is uncertain 
based on our expected cash expenditures  our cash and cash equivalents balance  and other potential sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the potential lack of liquidity of these investments in the near term will adversely affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
as of both march  and the company had no outstanding lease commitments except for the lease for its  square foot facility 
we are not currently bound by any long or short term agreements for the purchase or lease of capital expenditures 
any amounts expended for capital expenditures would be the result of an increase in the capacity needed to adequately provide for any increase in our business 
to date we have paid for any needed additions to our capital equipment infrastructure from working capital funds and anticipate this being the case in the future 
presently  we have approximately  forecasted for capital expenditures in fiscal which will be funded through cash from operations 
the company s primary source of working capital is cash from operations

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk that losses may occur in the value of financial instruments as a result of movements in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices 
our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments  accounts receivable  and accounts payable

our investments are subject to market risk  primarily interest rate and credit risk 
our investments are managed by a limited number of outside professional managers within investment guidelines set by our board of directors 
such guidelines include security type  credit quality  and maturity  and are intended to limit market risk by restricting our investments to high quality debt instruments with both short and long term maturities
