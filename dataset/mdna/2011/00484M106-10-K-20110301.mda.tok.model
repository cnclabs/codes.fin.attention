item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
background since we commenced operations in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the identification  development and commercialization of novel therapies that improve neurological function in people with ms and other neurological disorders 
ampyra  the first product for which we completed clinical development  was approved by the fda in january for the improvement of walking in people with ms 
this was demonstrated by an increase in walking speed 
to our knowledge  ampyra is the first and only product approved for this indication 
efficacy was shown in people with all four major types of ms relapsing remitting  secondary progressive  progressive relapsing and primary progressive 
ampyra was made commercially available in the us in march net revenue of ampyra was million for the year ended december  our other marketed drug  zanaflex capsules  which we began marketing in  is fda approved as a short acting drug for the management of spasticity 
combined net revenue of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets  which we also sell  were and million in the years ended december  and respectively 
we expect that our gross sales of zanaflex capsules will continue to decline  principally due to increasing managed care pressure  among other factors 
managed care organizations have increasingly established plans and programs to drive utilization of low cost generic tizanidine hydrochloride tablets over higher cost zanaflex capsules by making it more difficult for patients to obtain zanaflex capsules through restrictions and higher out of pocket copay costs 
there was a price increase on zanaflex capsules effective february  and a price increase on zanaflex capsules and tablets effective november  
table of contents ampyra is being marketed in the us through our own specialty sales force and commercial infrastructure  which is also responsible for sales and marketing of zanaflex capsules 
we completed the expansion of our sales force in march and currently have approximately sales representatives in the field calling on a priority target list of approximately  physicians 
we also have established teams of regional scientific managers and managed markets representatives who provide information on ampyra to physicians and payors 
as of december   approximately  healthcare professionals had written at least one prescription for ampyra 
ampyra is available only through a network of specialty pharmacy providers that provide the medication to patients by mail and kaiser permanente kaiser  and is supported by ampyra patient support services apss  a dedicated resource for healthcare providers and people with ms 
this distribution process is well established within the ms community  and physicians and patients are familiar with this model 
prior to the launch of ampyra  we contracted with a third party organization with extensive experience in coordinating patient benefits to run apss 
the customer care agents at ampyra patient support services are responsible for helping healthcare professionals process prescriptions  working with insurance carriers to facilitate coverage  and directing patients to available copay and patient assistance programs 
the process begins when a prescription is submitted by a physician to apss 
once this process is completed  the prescription is sent to a specialty pharmacy  which confirms the benefits and mails the prescription directly to the patient 
in some cases  the specialty pharmacy rather than apss performs the benefits investigation or receives a submitted prescription directly 
a prescription request backlog was experienced at apss early in the launch due to pent up demand  and we worked to have apss implement process improvements and staffing adjustments to address the backlog 
the backlog continued to be filled during the quarter ended june   and it was eliminated by the end of that quarter 
third quarter sales were significantly impacted by the large backlog of prescription requests that were submitted earlier in the year and were not all filled until the third quarter 
this backlog was eliminated in the third quarter 
processing of most incoming requests for prescriptions by apss now begins within hours of receipt 
patients will still experience a range of times to receive their first shipment based on their insurance requirements 
as with any new prescription product  patients who are members of benefit plans that have restrictive prior authorizations may experience delays in receiving their prescription 
as of december   approximately  people with ms had filled a prescription for ampyra  representing approximately of all ms patients in the us as of december   the rate of first refill was approximately 
approximately to of total prescriptions written through december   were for a one month supply  with most of the balance being for three months 
as of december   approximately of shipped product is for no cost use by patients enrolled in the ampyra patient assistance program 

table of contents our managed markets representatives continue to meet with payors to provide information on ampyra and discuss patient access 
as of december   approximately of commercially insured individuals had no or limited prior authorizations pas for ampyra 
we define limited pas as those that require only an ms diagnosis  documentation of no contraindications  and or simple documentation that the patient has walking impairment  such documentation may include a timed foot walk tw test 
as of december   approximately of commercially insured individuals were subject to more restrictive pas  which may include requirements for multiple timed walk tests and or edss expanded disability status scale score requirements to initiate therapy  and or objective measures of ambulation improvement to reauthorize ampyra therapy 
we estimate that  as of december   approximately of commercially insured individuals were blocked from receiving reimbursement for ampyra 
access figures were calculated based on the number of pharmacy lives reported by commercial healthcare plans 
as of december   inventory levels at the specialty pharmacy providers that distribute ampyra excluding kaiser were approximately two weeks 
the specialty pharmacy providers and kaiser are contractually obligated to hold no more than days of inventory 
the fda granted ampyra orphan drug status  which provides seven years of market exclusivity for the drug 
in addition  we have issued patents that cover the formulation and use of ampyra 
we filed for patent term extension for ampyra pursuant to the provisions of the hatch waxman act that allows for up to five additional years of patent protection based on the development timeline of a drug 
although we have applied to extend both ampyra patents listed in the fda orange book  we will ultimately need to select only one patent for extension  if each is granted 
in  we received non final rejection letters from the us patent and trademark office uspto on two patent applications for ampyra filed in late and early in november  we timely responded to the letter regarding the application 
we have until march  to respond to the letter regarding the application  and we expect to file a timely response 
in november  the european patent office epo posted a communication of intention to grant a patent for a patent application we submitted with composition for use and other use claims directed to sustained release aminopyridine compositions for  among other things  increased walking speed  improving lower extremity muscle strength  or improving lower extremity muscle tone  in patients with ms 
the grant fee for this application is due in march  and we expect to timely file this fee 
a corresponding patent is currently under review by the uspto 
the uspto operates independently of the epo  and the epo s decision should not be taken to indicate the outcome for the us patent 
in june  we entered into the collaboration agreement with biogen idec 
in january  biogen idec announced that it submitted a centralized marketing authorization application maa to the european medicines agency ema and a new drug submission nds to health canada for ampyra  which is known outside the us as fampridine 
in january the ema s committee for medicinal products for human use chmp decided against approval 
biogen idec has filed an appeal to request a re examination of the decision by the chmp 
biogen idec received a notice of deficiency from health canada regarding its application for approval of fampyra in canada  to which it intends to respond 
health canada will have approximately a year to reply to that response 
we have three research and development programs focused on novel approaches to repair damaged components of the cns 
we believe all of our research and development programs neuregulins  remyelinating antibodies and chondroitinase have broad applicability and have the potential to be first in class therapies 
while these programs have initially been focused on ms and spinal cord injury sci  we believe they may be applicable across a number of cns disorders  including stroke and traumatic brain injury  because many of the mechanisms of tissue damage and repair are similar 
in addition  we believe that these programs may have applicability beyond the nervous system  including in such fields as cardiology  oncology  orthopedics and ophthalmology 
in march  we filed an investigational new drug ind application for glial growth factor ggf  the lead product candidate for our neuregulins program  as a therapy for heart failure  and in april the ind became effective 
in december  the first patient was enrolled in the first clinical trial of ggf acorda is collaborating with the vanderbilt university heart and vascular institute to conduct this phase single dose trial in patients with heart failure 
if we are able to establish a proof of concept for treatment of heart failure through human clinical studies  we may decide to develop the product either by entering into a partnership  most likely with a cardiovascular focused company  or developing it on our own 
we and vanderbilt university received a million cardiac translational research implementation program c trip grant from the national heart  lung and blood institute nhlbi to support research on ggf separate from the phase clinical trial 
if these studies are successful  acorda and vanderbilt will be eligible to apply for a second phase c trip grant of at least million 
we began work with a contract manufacturer in to scale up manufacturing and purification processes for one of the remyelinating antibodies  rhigm  under cgmp for preparation for a future ind application 
these manufacturing processes have been completed and we are now in formal preclinical safety and toxicity studies 
if rhigm proves to have a satisfactory preclinical safety profile  we expect to file an ind for the treatment of ms 
we also are continuing research on the potential use of chondroitinases for the treatment of injuries to the brain and spinal cord 
the chondroitinase program is in the research and translational development phases and has not yet entered formal preclinical development 

table of contents we have had significant operating losses since inception as a result of our focus on clinical and research and development activities and our goal of building an internal sales  managed markets and marketing organization in the us we may incur losses for the next several years as we continue to support an expanded sales and marketing organization and other activities in connection with the commercialization of ampyra and the advancement of our clinical and preclinical development programs 
we currently expect ampyra full year net revenue to increase to million 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the full year are currently expected to be million excluding share based compensation charges 
sg a will be primarily driven by commercial and administrative costs related to ampyra 
research and development r d expenses for the full year are currently expected to be million excluding share based compensation charges 
r d expenses in include post marketing studies for ampyra and continuing development expenses for our pipeline products  including phase clinical trials for ggf the projected amounts of sg a and r d for the full year in this paragraph and elsewhere in this report are non gaap financial measures 
non gaap financial measures are financial measures that exclude amounts  or which are subject to adjustments that have the effect of excluding amounts  that are included in the most directly comparable measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
non gaap financial measures are not an alternative for financial measures prepared in accordance with gaap 
however  we believe the presentation of these non gaap financial measures provides useful information to investors because they exclude non cash charges that are substantially dependent on future changes in the market price of our common stock 
therefore  we believe that the use of these non gaap financial measures provides investors with a meaningful understanding of our projected operating performance 
we have not provided corresponding forward looking gaap financial measures 
such forward looking gaap measures are not accessible to us because  among other reasons  we cannot predict the future market prices of our common stock 
we will also continue to explore opportunities to expand our pipeline through the potential in licensing and or acquisition of select products and technologies in neurology 
we are interested in both clinical and commercial state products  with a particular focus on phase product candidates  although we are open to assessing compounds at other stages as well 
we do not currently plan to acquire a marketed product for launch during the first year of ampyra commercial launch 
in august  the company received a paragraph iv certification notice from apotex inc advising that it had submitted an anda to the fda seeking marketing approval for generic versions of zanaflex capsules 
in october  the company filed a lawsuit against apotex corp 
and apotex inc collectively  apotex for patent infringement in relation to the filing of the anda by apotex 
the defendants answered the company s complaint  asserting patent invalidity and non infringement and counterclaiming  seeking a declaratory judgment of patent invalidity and non infringement 
the company denied those counterclaims 
in march  apotex filed a motion  which the company opposed  for partial judgment on the pleadings dismissing the company s request for relief on the ground that the case is exceptional under usc e or the court ruled in the company s favor and denied apotex s motion in december fact discovery in the case has been completed 
on july   the us district court held a markman hearing to determine the interpretation of certain terms in the company s zanaflex capsules patent that is at issue in this litigation 
the court ruled favorably on a number of those terms  and the case is proceeding 
a trial date of april  has been set by the court 
our timely filing of a lawsuit against apotex in october triggered an automatic stay on fda approval of the apotex anda for months 
that stay expired in march consequently  apotex will be able to receive fda approval of its anda  if apotex is able otherwise to satisfy fda review requirements for andas  at which time it could begin selling a generic tizanidine hydrochloride capsule in competition with zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets  even if our patent litigation remains pending 
if apotex begins selling its product before it is successful in challenging the validity  infringement  or enforceability of our patent  apotex would be selling at the risk of our ultimately prevailing on our patent infringement claims and its being held liable for damages for patent infringement 

table of contents the company accrues for amounts related to loss contingencies if it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as of december   there have been no accruals for loss contingencies aside from payments related to the litigation itself 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue total net revenues are summarized in the following table year ended december  year ended december  gross product sales ampyra zanaflex total gross product sales discounts and allowances ampyra zanaflex total discounts and allowances license and royalty revenue ampyra zanaflex total license revenue total net revenue we currently expect ampyra full year net revenue to increase to million 
gross product sales ampyra we recognize product sales of ampyra following shipment of product to a network of specialty pharmacy providers and kaiser 
we recognized gross revenue from the sale of ampyra of million for the year ended december  zanaflex we recognize product sales of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets using a deferred revenue recognition model where shipments to wholesalers are recorded as deferred revenue and only recognized as revenue when end user prescriptions of the product are reported 
we recognized revenue from the sale of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets of million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a decrease in both shipments and prescriptions due to increasing managed care pressure  among other factors  partially offset by a price increase for zanaflex capsules effective february  and a price increase for zanaflex capsules and tablets effective november  sales of zanaflex capsules may decline in 
table of contents discounts and allowances ampyra we recorded discounts and allowances of million for the year ended december  which consists of allowances for customer credits  including estimated rebates  discounts and returns 
discounts and allowances are recorded following shipment of ampyra tablets to our network of specialty pharmacy providers and kaiser 
discounts and allowances consisted of million for copay mitigation allowances  million for cash discounts and allowances  million for government chargebacks and rebate allowances   for product returns allowances  and  for managed care contract rebate allowances 
discounts and allowances may increase as a percentage of sales as we enter into managed care contracts in the future and start to incur costs in related to new healthcare reform medicare rebates described under the healthcare reform header below 
zanaflex we recorded discounts and allowances of million for the year ended december  as compared to million the year ended december  adjustments are recorded for estimated chargebacks  rebates  and discounts 
discounts and allowances for the year ended december  consisted of million in allowances for government chargebacks and rebates  million in fees for services payable to wholesalers  and million in cash discounts and allowances 
discounts and allowances for the year ended december  consisted of million in allowances for government chargebacks and rebates  million in fees for services payable to wholesalers and million in cash discounts and allowances 
healthcare reform in march  healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the us this legislation contains several provisions that will affect our business 
although many provisions of the new legislation do not take effect immediately  several provisions became effective in the first quarter of the changes did not have a material impact on our discounts and allowances 
beginning in  the new law requires drug manufacturers to provide a discount to medicare beneficiaries whose prescription drug costs cause them to be subject to the medicare part d coverage gap ie  the donut hole 
at this time  although we have estimated a range of potential impact  we may not be able to accurately quantify what the potential impact will be for us 
also  beginning in  we will be assessed our share of a new fee which will not be deductible for tax purposes payable by all branded prescription drug manufacturers and importers 
this fee will be based on each drug manufacturers market share for certain drugs 
we do not expect this fee to have a material impact on our financial statements in license and royalty revenue the company recognized million in license and royalty revenue related to the million received from biogen idec in july for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to recognition of a full year of revenue in versus a half year of recognition in on january  biogen idec announced that the european medicines agency s ema committee for medicinal products for human use chmp decided against approval of fampridine to improve walking ability in adult patients with multiple sclerosis 
biogen idec has appealed this opinion and requested a re examination of the decision by the chmp 
we are currently evaluating the impact on the period for the amortization of the deferred collaboration revenue and cost of license revenue  but it is likely to increase the amortization period and therefore decrease the amount of revenue recognized per period in the future 

table of contents cost of sales ampyra we recorded cost of sales of million for the year ended december  cost of sales for the year ended december  consisted primarily of million in inventory costs related to recognized revenues 
our launch stock inventory was received in bulk form prior to regulatory approval  therefore  the manufacturing cost associated with this material was classified as research and development expense as there was no alternative future use prior to regulatory approval 
this expensed bulk form material represented approximately of the total cost basis of our launch stock inventory 
the remaining packaged portion of the inventory cost was incurred after regulatory approval and thus capitalized 
this reduction to our cost basis effectively reduced our cost of sales related to recognized revenues by approximately million for the year ended december  our reduced cost basis inventory was sold during the year ended december  and as of this date we are not carrying any launch inventory on our balance sheet with a reduced costs basis 
cost of sales for the year ended december  also consisted of million in royalty fees based on net sales   in amortization of intangible assets  and  in period costs related to packaging  freight and stability testing 
zanaflex we recorded cost of sales of million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  cost of sales for the year ended december  consisted of million in inventory costs primarily related to recognized revenues  million in royalty fees based on net product shipments  million in amortization of intangible assets  which is unrelated to either the volume of shipments or the amount of revenue recognized  and  in period costs related to freight and stability testing

payments to and interest expense related to the prf transaction discussed below in the section titled liquidity and capital resources do not impact the company s cost of sales 
research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million  or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in regulatory expenses of million which were incurred in related to nda preparation and support for ampyra 
the decrease was also related to a reduction in expenses allocated to research and development of million for ampyra manufacturing and stability work that was classified as research and development for the year ended december  as it was incurred prior to fda approval of the drug 
further  the decrease resulted from a decrease of million and  in preclinical work on two of our pipeline products remyelinating antibodies rhigm and ggf  respectively 
we initialized work with a contract manufacturer in on rhigm to scale up manufacturing and purification processes under current good manufacturing practices  or cgmp  in preparation for a future ind application 
these manufacturing processes have been completed and we are now working on formal preclinical safety and toxicity studies 
in  we began work with a contract manufacturer to develop production and purification methods for manufacturing ggf under cgmp 
the bulk of this work was completed in culminating in our submission of an ind application in march 
table of contents the overall decrease in research and development expense was also partially offset by an increase in overall research and development staff and compensation of million to support various pipeline initiatives as well as three milestone payments  totaling million  paid during the year ended december  which were related to the filing of the ind for ggf two milestone payments were for  each payable to paion ag formerly cenes and one was for  payable to brigham and women s hospital 
the decrease in research and development expense was partially offset by an increase of  for clinical costs associated with the close out of our ms extension study sites and overall increase in clinical staff and compensation to support the movement of one of our preclinical pipeline product candidates into the clinic  as well as an increase of  for the start up of a phase i ggf clinical trial 
the decrease in research and development expense was further offset by an increase of  related to the start up of a clinical trial and manufacturing and stability work for post marketing studies of ampyra 
research and development r d expenses for the full year are currently expected to be million excluding share based compensation charges 
r d expenses in include post marketing studies for ampyra and continuing development expenses for our pipeline products  including phase clinical trials for ggf selling  general and administrative sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in staff and compensation of million resulting from the expansion of our field sales staff and the overall commercial department in order to support the launch of ampyra as well as an increase of million in marketing  trade and distribution expenses  managed markets  and various launch activities associated with ampyra 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or

selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the full year are currently expected to be million excluding share based compensation charges 
sg a will be primarily driven by commercial and administrative costs related to ampyra 
other expense other expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately  or 
the increase was primarily due to a decrease in interest income of million resulting from a lower average interest rate and lower cash balances for the same period in the decrease in interest income was partially offset by a  decrease in interest expense principally related to the prf revenue interest agreement 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross product sales we recognize product sales of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets sales using a deferred revenue recognition model where shipments to wholesalers are recorded as deferred revenue and only recognized as revenue when end user prescriptions of the product are reported 
we recognized gross sales from the sale of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets of million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or 
the increase was due to a price increase effective january   offset by a slight downward trend in dollarized prescriptions for zanaflex capsules observed beginning in the second quarter of 
table of contents discounts and allowances we recorded discounts and allowances with respect to zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets of million for the year ended december  as compared to a million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million or

table of contents research and development research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of approximately million  or 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the conclusion of our phase clinical trial of ampyra in  resulting in a decrease to ms clinical development program expense of million or to million coupled with our acquisition of certain in process research and development assets of neurorecovery  inc nri during the three month period ended march   resulting in a one time non cash expense of approximately million 
in addition  nda preparation costs decreased million or to million as the majority of the work for our submission to the fda was completed in these decreases were offset by an increase in preclinical research and development expense of million or to million primarily related to work on two of our preclinical pipeline products  ggf neuregulins and remyelinating antibodies  including an increase in staff and compensation to support these initiatives 
this overall increase in expense was primarily associated with animal toxicology expenses and the development of larger scale manufacturing and purification processes for ggf  under cgmp  in preparation for a potential future ind application to support human clinical trials 
the overall decrease in research and development expense was also offset by an increase in clinical and regulatory staff and compensation of million or to million to support the overall growth of the organization and an increase in manufacturing and stability fees for ampyra of  or to million 
research and development expenses are expected to increase in over due to the continued development of the company s pre clinical programs  including expected initiation of a ggf phase study  and implementation of our post marketing study commitments for ampyra 
selling  general and administrative sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or 
this increase was primarily attributable to an increase of million for pre launch activities in anticipation of commercialization of ampyra 
in addition  we realized an increase in sales and marketing staff and compensation of  to support promotion of zanaflex capsules and ampyra pre launch activities and an increase in corporate communications costs of  these increases were offset by a decrease in other selling related expenses of  which primarily represents a reduction in field staff costs and a decrease in zanaflex capsules marketing expenses of  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or 
this increase was the result of an increase in staff and compensation and other expenses related to supporting the growth of the overall organization and our medical affairs program of million  an increase in costs associated with medical affairs research and educational programs of million  an increase in business development expenses of  related to our collaboration and licensing agreement efforts  and an increase in legal fees of approximately  other expense other expense was million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december   an increase of approximately million  or 
the increase was primarily due to a decrease in investment interest income of million resulting from a lower average interest rate than for the same period in this decrease was offset by a decrease in interest expense of million under the prf revenue interest agreement as a result of the impact of a million out of period adjustment made during the second quarter of to correct an error identified in the previously recorded effective interest expense related to the november amended revenue interests assignment agreement with prf 
this out of period adjustment did not increase the total interest expense associated with this agreement 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have incurred annual operating losses since inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have financed our operations primarily through private placements of our securities  public offerings of our common stock  our collaboration and licensing agreement  sales of zanaflex capsules and ampyra  and  to a lesser extent  from loans  government grants and our financing arrangement with prf 
financing arrangements in january  elan international services  ltd 
eis loaned us an aggregate of million pursuant to two convertible promissory notes to partly fund our research and development activities 
on december   elan transferred these promissory notes to funds affiliated with saints capital 
as of december   million of these promissory notes plus million of accrued interest was outstanding 
the first of seven annual payments on this note was due and was paid on the one year anniversary after ampyra approval on january  in january  we entered into a million senior secured term loan which was repaid during the three month period ended march  on december   we entered into a revenue interest assignment agreement with prf  a dedicated healthcare investment fund  pursuant to which we assigned to prf the right to a portion of our net revenues as defined in the agreement from zanaflex capsules  zanaflex tablets and any future zanaflex products 
to secure our obligations to prf  we also granted prf a security interest in substantially all of our assets related to zanaflex 
our agreement with prf covers all zanaflex net revenues generated from october  through and including december   unless the agreement terminates earlier 
in november  we entered into an amendment to the revenue interest assignment agreement with prf 
under the terms of the amendment  prf paid us million in november and an additional million in february since our net revenues during the fiscal year exceeded million 
under the terms of the amendment  we were required to pay prf million on december  and an additional million on december  these payments were made 
under the agreement and the amendment  prf is entitled to the following portion of zanaflex net revenues with respect to zanaflex net revenues up to and including million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues  with respect to zanaflex net revenues in excess of million but less than and including million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues  and with respect to zanaflex net revenues in excess of million for each fiscal year during the term of the agreement  of such net revenues 
notwithstanding the foregoing  once prf has received and retained payments under the agreement that are at least times the aggregate amount prf has paid us under the agreement  prf will only be entitled to of zanaflex net revenues 
in connection with the transaction  we recorded a liability as of december   referred to as the revenue interest liability  of approximately million 
we impute interest expense associated with this liability using the effective interest rate method and record a corresponding accrued interest liability 
the effective interest rate is calculated based on the rate that would enable the debt to be repaid in full over the life of the arrangement 
the interest rate on this liability may vary during the term of the agreement depending on a number of factors  including the level of zanaflex sales 
we currently estimate that the imputed interest rate associated with this liability will be approximately 
payments made to prf as a result of zanaflex sales levels will reduce the accrued interest liability and the principal amount of the revenue interest liability 

table of contents upon the occurrence of certain events  including if we experience a change of control  undergo certain bankruptcy events  transfer any of our interests in zanaflex other than pursuant to a license agreement  development  commercialization  co promotion  collaboration  partnering or similar agreement  transfer all or substantially all of our assets  or breach certain of the covenants  representations or warranties we make under the agreement  prf may i require us to repurchase the rights we sold them at the put call price in effect on the date such right is exercised or ii foreclose on the zanaflex assets that secure our obligations to prf 
except in the case of certain bankruptcy events  if prf exercises its right  which we refer to as prf s put option  to cause us to repurchase the rights we assigned to it  prf may not foreclose unless we fail to pay the put call price as required 
if we experience a change of control we have the right  which we refer to as our call option  to repurchase the rights we sold to prf at the put call price in effect on the date such right is exercised 
the put call price on a given date is the greater of i all payments made by prf to us as of such date  less all payments received by prf from us as of such date  and ii an amount that would generate an internal rate of return to prf of on all payments made by prf to us as of such date  taking into account the amount and timing of all payments received by prf from us as of such date 
we have determined that prf s put option and our call option meet the criteria to be considered an embedded derivative and should be accounted for as such 
therefore  we recorded a net liability of  as of december  related to the put call option to reflect its current estimated fair value 
this liability is revalued on a semi annual basis to reflect any changes in the fair value and any gain or loss resulting from the revaluation is recorded in earnings 
during any period during which prf has the right to receive of zanaflex net revenues as defined in the agreement  then of the first million in payments from zanaflex sales we receive from wholesalers will be distributed to prf on a daily basis 
following the end of each fiscal quarter  if the aggregate amount actually received by prf during such quarter exceeds the amount of net revenues prf was entitled to receive  prf will remit such excess to us 
if the amount of net revenues prf was entitled to receive during such quarter exceeds the aggregate amount actually received by prf during such quarter  we will remit such excess to prf 
investment activities at december   cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were approximately million  as compared to million at december  our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at date of purchase and consist of time deposits and investments in a treasury money market fund and high quality government bonds 
also  we maintain cash balances with financial institutions in excess of insured limits 
we do not anticipate any losses with respect to such cash balances 
as of december   our cash and cash equivalents were million  as compared to million as of december  our short term investments consist of us treasury bonds with original maturities greater than three months and less than one year 
the balance of these investments was million as of december   as compared to million as of december  net cash provided by used in operations net cash used in operations was million and million for year ended december  and  respectively 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory held by the company of million due to the purchase of ampyra launch stock and additional ampyra inventory to meet demand which was launched in  an increase in accounts receivable of million resulting from an increase in gross product sales for ampyra which was launched in  a net loss of million  and a decrease in the non current portion of deferred license revenue of million due to the amortization of the upfront collaboration payment received during the three month period ended september  cash used in operations for the year ended december  also included a net increase of million due to changes in other working capital items 
cash used in operations was partially offset by a non cash share based compensation expense of million  amortization of net premiums and discounts on short term investments of million  and depreciation and amortization of million 
cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to an increase in deferred license revenue of million  a non cash share based compensation expense of million  amortization of the discount on short term investments of million  depreciation and amortization of million  and a loss on our put call liability related to the zanaflex revenue interest liability of  cash provided by operations for the year ended december  also included a net increase of million due to changes in other working capital items 
cash provided by operations for the year ended december  was partially offset by a net loss of million and an increase in non current portion of deferred cost of license revenue of million 

table of contents net cash provided by investing net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to million in proceeds from maturities and sales of short term investments partially offset by million in purchases of short term investments  purchases of intangible assets of million  and purchases of property and equipment of million 
net cash provided by financing net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to million in net proceeds from the issuance of common stock and exercise of stock options partially offset by million in repayments to prf and million of purchases of treasury stock 
future capital needs we currently expect ampyra full year net revenue to increase to million 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses for the full year are currently expected to be million excluding share based compensation charges 
sg a will be primarily driven by commercial and administrative costs related to ampyra 
research and development r d expenses for the full year are currently expected to be million excluding share based compensation charges 
r d expenses in include post marketing studies for ampyra and continuing development expenses for our pipeline products  including phase clinical trials for ggf our future capital requirements will depend on a number of factors  including the amount of revenue generated from sales of ampyra and zanaflex capsules  the continued progress of our research and development activities  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  the amount and timing of milestone or other payments made under collaborative agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights and acquisition or in licensing of new products or compounds and development costs relating to those new products or compounds 
we may continue to incur losses from operations as we continue to support our sales and marketing infrastructure for the commercialization of ampyra and zanaflex capsules  increase our efforts to support the sales of ampyra  and continue our clinical development and advance our preclinical programs 
to the extent our capital resources are insufficient to meet future operating requirements we will need to raise additional capital  reduce planned expenditures  or incur indebtedness to fund its operations 
we may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail our sales and marketing efforts  delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate some of our research and development programs or obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain product candidates that we might otherwise seek to develop or commercialize independently 
contractual obligations and commitments our long term contractual obligations include commitments and estimated purchase obligations entered into in the normal course of business 
under certain supply agreements and other agreements with manufacturers and suppliers  we are required to make payments for the manufacture and supply of our clinical and approved products 
our major outstanding contractual obligations are for payments related to our convertible notes  our facility leases and our commitments to purchase inventory 
the following table summarizes our minimum significant contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 

table of contents payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years convertible note payable operating leases inventory purchase commitments total excludes prf principal and interest payments  due to uncertainty as to the amount and timing of such payments 
represents annual payments of principal and interest to be made on the convertible note payable to saints capital starting on january  the first anniversary of ampyra fda approval 
represents zanaflex and ampyra inventory commitments 
the ampyra inventory commitment is an estimate as the price paid for ampyra inventory is based on a percentage of the net product sales during the quarter elan ships inventory to us 
under our supply agreement with elan  we provide elan with monthly written month forecasts  and with annual written five year forecasts for our supply requirements of ampyra and two year forecasts for our supply requirements of zanaflex capsules 
in each of the five months for zanaflex and three months for ampyra following the submission of our written month forecast we are obligated to purchase the quantity specified in the forecast  even if our actual requirements are greater or less 
we have agreed to purchase at least of our annual requirements of ampyra from elan  unless elan is unable or unwilling to meet its requirements  for a percentage of net product sales and the quantity of product shipped by elan to us 
under certain license agreements  we are required to pay royalties for the use of technologies and products in our r d activities and in the commercialization of products 
the amount and timing of any of the foregoing payments are not known due to the uncertainty surrounding the successful research  development and commercialization of the products 
under certain license agreements  we are also required to pay license fees and milestones for the use of technologies and products in our r d activities and in the commercialization of products 
we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties of up to approximately million as part of our various collaborations  including licensing and development programs 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones had not occurred as of december   such contingencies have not been recorded in our financial statements 
amounts related to contingent milestone payments are not considered contractual obligations as they are contingent on the successful achievement of certain development  regulatory and commercial milestones 
there is uncertainty regarding the various activities and outcomes needed to reach these milestones  and they may not be achieved 
effects of inflation our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  primarily employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion of critical accounting policies identifies the accounting policies that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
it is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our significant accounting policies  which are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this document 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which the selection of an available alternative policy would not produce a materially different result 

table of contents revenue recognition ampyra ampyra is available only through a network of specialty pharmacy providers that provide the medication to patients by mail and kaiser permanente kaiser 
we recognize revenue by applying the guidance in staff accounting bulletin sab which requires that we do not recognize revenue from product sales until there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  the buyer is obligated to pay us  the obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer has economic substance apart from us  the company has no obligation to bring about the sale of the product  the amount of returns can be reasonably estimated and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize product sales of ampyra following shipment of product to a network of specialty pharmacy providers and kaiser 
as of december   inventory levels at specialty pharmacy providers that distribute ampyra does not include kaiser represented approximately two weeks of their anticipated usage 
the specialty pharmacy providers and kaiser are contractually obligated to hold no more than days of inventory 
our net revenues represent total revenues less allowances for customer credits  including estimated rebates  discounts and returns 
these allowances are recorded for cash consideration given by a vendor to a customer that is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products or services and  therefore  are characterized as a reduction of revenue 
at the time product is shipped to specialty pharmacies and kaiser  an adjustment is recorded for estimated chargebacks  rebates  and returns 
these allowances are established by management as its best estimate based on available information and will be adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
in determining the amounts of certain allowances and accruals  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
allowances for rebates  discounts and returns are established based on the contractual terms with customers  communications with customers and the levels of inventory remaining in the distribution channel  as well as expectations about the market for each product and anticipated introduction of competitive products 
product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
based on our specialty distribution model where we sell to only specialty pharmacy providers and kaiser  the data we receive from these distributors  and returns experience of other specialty products with similar selling models  we have been able to make a reasonable estimate for product returns 
at december   inventory levels at the specialty pharmacy providers this does not include kaiser represented approximately two weeks of their anticipated usage 
the specialty pharmacy providers and kaiser have contractually agreed to hold no more than days of inventory 
we will accept returns of ampyra for two months prior to and six months after its expiration date 
we will provide a credit to customers with whom we have a direct relationship 
once our product is prescribed  it cannot be returned 
we do not exchange product from inventory for the returned product 
zanaflex we apply the revenue recognition guidance in accounting standards codification asc  which among other criteria requires that future returns can be reasonably estimated in order to recognize revenue 
we have accumulated some sales history with zanaflex capsules  however  due to existing and potential generic competition and customer conversion from zanaflex tablets to zanaflex capsules  we cannot reasonably determine a return rate at this time and  thus  are not permitted to recognize revenue based on shipments to wholesalers 
as a result  we account for sales of these products using a deferred revenue recognition model 
we continue to accumulate data and when we are able to reasonably estimate product returns based on this data and based on greater certainty regarding generic competition we will then begin to recognize revenue based on shipments of product to our wholesale drug distributors 

table of contents under our deferred revenue model  we do not recognize revenue following shipment of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets to our wholesale drug distributors 
instead  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  and classify the cost basis of the inventory held by the wholesaler as a component of inventory 
we recognize revenue when prescriptions are filled to an end user because once a prescription is filled the product cannot be returned 
we use monthly prescription data that we purchase to determine the amount of revenue to be recognized 
when we receive the prescription data  we use the number of units of product prescribed to record gross sales 
we then reduce deferred revenue and record cost of goods sold 
in addition to the prescription data we purchase  we also receive data that we use to monitor trends in sales from wholesalers to their customers 
we receive this data from an outside vendor on a monthly basis 
this data includes the number of bottles shipped from certain wholesalers to their customers 
we also compare our shipments to wholesalers to prescription reports to further assess inventory in the distribution channel on a monthly basis 
we use the wholesaler sales trend data and the wholesaler vs 
prescription comparison to better understand market conditions  but not as a basis for recognizing revenue 
we have not made any shipments as a result of incentives to our wholesalers and our policy is not to ship in excess of our wholesalers inventory levels maintained in the ordinary course of business 
our net revenues represent total revenues less allowances for customer credits  including estimated discounts  rebates  and chargebacks 
these allowances are recorded for cash consideration given by a vendor to a customer that is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendor s products or services and  therefore  should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendor s statement of income 
adjustments are recorded for estimated chargebacks  rebates  and discounts 
these allowances are established by management as its best estimate based on available information and are adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
allowances for chargebacks  rebates and discounts are established based on the contractual terms with customers  analysis of historical levels of discounts  chargebacks and rebates  communications with customers and the levels of inventory remaining in the distribution channel  as well as expectations about the market for each product and anticipated introduction of competitive products 
product shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
we accept returns of zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets for six months prior to and twelve months after their expiration date 
we provide a credit to customers with whom we have a direct relationship or a cash payment to those with whom we do not have a direct relationship 
we do not exchange product from inventory for the returned product 
returns of products sold by us are charged directly against deferred revenue  reducing the amount of deferred revenue that we may recognize 
in addition  we record a charge to cost of goods sold for the cost basis of the estimated product returns we believe may ultimately be realized at the time of product shipment to wholesalers 
we recognize this charge at the date of shipment since it is probable that we will receive a level of returned products  upon the return of such product we will be unable to resell the product considering its expiration dating  and  we can reasonably estimate a range of returns 
this charge represents the cost basis for the low end of the range of the company s estimated returns 
the charge to cost of goods sold amounted to  and  for the years ended december  and respectively 
a change in this expense estimate would have had an approximate  and  effect on the company s cost of sales for the years ended december  and  respectively 
discounts and allowances ampyra reserves for ampyra with respect to customer credits  including estimated rebates  discounts and returns  have been established 
discounts and allowances are recorded following shipment of ampyra tablets to our network of specialty pharmacy providers and kaiser and the appropriate reserves are credited 
these allowances are established by management as its best estimate of historical experience and data points available and are adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
allowances for customer credits  rebates  and discounts are established based on contractual terms with customers and analyses of historical usage of these items 
the nature of the company s allowances and accruals requiring critical estimates  and the specific considerations it uses in estimating their amounts are as follows 
table of contents government chargebacks and rebates the company contracts with medicaid and other government agencies such as the federal supply schedule which commits us to providing those agencies with our most favorable pricing 
this ensures that our products remain eligible for purchase or reimbursement under these government funded programs 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to sales through each of these channels  we provide an allowance for chargebacks and rebates 
we monitor the sales trends and adjust the chargebacks and rebate percentages on a regular basis to reflect the most recent chargebacks and rebate experience 
the company s chargebacks and rebate accruals were million at december  a change in the company s chargebacks and rebate allowances would have had an approximate  effect on the company s net revenue for the year ended december  managed care contract rebates the company contracts with various managed care organizations including health insurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers in order to provide improved access to ampyra for patients that are members of such organizations 
these contracts stipulate that rebates and  in some cases  administrative fees  are paid to these organizations provided ampyra is represented as a specific tier on the organizations drug formulary 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to sales through managed care channels  we provide an allowance for managed care contract rebates 
we began to enter into these contracts during the three months ended december  we will monitor the sales trends and adjust the allowance on a regular basis to reflect the most recent rebate experience 
the company s managed care contract rebate accruals were  at december  a change in the company s managed care contract rebate allowances would have had an approximate  effect on the company s net revenue for the year ended december copay mitigation rebates the company offers copay mitigation to commercially insured patients who have coverage for ampyra and do not reside in states excluded from receiving copay mitigation and are responsible for a cost share regardless of financial need income status 
the copay mitigation program is intended to reduce the patient s financial responsibility for ampyra to a specified dollar amount 
based upon our contracts and the most recent experience with respect to actual copay assistance provided  we provide an allowance for copay mitigation rebates 
we monitor the sales trends and adjust the rebate percentages on a regular basis to reflect the most recent rebate experience 
the company s copay mitigation rebate accruals were  at december  a change in the company s managed care contract rebate allowances would have had an approximate  effect on the company s net revenue for the year ended december  cash discounts and allowances the company sells ampyra directly to its network of specialty pharmacies and kaiser and generally provides invoice discounts for prompt payment 
the company estimates its cash discounts based on the terms offered to the specialty pharmacies and kaiser 
discounts are accrued based on historical usage rates at the time of product shipment 
we adjust accruals based on actual activity as necessary 
cash discounts are typically settled with wholesalers within days after the end of each calendar month 
the company has also contracted with the specialty pharmacies to obtain transactional data in order to ascertain a better understanding of our selling channel as well as patient activity and utilization by the medicaid program and other government agencies and managed care organizations 
these contracts stipulate that the specialty pharmacies provide data directly to the company  as well as indirectly through ampyra patient support services apss  which in turn provides data to the company 
a data fee is paid by the company to the specialty pharmacies for each line of data provided and the company provides an allowance for these data fees 
a line of data is defined as data pertaining to a single prescription 
the company s cash discounts and allowances accruals were  at december  a change in the company s cash discounts and allowances would have had an approximate  effect on the company s net revenue for the year ended december  
table of contents product returns our specialty pharmacies have the right to return any unopened product during the eight month period beginning two months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending six months after the labeled expiration date 
once product has been prescribed  it is no longer eligible for return 
when specialty pharmacies return product  they will be given a credit against amounts owed 
the company does not replace returned product with new product 
as of the year ended december   the company has not received any product returns 
ampyra has been granted orphan drug status  meaning that the product should not be subject to generic competitors for at least seven years post approval 
while we do not have the benefit of our own historical data for a product similar to ampyra  we compared reserve rates employed by companies with similar selling models or products ie other specialty pharmaceutical products 
based on the our specialty distribution model sales to only a limited number of specialty pharmacies and kaiser  the data we receive from our specialty pharmacies  the returns experience of other specialty products with similar selling models and the fact that the specialty pharmacies and kaiser have contractually agreed to hold no more than days worth of product stock  we expect the returns rate for ampyra will be low  similar to other specialty distribution models 
we consider the past buying patterns our specialty pharmacies and kaiser  the estimated remaining shelf life of product previously shipped  the expiration dates of product currently being shipped  our own price changes and those of competitive products  and introductions of generic products as applicable to determine our return rate 
the company s returns accrual was  at december  a change in the company s returns allowance would have had an approximate  effect on the company s net revenue for the year ended december  zanaflex reserves with respect to zanaflex capsules and zanaflex tablets for wholesaler fees for services  cash discounts  medicaid and patient program rebates and chargebacks have been established

cash discounts and allowances the company sells directly to wholesalers and generally provides invoice discounts for prompt payment 
the company also has an allowance for patient rebate incentives in place for which it reduces gross product revenue 
the patient program rebates are in the form of preferred cards and rebate coupons which offer a reduction to the price paid by the patient at the time of prescription fill 
cards and coupons are shipped directly to physicians based on request and are given to the patients by the prescribing physician 
the company estimates its cash discounts and allowances based on the terms offered to its wholesalers and the actual cards and coupons shipped versus processed  respectively 
discounts are accrued based on historical usage rates at the time of product shipment and rebates at the time the rebate card or coupon is sent out to a physician based on historical redemption rates 
we adjust accruals based on actual activity as necessary 
cash discounts are typically settled with wholesalers within days after the end of each calendar month 
rebates are typically settled within days after the end of each calendar quarter 
the company s cash discounts and allowances were  and  at december  and december   respectively

the company estimates its fee for service accruals and allowances based on sales to each wholesaler and the applicable contracted rate 
the company s fee for service expenses are accrued at the time of product shipment and are typically settled with the wholesalers within days after the end of each respective quarter 
the company s fee for service accruals were  and  at december  and december   respectively 
a change in the company s fee for service allowances would have had an approximate  and  effect on the company s net revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has adjusted its allowances in the past based on actual experience  and the company will likely be required to make adjustments to these allowances and accruals in the future 
the historical adjustments have not been significant to operations 
the company continually monitors its allowances and accruals and makes adjustments when the company believes actual experience may differ from its estimates

table of contents license revenue and cost of license revenue under the collaboration agreement with biogen idec  we were entitled to a non refundable upfront payment of million as of june   the date of the agreement  which was received on july  as a result of such payment to us  million became payable by us to elan under our existing agreements with elan 
these agreements obligate us to pay an amount equal to of any upfront and milestone payments that we receive from the sublicensing of rights to ampyra or other aminopyridine products 
as of december  we estimated the revenue recognition period for the upfront payment that we received from biogen idec  and for any milestone payments made to us by biogen idec  and for the corresponding payments that we make to elan  to be approximately years 
on january  biogen idec announced that the european medicines agency s ema committee for medicinal products for human use chmp decided against approval of fampridine to improve walking ability in adult patients with multiple sclerosis 
biogen idec has appealed this opinion and requested a re examination of the decision by the chmp 
we are currently evaluating the impact on the period for the amortization of the deferred collaboration revenue and cost of license revenue  but it is likely to increase the amortization period and therefore decrease the amount of revenue recognized per period in the future 
ampyra inventory prior to regulatory approval of ampyra  the company incurred expenses for the manufacture of several batches of ampyra that ultimately became available to support the commercial launch of this drug candidate 
until the necessary initial regulatory approval was received  we charged all such amounts to research and development expenses 
as a result  our initial sales of ampyra resulted in higher gross margins than if the inventory costs had not previously been expensed 
upon regulatory approval of ampyra  the company began capitalizing the commercial inventory costs associated with manufacturing with elan and at its second manufacturer  patheon 
the cost of ampyra inventory manufactured by elan is based on specified prices calculated as a percentage of net product sales of the product shipped by elan to acorda 
in the event elan does not manufacture the products  elan is entitled to a compensating payment for the quantities of product provided by the alternative manufacturer 
this compensating payment is included in our inventory balances 

table of contents cost of sales ampyra cost of sales consists of cost of inventory  expense due to inventory reserves when necessary  royalty expense  milestone amortization of intangible assets associated with the company s agreement with elan and well as the capitalization of a milestone achievement with the canadian spinal research organization csro during the three months ended march   packaging costs  freight and required inventory stability testing costs 
the company s inventory costs  royalty obligations and milestone obligations are set forth in the agreements entered into with elan 
these agreements require us to pay elan a percentage of our net selling price for each inventory lot purchased from elan 
the cost for each lot is calculated based on an agreed upon estimated net selling price which is based on an actual net selling price pertaining to a prior quarter 
at the end of each quarter  the company performs a calculation to adjust the inventory value for any lots received in the current quarter to that quarter s actual net selling price 
this payment is recorded as an adjustment to inventory as well as an accrual on the company s balance sheet and is required to be paid within days of the quarter end 
in the event the company has sold any inventory purchased from elan during that respective quarter  the company would also record an adjustment to the cost of goods sold and an additional accrual on the balance sheet to be paid to elan 
the agreement with elan allows the company to purchase up to of its annual inventory requirements from an alternative manufacturer but stipulates a compensating payment to be made to elan for any inventory purchased from this alternative manufacturer 
this payment is determined at the end of the quarter in which any new lots have been purchased exclusive from elan using the actual net selling price for the respective quarter net of an agreed upon amount as stipulated by the elan agreement 
this payment recorded as an adjustment to inventory as well as an accrual on the company s balance sheet 
zanaflex cost of sales consists of cost of inventory  expense due to inventory reserves when necessary  royalty expense  milestone amortization of intangible assets associated with the zanaflex acquisition  packaging costs  freight and required inventory stability testing costs 
our inventory costs  royalty obligations and milestone obligations are set forth in the agreements entered into in connection with our zanaflex acquisition 
any payments we make to prf in connection with the revenue interest assignment transaction entered into in december will not constitute royalty expense or otherwise affect our cost of sales 
see liquidity and capital resources financing arrangements 
research and development research and development expenses include the costs associated with our internal research and development activities including  employee compensation and benefits  occupancy costs  and research and development conducted for us by third parties  such as sponsored university based research  clinical trial vendors  contract manufacturing for our preclinical program  costs of materials used in clinical trials  depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products and regulatory consulting to support our products 
in addition  research and development expenses include expenses related to grant revenue and the cost of clinical trial drug supply shipped to our clinical study vendors 
we account for our clinical study costs by estimating the patient cost per visit in each clinical trial and recognizing this cost as visits occur  beginning when the patient enrolls in the trial 
this estimated cost includes payments to the trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial 
cost per patient varies based on the type of clinical trial  the site of the clinical trial  and the length of the treatment period for each patient 
as actual costs become known to us  we adjust our accrual  such changes in estimate may be a material change in our clinical study accrual  which could also materially affect our results of operations 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred except when we are accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
in these cases  these payments are capitalized at the time of payment and expensed ratable over the period the research and development activity is performed 

table of contents our drug development programs currently are at an early stage 
ggf is in a phase clinical trial  rhigm is in preclinical development  and the other programs are still in the research phase 
we consider the active management and development of our research  preclinical and clinical pipeline an important component of the long term process of introducing new products 
we manage our overall research  development and in licensing efforts in a highly disciplined manner designed to advance only high quality  differentiated agents into clinical development 
the duration of each phase of research and preclinical and clinical development and the probabilities of success for approval of drug candidates entering clinical development will be impacted by a variety of factors  including the quality of the molecule  the validity of the target and disease indication  early clinical data  investment in the program  competition and commercial viability 
due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and the early stage nature of our pipeline development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty completion dates  the proportion of our r d investments assigned to any one program or to the future cash inflows from these potential programs 
for additional discussion regarding the risks and uncertainties regarding our development programs  please refer to the risk factors section  particularly the risk factors entitled our drug development programs are in early stages of development and may never be commercialized 
our drug products in development products must undergo rigorous clinical testing  the results of which are uncertain and could substantially delay or prevent us from bringing them to market 
if third party contract research organizations do not perform in an acceptable and timely manner  our preclinical testing or clinical trials could be delayed or unsuccessful 
the pharmaceutical industry is subject to stringent regulation and failure to obtain regulatory approval will prevent commercialization of our product candidates and  if we do not comply with fda regulations if we obtain regulatory approval  approved products could be withdrawn from the market 
if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective  safer  more economical in use or more convenient than our approved products  or obtain marketing approval before we obtain approval of future products  our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated

under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end  based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 

table of contents we did not record any tax provision or benefit for the year ended december  we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our gross deferred tax assets since realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards cannot be sufficiently assured at december  as of december   we had available federal net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million which may be available to offset future taxable income  if any 
the federal losses are expected to expire between and while the state losses are expected to expire between and we also have research and development tax credit carry forwards of approximately million for federal income tax reporting purposes which are available to reduce federal income taxes  if any  through since our inception  we have incurred substantial losses and may incur substantial and recurring losses in future periods 
the internal revenue code of  as amended  the code  provides for a limitation of the annual use of net operating loss and research and development tax credit carry forwards following certain ownership changes  as defined by the code that could significantly limit our ability to utilize these carry forwards 
we have experienced various ownership changes  as defined by the code  as a result of past financings 
accordingly  our ability to utilize the aforementioned carry forwards may be limited 
additionally  because us tax laws limit the time during which these carry forwards may be applied against future taxes we may not be able to take full advantage of these attributes for federal income tax purposes 
share based compensation we account for stock options and restricted stock granted to employees and non employees by recognizing the costs resulting from all share based payment transactions in the financial statements at their fair values 
we estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant using the black scholes closed form option pricing model based on assumptions for the expected term of the stock options  expected volatility of our common stock  prevailing interest rates  and an estimated forfeiture rate 
we have based our current assumptions on the following assumption method of estimating estimated expected term of options based on the th percentile of our peer companies expected volatility combination of historic volatility of our common stock since october  and the historic volatility of the stock of our peer companies risk free interest rate yields of us treasury securities corresponding with the expected life of option grants forfeiture rates historical forfeiture data of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of the employees and expected performance of our common stock 
increases in the term and the volatility of our common stock will generally cause an increase in compensation expense 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  grants receivable  convertible notes payable  accounts payable  and put call liability 
the estimated fair values of all of our financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts at december  we have cash equivalents and short term investments at december   which are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and our interest income fluctuates as our interest rates change 
due to the short term nature of our investments in money market funds and us treasury bonds  the carrying value of our cash equivalents and short term investments approximate their fair value at december  at december   we held million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments which had an average interest rate of approximately 
we maintain an investment portfolio in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  interest rate risk is mitigated 
we do not own derivative financial instruments 
accordingly  we do not believe that there is any material market risk exposure with respect to derivative or other financial instruments
