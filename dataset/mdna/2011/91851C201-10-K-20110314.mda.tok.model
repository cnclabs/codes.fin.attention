item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the company s results of operations are dependent upon the difference between prices received for its oil and gas production and the costs to find and produce such oil and gas 
oil and gas prices have been and are expected in the future to be volatile and subject to fluctuations based on a number of factors beyond the control of the company 
the company operates the etame  avouma  south tchibala and ebouri fields on behalf of a consortium of five companies offshore of the republic of gabon 
production commenced from the etame field in and was subsequently expanded through additional development wells in and in  the company developed the avouma and south tchibala fields by setting a platform and tying the field back to the fpso via a pipeline 
oil production commenced from the avouma and south tchibala fields in january oil production began in january from the ebouri field utilizing a platform that was installed in august and connected to the fpso by pipeline 
critical accounting policies the following describes the critical accounting policies used by the company in reporting its financial condition and results of operations 
in some cases  accounting standards allow more than one alternative accounting method for reporting  such is the case with accounting for oil and gas activities described below 
in those cases  the company s reported results of operations would be different should it employ an alternative accounting method 
successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas activities the sec prescribes in regulation s x the financial accounting and reporting standards for companies engaged in oil and gas producing activities 
two methods are prescribed the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
like many other oil and gas companies  the company has chosen to follow the successful efforts method 
management believes that this method is preferable  as the company has focused on exploration activities wherein there is risk associated with future success and as such earnings are best represented by attachment to the drilling operations of the company 
costs of successful wells  development dry holes and leases containing productive reserves are capitalized and amortized on a unit of production basis over the life of the related reserves 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical expenses applicable to undeveloped leasehold  leasehold expiration costs and delay rentals are expensed as incurred 
in accordance with successful efforts method of accounting  the company reviews proved oil and gas properties for indications of impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its oil and gas properties may not be recoverable 
when it is determined that an oil and gas property s estimated future net cash flows will not be sufficient to recover its carrying amount  an impairment charge must be recorded to reduce the carrying amount of the asset to its estimated fair value 
this may occur if a field contains lower than anticipated reserves or if commodity prices fall below a level that significantly effects anticipated future cash flows on the field 
impairment of unproved property the company evaluates its unproved properties for impairment on a property by property basis 
the majority of the company s unproved property consists of acquisition costs related to its undeveloped acreage in angola 
on at least a quarterly basis  management reviews the unproved property for indicators of impairment based on the company s current exploration plans with consideration given to results of any drilling and seismic activity during the period and known information regarding exploration activity by other companies on adjacent blocks 
see item properties and note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the

index to financial statements company s exploration plans in angola 
any adverse developments related to the company s ability to further extend the drilling obligation date  if necessary  could result in an impairment of the company s unproved properties and other assets with a carrying value of approximately million as well as the loss of the funds the company has escrowed to secure its drilling obligations of million 
capital resources and liquidity cash flows net cash provided by operating activities for was million  as compared to million in and million in the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to net income of million in versus a net loss of million in the decrease in cash provided by operations in versus was primarily due to a net loss incurred in versus net income in and less favorable changes in operating assets and liabilities

capital expenditures during  the company invested million in property and equipment additions including amounts carried in accounts payable and excluding exploration dry hole costs  primarily associated with the drilling of three development wells in the etame marin block offshore gabon totaling million 
in addition  one successful exploration well was drilled in the southeast etame area of the etame marin block at a cost of million  and the company invested in a granite wash formation lease in texas million and a second extension of the mutamba iroru block onshore gabon million 
during  the company invested million in property and equipment additions primarily associated with the drilling of the three wells in the ebouri field the appraisal well plus the two development wells drilled from the ebouri platform totaling million 
additionally  the company s share of the leasehold bonus associated with the etame marin block exploration period extension totaled million 
partially offsetting these additions was a realignment agreement with a joint venture partner that originally did not participate in an appraisal well and one of the development wells in the ebouri field 
pursuant to the realignment agreement  the joint venture partner paid its proportionate share of capital expenditures for the wells  which reduced the company s property and equipment by million

historically  the company s primary sources of capital resources has been from cash flows from operations  private sales of equity  borrowings and purchase money debt 
on december   the company had cash balances of million and funds in escrow of million 
the company believes that these cash balances combined with cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund the company s capital expenditure budget  which is expected to range from to million to further develop the etame marin block and for drilling in angola and the granite wash lease in texas 
the company invests cash not required for immediate operational and capital expenditure needs in short term bankers acceptance and money market instruments primarily with jpmorgan chase co 
the company does not invest in asset backed commercial paper market which has been subject to a liquidity crisis over the last few years 
as operator of the etame  avouma  south tchibala and ebouri fields  the company enters into project related activities on behalf of its working interest partners 
the company generally obtains advances from its partners prior to significant funding commitments 
contractual obligations the table below summarizes the company s net share of obligations and commitments at december  payment period in thousands thereafter total operating leases the company is guarantor of a lease for the fpso utilized in gabon  which has remaining obligations of million 
the company s share of these payments is included in the table above 
the company can cancel the lease anytime after september   with months prior notice 
approximately of the payment is co guaranteed by the company s partners in gabon 
in addition to the fpso amounts  the schedule includes the company s share of its other lease obligations 
in addition to the contractual obligations described above  the company entered into a sixth exploration period extension during and is required to spend million for its share of two exploration wells and acquire process square kilometers of d seismic on the etame marin block by july one of the two exploration commitment wells was drilled in on the omangou prospect at a cost of million million net to the company 
the company also entered into the second exploration period for the mutamba iroru block which requires the company to reprocess kilometers of d seismic and drill one exploration well by may in addition  the company is required to spend million for its share of two exploration wells on block in angola by november  the government assigned working interest partner was delinquent paying their share of the costs several times in and consequently was placed in a default position which impacted the timing for drilling the two commitment wells 
in early  the company began working with the government of angola regarding a time extension for the drilling of the wells beyond the november expiration date and to obtain a replacement partner 
by governmental decree dated december   the 
table of contents 
index to financial statements former partner was removed from the production sharing contract and a one year time extension was granted 
the company and the government of angola then agreed on the process for obtaining a replacement partner 
the company opened a data room in houston which is expected to close in the second quarter of information related to interested parties will then be provided to the government of angola for selection and finalization 
if necessary  the government of angola has expressed willingness to consider a further time extension once the new partner has been selected and a timeline of the drilling plans is completed 
while we believe that the government of angola will grant us another extension if necessary  we can provide no assurances that such an extension will be granted 
if the government of angola were to deny a time extension  and the wells are not drilling by the end of november  the company risks forfeiture of its million funds in escrow and the company may be required to impair its leasehold costs and other investments with a carrying value of million as of december  the company is carrying million of asset retirement obligations as of december   representing the present value of these obligations as of that date 
the company does not anticipate incurring expenditures for any material asset retirement obligations over the next five years 
results of operations year ended december  compared to years ended december  and revenues total oil and gas sales for were million as compared to million and million for and  respectively

in  the company sold approximately  net bbls at an average price of per bbl from the etame field in gabon with revenues from the united states of million 
crude oil sales from the etame marin block are a function of the number and size of crude oil liftings from the fpso and thus crude oil sales do not always coincide with oil volumes produced 
operating costs and expenses production expense for was million as compared to million and million for and  respectively 
in the aggregate  production expenses in were nearly the same as in in  despite lower sales volumes which reduced production expenses  increased expense resulted from the ebouri well workover million 
production expenses were higher in versus primarily due to higher sales volumes  and higher fpso costs 
the company matches production expenses with crude oil sales 
any production expenses associated with unsold crude oil inventory are capitalized 
exploration expense for was million as compared to million and million for and  respectively 
in  exploration expense is primarily comprised of million for the omangou unsuccessful exploration well offshore gabon  million for seismic costs in the etame marin block offshore gabon  onshore gabon exploration expense of million  and million in angola primarily for geotechnical studies 
in  the company spent million on four unsuccessful exploration wells including the north etame prospect offshore gabon million  two wells on the mutamba iroru block onshore gabon million and a well on block c in the british north sea million

additionally  the company spent million for acquiring square kilometers of d seismic in angola in also included in exploration expenses in were aeromagnetic gravity data acquired over the mutamba iroru block  seismic acquisition and processing costs associated with the company s etame marin block and seismic processing costs in angola 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million for  and was million and million for and  respectively 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense decreased slightly in versus due to lower sales volumes partially offset by overall higher depletion rates 
the depletion rates for the ebouri field averaged per bbl  avouma and south tchibala fields averaged per bbl  and the etame field averaged per bbl 
in comparison  the depletion rates for the ebouri field averaged per bbl  avouma and south tchibala fields averaged per bbl  and the etame field averaged per bbl 
the increase in versus was primarily due to higher production volumes 
general and administrative expense for was million as compared to million and million for and  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expense for versus was primarily due to million of increased overhead reimbursement associated with the extensive drilling program in offshore gabon and a decrease in retirement benefits of million 
general and administrative expense decreased in versus due in part to non recurring legal and solicitation costs associated with corporate matters relating to the company s annual meeting 
during  the company incurred million of stock based compensation compared to million incurred in and incurred in in each of the three years  the company benefited from overhead reimbursement associated with production and development operations on the etame marin block 
other operating income for was million 
for and  no amounts were recorded for other operating income 
the other operating income recorded in was attributable to receipt of proceeds from a joint venture partner that originally elected to not participate in two wells drilled in the ebouri field  offshore gabon 
the partner later elected to participate and paid for their proportionate share of the capital expenditures for the wells 
the million payment received represents the company s share of an agreed risk premium benefiting the joint venture partners that originally participated in those two wells 
operating income operating income for was million as compared to a million and million for and  respectively 
the significant increase in operating income in versus was primarily attributable to the higher average crude sales price of per bbl  an increase of per bbl  and a year to year decrease in exploration expense totaling million 
the decrease in exploration expense reflects less dry hole expense incurred in versus the significant decrease in operating income in versus was primarily attributable to the lower average crude sales price of per bbl  a decrease of per bbl compared to the sales price  and higher exploration costs related to unsuccessful exploratory wells 
also  partially contributing to the decrease in operating income were higher operating expenses and depletion expense 
other income expense interest income for was million compared to million and million in and  respectively 
all the   and amounts represent interest earned and accrued on cash balances and funds in escrow 
extremely low interest rates in account for the decrease in interest income 
no interest expense was recorded in interest expense of million was recorded in as compared to million in interest in both years was associated with the financings from the ifc for use on etame marin block activities 
the increase in interest expense in compared to is attributable to a decrease in the amount of loan interest that could be capitalized

index to financial statements other expense for was million compared to million in other expense was negligible in the other expense in both and was primarily associated with foreign exchange losses 
income taxes in  the company incurred million of income taxes compared to million incurred in which were associated with the etame marin block production  and which were incurred in gabon 
in  the company incurred million of income taxes associated with the etame marin block production  which were incurred in gabon 
the slightly lower income taxes incurred in versus was a function of lower sales quantities largely offset by higher crude oil sales prices 
the decreased tax in gabon in versus was due to lower crude oil sales prices in  which was partially offset by higher sales quantities 
also a larger percentage of crude was subject to taxation in as part of profit oil versus cost oil 
net income loss net income for was million compared to a net loss in of million 
net income in was million 
the increase in net income in versus is attributable to the increased crude oil sales prices and lesser unsuccessful exploration well costs incurred in the decrease in versus was attributable primarily to the unsuccessful exploration well costs incurred and lower crude oil sales prices

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company s major market risk exposure continues to be the prices applicable to its oil and gas production 
sales prices are primarily driven by the prevailing market price 
historically  prices received for oil and gas production have been volatile and unpredictable 
foreign exchange risk our results of operations and financial condition are affected by currency exchange rates 
while oil sales are denominated in us dollars  portions of our operating costs in gabon are denominated in the local currency 
a weakening us dollar will have the effect of increasing operating costs while a strengthening us dollar will have the effect of reducing operating costs 
the gabon local currency is tied to the euro 
the exchange rate between the euro and the us dollar has fluctuated widely in response to international political conditions  general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
interest rate risk at december  the company did not have any debt and thus no exposure to interest rate risk on debt 
interest earned on cash investments is immaterial 
commodity price risk the company had no derivatives in place as of the date of this report  or throughout  or
