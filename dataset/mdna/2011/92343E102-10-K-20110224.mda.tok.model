overview we are a provider of internet infrastructure services 
by leveraging our global infrastructure  we provide network confidence and availability for mission critical internet services  such as domain name registry services and infrastructure assurance services 
our service capabilities enable domain name registration through our registrar partners and provide network availability for registrars and internet users alike 
as a result of the sale of the authentication services business  included in the former internet  infrastructure and identity services segment  ceasing operations of the cps business and the divestiture of legacy products and services  comprising the former other services segment  our only reportable segment is now naming services  which consists of registry services and nia services 
registry services operates the authoritative directory of all 
com  
net  
cc  
tv  and 
name domain names and the back end systems for all 
jobs and 
edu domain names 
as of december   we had approximately million domain names registered under the 
com and 
net registries  our principal registries 
the number of domain names registered is largely driven by internet usage and broadband penetration rates  as well as advertising and marketing activities carried out by us and third party registrars 
although growth in absolute number of registrations remains greatest in mature markets such as the us  growth on an annual percentage basis is expected to be greatest in markets outside of the us over the long term 
nia services provides infrastructure assurance to organizations and is comprised of verisign idefense security intelligence services  managed domain name system services  and distributed denial of service mitigation 
revenues from nia services are not significant 
business highlights and trends we recorded revenues of million  an increase of  as compared to the increase was primarily due to a year over year increase in active domain names ending in

we realized a million gain due to distributions received in excess of book value 
in  we purchased marketable securities of million and sold marketable securities of million 
we generated cash flows from operating activities of million  a decrease of as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the payment of contingent interest related to the convertible debentures and higher income taxes payable  primarily upon the gain resulting from the sale of the authentication services business  before consideration of carried forward excess tax benefits from exercises of stock options and other employee stock purchases 
divestiture transactions during the fourth quarter of  we announced a change to our business strategy to allow management to focus its attention on our core competencies and to make additional resources available to invest in our core businesses 
the strategy called for the divestiture or winding down of our non core businesses 
the divestiture strategy is now complete with the wind down of our cps business

critical accounting policies and significant management estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates those estimates 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies have the most significant impact on our judgment and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we generate revenues by providing services over a period of time 
fees for these services are deferred and recognized as performance occurs 
the majority of our revenue transactions contain standard business terms and conditions 
however  at times  we enter into non standard arrangements including multiple element arrangements 
as a result  judgments are used to evaluate whether an arrangement exists  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among potential multiple elements  when to recognize revenue on the deliverables  and whether all elements of the arrangement have been delivered 
our revenue recognition policy also requires an assessment as to whether collection is reasonably assured  which requires us to evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers 
valuation of goodwill and other long lived assets goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of net assets of businesses acquired 
fair value determination of acquired net assets  especially intangible assets  requires us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgment 
these estimates are based upon a number of factors  including historical experience  
table of contents market conditions and information obtained from the management of the acquired company 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include  but are not limited to  historical and projected customer retention rates  anticipated growth in revenue from the acquired customer and product base and the expected use of the acquired assets 
these factors are also considered in determining the useful life of the acquired intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination that are determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually or between annual tests in the presence of impairment indicators such as a a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  b an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  c unanticipated competition  d loss of key personnel  e a more likely than not expectation of sale or disposal of a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof  f testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  or g recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 
judgment is required in determining the existence of these factors and their effect on any impairment determination 
the fair value of our reporting units is determined considering the income  the market or the transaction valuation approaches or a combination thereof 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that the reporting unit is expected to generate over its remaining life 
under the market approach  the value of the reporting unit is based on an analysis that compares the value of the reporting unit to values of publicly traded companies in similar lines of business 
the transaction approach is a valuation technique that estimates the fair value of the reporting unit based on market prices on actual transactions and asking prices for businesses currently available for sale 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
in estimating the fair value of our reporting units for the purposes of our annual or interim analyses  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows  operating trends  discount rates  control premiums  and other variables of these businesses 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the cash flows attributable to these businesses over their estimated remaining useful lives 
we also consider our market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis 
given the significant excess of fair value over our reporting units carrying value  the goodwill valuations were not overly sensitive to valuation methodologies or assumptions 
further  a hypothetical change of in the fair value of our reporting units would not have resulted in goodwill impairments as of december  our other long lived assets consist primarily of property and equipment and purchased intangible assets 
we review other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we will not be able to recover the asset s carrying amount 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the fair value of the underlying business or asset  a significant decrease in the benefits realized from the acquired business  difficulty and delays in integrating the business or a significant change in the operations of the acquired business or use of an asset 
recoverability of other long lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted cash flows of the group containing the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
restructuring charges we have initiated restructuring plans including workforce reductions  involving employee severance benefits  and abandonment of excess facilities 
accounting for severance costs requires identifying whether the costs are associated with an ongoing arrangement or are considered a one time benefit 
severance costs associated with an ongoing arrangement are recorded once the costs are determined to be both probable and 
table of contents estimable 
severance costs that are considered a one time benefit are measured at fair value and are recognized upfront or over the future service period  depending on whether future service is required  if certain conditions are met  including i management s commitment to a detailed plan of termination that identifies the number of employees  their job classifications or functions and their locations  and expected completion date  and ii the plan has been communicated to the employees 
determining the appropriate accounting model to use and estimating the fair value and the future service period requires judgment and could differ materially from actual experience and would require us to change our estimates  as necessary  with cumulative catch up adjustments in the period of change 
excess facilities restructuring charges take into account the fair value of the future lease obligations of the abandoned space  including the potential for sublease income 
estimating the amount of sublease income requires management to make estimates for the space that will be rented  the rate per square foot that might be received and the vacancy period of each property 
these estimates could differ materially from actual amounts due to changes in the real estate markets in which the properties are located  such as the supply of office space and prevailing lease rates 
changing market conditions by location and considerable work with third party leasing companies require us to periodically review each lease and change our estimates on a prospective basis  as necessary 
fair value of financial instruments our convertible debentures have a contingent interest payment provision  that is identified as an embedded derivative  to be accounted for separately at fair value  and is marked to market at the end of each reporting period 
we utilize a valuation model based on simulations of stock prices  interest rates  credit ratings and bond prices to estimate the value of the derivative 
the significant inputs to the model include risk adjusted interest rates  volatility and average yield curve observations and stock price 
several significant inputs to the model are not observable and require management judgment 
stock based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares which contain a service and or performance condition 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a few complex and subjective variables  primarily  expected stock price volatility and expected term of the awards 
expected volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the expected term of the options and the mean historical implied volatility from traded options 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and or cancellations 
we are also required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant for restricted stock units  stock options and employee stock purchase plan offerings and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we use the monte carlo simulation option pricing model to determine the fair value of awards with market conditions 
the monte carlo simulation option pricing model takes into account the same input assumptions as the black scholes model  however  it also further incorporates into the fair value determination the possibility that the market condition may not be satisfied 
if factors change and as a result we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  the stock based compensation expense we record for such future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our results of operations 

table of contents litigation and contingencies accruals for loss contingencies are based on management s judgment as to the amount of loss to be incurred 
an accrual can be recorded when the event causing the loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
these accruals are based largely on estimates that require significant judgment  which could differ from actual results  thereby requiring us to record additional accruals or reverse a portion of such accruals 
income taxes accounting for income taxes requires significant judgments in the development of estimates used in income tax calculations 
such judgments include  but are not limited to  the likelihood we would realize the benefits of net operating loss carryforwards  domestic and or foreign tax credit carryforwards  the adequacy of valuation allowances  and the rates used to measure transactions with foreign subsidiaries 
to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely  we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
our operations involve dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
the final taxes payable are dependent upon many factors  including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from us federal  state  and international tax audits 
we only recognize or continue to only recognize tax positions that meet a more likely than not threshold 
we adjust these amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  however  due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
deferred income taxes have not been provided on the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries because these earnings have been indefinitely reinvested and we do not plan to initiate any action that would precipitate the payment of income taxes thereon 
we consider the following matters  among others  in evaluating our plans for indefinite reinvestment the forecasts  budgets and financial requirements of the parent and subsidiaries for both the long and short term  the tax consequences of a decision to reinvest  and any us and foreign government programs designed to influence remittances 
if factors change and as a result we are unable to indefinitely reinvest the foreign earnings  the income tax expense and payments may differ significantly from the current period and could materially adversely affect our results of operations

stock options and restricted stock units grants of stock options and or restricted stock units are key components of the compensation packages we provide to attract and retain certain of our talented employees and align their interests with the interests of existing stockholders 
we recognize that options and restricted stock units dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options and restricted stock units granted while providing competitive compensation packages 
consistent with these dual goals  our cumulative potential dilution since has been a weighted average annualized rate of per year  calculated as the average annualized new options and restricted stock units granted  net of options and restricted stock units forfeited by employees during the calculation period for example  upon termination of employment  divided by the weighted average outstanding shares during the calculation period 
as of december   the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding options and restricted stock units  regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price  was 
this maximum potential dilution will only result if all outstanding options vest and are exercised and all restricted 
table of contents stock units vest and are settled 
as of december   of our outstanding options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price 
consistent with our historical practices  we do not expect that dilution from future grants of stock options and restricted stock units before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed per year for our ongoing business 
in recent years  our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option and restricted stock unit programs  however  we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for other purposes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and market risks 
we have not entered into any market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity we invest in a variety of securities  including money market funds  debt securities issued by the us treasury and other us government corporations and agencies  corporate debt securities  and debt securities issued by foreign governments 
the primary objective of our short term investment management activities is to preserve principal with the additional goals of maintaining appropriate liquidity and earning an after tax return commensurate with the risks associated in each portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio generally consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality 
we monitor our interest rate and credit risks  including our credit exposures to specific rating categories and to individual issuers 
we invest in investment grade marketable fixed income securities 

table of contents in general  money market funds are not considered to be subject to interest rate risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurance that we will be adequately protected against risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
at any time  a sharp change in interest rates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of our fixed income securities in our short term investment portfolio as of december   arising from potential changes in interest rates 
the modeling technique estimates the change in fair value from immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps  and bps 
valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points fair value as of december  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps in thousands fixed income securities foreign exchange risk management we conduct business throughout the world and transact in multiple foreign currencies 
our foreign currency risk management program is designed to mitigate foreign exchange risks associated with the monetary and non monetary assets and liabilities of our operations that are denominated in non functional currencies 
the primary objective of this program is to minimize the gains and losses to income resulting from fluctuations in exchange rates 
we may choose not to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures due to immateriality  prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures  and limited availability of appropriate hedging instruments 
we do not enter into foreign currency transactions for trading or speculative purposes  nor do we hedge foreign currency exposures in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in exchange rates 
the program may entail the use of forward or option contracts and in each case these contracts are limited to a duration of less than months 
our foreign currency forward contracts are usually placed and adjusted monthly 
these foreign currency forward contracts are derivatives and are recorded at fair market value 
we attempt to limit our exposure to credit risk by executing foreign exchange contracts with financial institutions that have investment grade ratings 
as of december   we held foreign currency forward contracts in notional amounts totaling million to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations associated with certain foreign currencies 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currency derivatives outstanding would result in a decrease increase in income of approximately million 
however  this would be largely offset by the remeasurement of our foreign currency denominated monetary and non monetary assets and liabilities resulting in an insignificant net impact to income 
a hypothetical uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which our revenues and expenses are denominated would not result in a significant impact to our financial statements 
there are inherent limitations in the sensitivity analysis presented  due primarily to the assumption that foreign exchange rate movements are linear and instantaneous 
as a result  the analysis is unable to reflect the potential effects of more complex market changes that could arise  which may positively or negatively affect income 

table of contents market risk management the fair market value of our convertible debentures is subject to interest rate risk and market risk due to the convertible feature of the debentures 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
the fair market value of the convertible debentures will also increase as the market price of our stock increases and decrease as the market price of our common stock falls 
the interest and market value changes affect the fair market value of the convertible debentures but do not impact our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
as of december   the fair value of the convertible debentures was approximately billion  based on quoted market prices 
the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative on convertible debentures is also subject to interest rate risk and market risk 
generally  the fair market value of the contingent interest derivative will change due to changes in interest rates as well as due to changes in the fair market value of the convertible debentures
