item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general new york mortgage trust  inc  together with its consolidated subsidiaries nymt  the company  we  our and us  is a real estate investment trust  or reit  in the business of acquiring  investing in  financing and managing primarily mortgage related assets 
our principal business objective is to generate net income for distribution to our stockholders resulting from the spread between the interest and other income we earn on our interest earning assets and the interest expense we pay on the borrowings that we use to finance our leveraged assets and our operating costs  which we refer to as our net interest income 
we intend to achieve this objective by investing in a broad class of mortgage related and financial assets that in aggregate will generate what we believe are attractive risk adjusted total returns for our stockholders 
our targeted assets currently include agency rmbs consisting of pass through certificates  cmos  remics  ios and pos  non agency rmbs  which may include non agency ios and pos  prime arm loans held in securitization trusts  cmbs  commercial mortgage loans and other commercial real estate related debt investments 
we also may opportunistically acquire and manage various other types of mortgage related and financial assets that we believe will compensate us appropriately for the risks associated with them 
prior to  our investment portfolio was primarily comprised of agency rmbs  certain non agency rmbs originally rated in the highest rating category by two rating agencies and prime arm loans held in securitization trusts 
in early  we commenced a repositioning of our investment portfolio to transition the portfolio from one primarily focused on leveraged agency rmbs and prime arm loans held in securitization trusts  which primarily involve interest rate risk  to a more diversified portfolio that includes elements of credit risk with reduced leverage 
during  we continued to diversify our investment portfolio by opportunistically disposing of approximately million of agency rmbs and non agency rmbs  while investing approximately million in a limited partnership formed to invest in and manage a pool of performing whole residential mortgage loans  and approximately million of other mortgage related investments 
we intend to accelerate our portfolio diversification strategy in through the formation and funding of our recently announced midway residential mortgage portfolio 
this portfolio will be externally managed by the midway group  lp we have initially provided million to the midway residential mortgage portfolio and we anticipate contributing additional capital to this investment in the future  such that this investment will become a significant contributor to our revenues and earnings and will represent a significant portion of our total assets in the future 
for more information regarding the investment  financing and hedging strategies of this investment  see item business our residential mortgage portfolio strategy 
in addition  in line with our diversification strategy and our focus on asset performance  we have in the recent past pursued  and anticipate continuing to pursue in the future  investment opportunities in the commercial mortgage market 
we have elected to be taxed as a reit and have complied  and intend to continue to comply  with the provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended the internal revenue code  with respect thereto 
accordingly  we do not expect to be subject to federal income tax on our reit taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders if certain asset  income and ownership tests and recordkeeping requirements are fulfilled 
even if we maintain our qualification as a reit  we may be subject to some federal  state and local taxes on our income generated in our taxable reit subsidiary 
factors that affect our results of operations and financial condition our results of operations and financial condition are affected by various factors  including  among other things changes in interest rates  rates of prepayment  default and recovery on our assets or the mortgages or loans underlying such assets  general economic and financial and credit market conditions  our leverage  our access to funding and our borrowing costs  our hedging activities  changes in the credit ratings of the loans  securities  and other assets we own  the market value of our investments  liabilities related to our discontinued operation  including repurchase obligations on the sales of mortgage loans  actions taken by the us federal reserve and the us government  and requirements to maintain reit status and to qualify for an exemption from registration under the investment company act 
we earn income and generate cash through our investments 
our income is generated primarily from the net spread  which we refer to as net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income we earn on our investment portfolio and the cost of our borrowings and hedging activities and other operating costs  including management fees 
our net interest income will vary based upon  among other things  the difference between the interest rates earned on our interest earning assets and the borrowing costs of the liabilities used to finance those investments  prepayment speeds and default and recovery rates on the assets or the loans underlying such assets 
because changes in interest rates may significantly affect our activities  our operating results depend  in large part  upon our ability to manage interest rate risks and prepayment risks effectively while maintaining our status as a reit 
we anticipate that  for any period during which changes in the interest rates earned on our assets do not coincide with interest rate changes on our borrowings  such assets will reprice more slowly than the corresponding liabilities 
consequently  changes in interest rates  particularly short term interest rates  may significantly influence our net interest income 
with the maturities of our assets generally of longer duration than those of our liabilities  interest rate increases will tend to decrease the net interest income we derive from  and the market value of our interest rate sensitive assets and therefore our book value 
such rate increases could possibly result in operating losses or adversely affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
the yield on our assets may be affected by a difference between the actual prepayment rates and our projections 
prepayment rates  as reflected by the rate of principal paydown  and interest rates vary according to the type of investment  conditions in the economy and financial markets  competition and other factors  none of which can be predicted with any certainty 
to the extent we have acquired assets at a premium or discount to par  or face value  changes in prepayment rates may impact our anticipated yield 
in periods of declining interest rates  prepayments on our mortgage related assets will likely increase 
if we are unable to reinvest the proceeds of such prepayments at comparable yields  our net interest income will be negatively impacted 
the current climate of government intervention in the mortgage markets significantly increases the risk associated with prepayments 
while we historically have used  and intend to use in the future  hedging to mitigate some of our interest rate risk  we do not hedge all of our exposure to changes in interest rates and prepayment rates  as there are practical limitations on our ability to insulate our portfolio from all potential negative consequences associated with changes in short term interest rates in a manner that will allow us to seek attractive net spreads on our assets 
in addition  our returns will be affected by the credit performance of our more credit sensitive assets  such as non agency rmbs  equity investment in a pool of mortgage loans and clos 
these investments and other assets we intend to target under our midway residential mortgage portfolio strategy  as well as other assets we may acquire from time to time  expose us to credit risk 
to mitigate the credit risks associated with these assets  we may acquire more senior pieces of the capital structure  purchase the assets at discounted prices or hedge with credit sensitive derivative instruments 
nevertheless  if credit losses on our investments  loans  or the loans underlying our investments exceed our expectations or our ability to adequately hedge against these losses  it may have an adverse effect on our performance and our earnings 
as it relates to loans sold previously under certain loan sale agreements by our discontinued mortgage lending business  we may be required to repurchase some of those loans or indemnify the loan purchaser for damages caused by a breach of the loan sale agreement 
in the past  we have complied with the repurchase demands by repurchasing the loan with cash and reselling it at a loss  thus reducing our cash position 
more recently  we have addressed these requests by negotiating a net cash settlement based on the actual or assumed loss on the loan in lieu of repurchasing the loans 
as of december   the amount of repurchase requests outstanding was approximately million  against which we had a reserve of approximately million 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in settling the remaining repurchase demands on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to continue to resolve our current repurchase demands through negotiated net cash settlements  our liquidity could be adversely affected

current market conditions and commentary government actions 
in recent years  the residential housing  mortgage  credit and financial markets in the united states have experienced a variety of difficulties and changed economic conditions  including increased rates of loan defaults  significant credit losses and decreased liquidity 
currently  the us economy appears to be in a weak recovery with little or no broad inflationary pressures 
in response to these conditions  the us government  federal reserve  us treasury  federal deposit insurance corporation fdic and other governmental and regulatory bodies have taken significant actions to stabilize or improve market and economic conditions 
these actions include  among other things  the conservatorship of  and other programs involving  fannie mae and freddie mac  the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  the troubled asset relief program tarp  the capital purchase program cpp  the term asset backed securities loan facility talf  the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra  the homeowner affordability and stability plan hasp  the homeowner affordable modification program hamp and the hope for homeowners program 
while the impact from many of these programs has not been as extensive as initially anticipated  a number of these programs have impacted and may in the future continue to impact our portfolio and our results of operations 
in july  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act was passed by the us congress 
this legislation aims to restore responsibility and accountability to the financial system 
it is unclear how this legislation may impact the borrowing environment  investing environment for rmbs and other targeted assets  interest rate swaps and other derivatives as much of the legislation s implementation has not yet been defined by regulators 
in november  the us federal reserve announced a program to purchase an additional billion of longer term us treasury securities by the end of the second quarter of  a pace of about billion per month 
one of the effects of this program may be to increase the price of agency rmbs  which may also decrease our net interest margin 
once the program is terminated it may cause a decrease in demand for these securities  which likely would reduce their market price 
developments related to fannie mae and freddie mac 
payments on the agency rmbs in which we invest are guaranteed by fannie mae and freddie mac 
as broadly publicized  fannie mae and freddie mac have experienced significant losses in recent years  causing the us government to place fannie mae and freddie mac under federal conservatorship 
in february  the us department of the treasury along with the us department housing and urban development released a much awaited report titled reforming america s housing finance market  which outlines recommendations for reforming the us housing system  specifically the roles of fannie mae and freddie mac and transforming the government s involvement in the housing market 
it is unclear how future legislation may impact the housing finance market and the investing environment for mortgage related securities and more specifically  agency rmbs and non agency rmbs  as the method of reform is undecided and has not yet been defined by the regulators 
the scope and nature of the actions that the us government will ultimately undertake with respect to the future of fannie mae and freddie mac are unknown and will continue to evolve 
new regulations and programs related to fannie mae and freddie mac may adversely affect the pricing  supply  liquidity and value of rmbs and otherwise materially harm our business and operations 
a brief summary of certain other material developments involving fannie mae and freddie mac is set forth below the federal reserve s agency rmbs purchase program  which provided for purchases of up to trillion of agency rmbs  was completed on march  while the market expectation was that the termination of this purchase program would cause a decrease in demand for agency rmbs and  in turn  reduced market prices for agency rmbs  we continue to see strong demand and pricing for these securities 
in the event the us government decides to sell significant portions of its portfolio  then we may see meaningful price declines in agency rmbs 
during the first quarter of  fannie mae and freddie mac announced that they would execute wholesale repurchases of loans which they considered seriously delinquent from existing mortgage pools 
freddie mac implemented its purchase program in february with actual purchases beginning in march fannie mae began their process in march and announced it would implement the initial purchases over a period of four months  beginning in april further  both agencies announced that on an ongoing basis they would purchase loans from the pools of mortgage loans underlying their mortgage pass through certificates that became days delinquent 
the impact of these programs thus far is reflected in the constant prepayment rate  or cpr  of our portfolio 
these actions increased prepayments which decreased our income and book value in see balance sheet analysis prepayment experience below for further information 
during  there were indications that fannie mae and freddie mac  as well as certain bond insurers and large private investors  intended to pursue more aggressively in the future  repurchase demands for breaches of representation and warranties involved in the sale of loans now in default 
we could experience an increase in repurchase requests in the future if such large scale repurchase demands become prevalent 
mortgage and other asset values 
throughout  we continued to observe strong demand and high prices for agency rmbs 
market demand for non agency rmbs has steadily increased since early and throughout  with some recent flattening in terms of pricing 
we believe the steadily increasing prices were due to increased demand and the reduced market yields for agency rmbs 
we also expect market values for certain of our other targeted assets  such as cmbs  clos  and residential and commercial whole loans to improve as the economic outlook in the us and abroad improves 
credit quality 
us residential mortgage delinquency rates have continued to remain at high levels for various types of mortgage loans during the fourth quarter 
recent months have seen some stabilization or improvement of certain measures of credit quality  although this stabilization and or improvement may ultimately prove to be temporary 
while rmbs backed by subprime mortgages and option arms are experiencing the highest delinquency and loss rates  our portfolio of prime arm loans held in securitization trusts continue to experience high delinquency rates 
homeowner assistance programs such as hamp  as well as future legislative or regulatory actions  may affect the value of  and the returns on  our rmbs portfolio 
to the extent that these programs are successful and fewer borrowers default on their mortgage obligations  the actual default rates realized on our non agency rmbs may be less than the default assumptions made by us at the purchase of such non agency rmbs  which  in turn  could cause the realized yields on our non agency rmbs portfolio to be higher than previously expected 
conversely  any forced reductions in principal that emanate from such programs could cause a reduction in the market value of rmbs  particularly non agency rmbs 
financing markets and liquidity 
the liquidity facilities created by the federal reserve during and and its lowering of the federal funds target rate to have lowered our financing costs which most closely correlates with the day libor and stabilized the availability of repurchase agreement financing for agency rmbs 
the day libor  which was as of december   has remained relatively unchanged since december  the federal reserve has continued to reaffirm its plan to hold the fed funds rate near zero percent 
while we expect interest rates to rise over the longer term  we believe that interest rates  and thus our financing costs  are likely to remain at these historically low levels until such time as the economic data begin to confirm a sustainable improvement in the overall economy 
over the past year  many investment banks have resumed making term financing available for non agency rmbs 
the return of financing availability and the stabilization of borrowing costs have somewhat improved liquidity in the market for these securities  although such financing is currently available only in limited amounts and with respect to only certain types of those securities  so such improved liquidity is likely to be limited in the near term 
in addition to an improved financing environment for agency rmbs  the collateral requirements of our repurchase agreement lenders also improved throughout and  with the average haircut related to our repurchase agreement financing declining to approximately at december  as of december   the company had available cash of million to meet short term liquidity requirements 
prepayment rates 
as a result of various government initiatives  including hasp  hamp and the reduction in intermediate and longer term treasury yields  rates on conforming mortgages continue to be historically low 
while these trends have historically resulted in higher rates of refinancing and thus higher prepayment speeds  we have observed little impact from refinancing on the cpr for our portfolio 
however  and as discussed above  the cpr on our rmbs portfolio was negatively impacted during the year ended december   and in particular  during the three months ended june   by repurchase programs implemented by freddie mac and fannie mae as discussed above 
see balance sheet analysis prepayment experience below 
note regarding discontinued operation in connection with the sale of our wholesale and retail mortgage lending platform assets in  we classified our mortgage lending business as a discontinued operation 
as a result  we have reported revenues and expenses related to the mortgage lending business as a discontinued operation and the related assets and liabilities as assets and liabilities related to a discontinued operation for all periods presented in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
certain assets  such as the deferred tax asset  and certain liabilities  such as subordinated debt and liabilities related to leased facilities not assigned  are part of our ongoing operations and accordingly  have not been classified as a discontinued operation 
as of december  discontinued operations consist of million in assets  including million in loans held for sale  and million in liabilities  down from million in assets and million in liabilities at december   and are included in receivables and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets included in this annual report 
prior to march   we originated a wide range of residential mortgage loan products including prime  alternative a  and to a lesser extent sub prime loans  home equity lines of credit  second mortgages  and bridge loans 
our sale of the mortgage lending platform assets on march  marked our exit from the mortgage lending business 
the discontinued operations had net income of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company continues to wind down the discontinued operations and anticipates to be substantially complete by the end of financial condition as of december   we had approximately million of total assets  as compared to approximately million of total assets as of december  the decline in total assets is primarily a function of the repositioning of our investment portfolio away from a heavily weighted leveraged agency rmbs portfolio to a more diversified portfolio with reduced leverage

conversely  if prepayment expectations decrease  the premium would be amortized over a longer period resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
we monitor our prepayment experience on a monthly basis and adjust the amortization rate to reflect current market conditions 
mortgage loans held in securitization trusts 
included in our portfolio are arm loans that we originated or purchased in bulk from third parties that met our investment criteria and portfolio requirements and that we subsequently securitized 
the company has completed four securitizations  three were classified as financings and one  new york mortgage trust  qualified as a sale  which resulted in the recording of residual assets and mortgage servicing rights 
the company sold all the residual assets related to the securitization during the third quarter ended september   incurring a realized loss of approximately  at december   mortgage loans held in securitization trusts totaled approximately million  or of our total assets 
the company has a net equity investment of approximately million in the three securitization trusts at december  of the mortgage loans held in securitized trusts  are traditional arms or hybrid arms  of which are arm loans that are interest only 
on our hybrid arms  interest rate reset periods are predominately five years or less and the interest only period is typically years  which mitigates the payment shock at the time of interest rate reset

the restricted cash of million includes million held by counterparties as collateral for hedging instruments and million as collateral for a letter of credit related to the lease of the company s corporate headquarters 
financing arrangements  portfolio investments 
during the year ended december   we continued to employ a balanced and diverse funding mix to finance our assets 
as of december   our agency rmbs portfolio was funded with approximately million of repurchase agreement borrowings  which represents approximately of our total liabilities 
our repurchase agreements typically provide for terms of days 
as of december   the current weighted average borrowing rate on these financing facilities was 
for the year ended december   the ending balance  yearly average and maximum balance at any month end for our repurchase agreement borrowings were million  million and million  respectively 
collateralized debt obligations 
as of december   we had million of collateralized debt obligations  or cdos  outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
subordinated debentures 
as of december   our wholly owned subsidiary  hc  had trust preferred securities outstanding of million with a weighted average interest rate of 
the securities are fully guaranteed by us with respect to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation  redemption or repayment 
these securities are classified as subordinated debentures in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheet included in this annual report 
million of our subordinated debentures have a floating interest rate equal to three month libor plus  resetting quarterly  at december  these securities mature on march  and may be called at par by us any time after march  hc entered into an interest rate cap agreement to limit the maximum interest rate cost of these trust preferred securities to through march   at which point the interest rate cap expired 
million of our subordinated debentures had a fixed interest rate equal to up to and including july   at which point the interest rate converted to a floating rate equal to one month libor plus until maturity  at december  the securities mature on october  and may be called at par by us any time after october  convertible preferred debentures 
as of december   the million shares of our series a preferred stock issued in january matured  at which time we redeemed all outstanding shares at the per share liquidation preference plus the fourth quarter accrued dividends 
we funded this redemption from working capital 
the company recorded the dividend as interest expense because of the mandatory redemption feature 
we issued these shares of series a preferred stock to jmp group inc and certain of its affiliates for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the series a preferred stock entitled the holders to receive a minimum cumulative dividend of per year  subject to an increase to the extent any quarterly common stock dividends exceeded per share 
derivative assets and liabilities 
we generally hedge the risk related to changes in the benchmark interest rate used in the variable rate index  usually libor 
in order to reduce this risk  we enter into interest rate swap agreements whereby we receive floating rate payments in exchange for fixed rate payments  effectively converting our short term repurchase agreement borrowing or cdos to a fixed rate 
we also enter into interest rate cap agreements whereby  in exchange for a fee  we are reimbursed for interest paid in excess of a contractually specified capped rate 
derivative financial instruments contain credit risk to the extent that the institutional counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
we minimize this risk by limiting our counterparties to major financial institutions with good credit ratings 
in addition  we regularly monitor the potential risk of loss with any one party resulting from this type of credit risk 
accordingly  we do not expect any material losses as a result of default by other parties  but cannot guaranty we do not have counterparty failures 
we enter into derivative transactions solely for risk management purposes 
the decision of whether or not a given transaction  or a portion thereof  is hedged is made on a case by case basis  based on the risks involved and other factors as determined by senior management  including the financial impact on income and asset valuation and the restrictions imposed on reit hedging activities by the internal revenue code  among others 
in determining whether to hedge a risk  we may consider whether other assets  liabilities  firm commitments and anticipated transactions already offset or reduce the risk 
all transactions undertaken as a hedge are entered into with a view towards minimizing the potential for economic losses that could be incurred by us 
generally  all derivatives entered into are intended to qualify as cash flow hedges 
to this end  terms of the hedges are matched closely to the terms of hedged items 
the following table summarizes the estimated fair value of derivative assets and liabilities as of december  and december  dollar amounts in thousands december  december  derivative assets interest rate caps total derivative assets derivative liabilities interest rate swaps total derivative liabilities balance sheet analysis stockholders equity stockholders equity at december  was million and included million of net unrealized gains  million in unrealized derivative losses related to cash flow hedges and million in unrealized gains primarily related to our clos presented as accumulated other comprehensive income 
statement of operations analysis the following is a brief description of key terms from our statements of operations interest income and interest expense 
our primary source of income is net interest income on our portfolio of assets 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  which is the income that we earn on our assets  and interest expense  which is the expense we pay on our portfolio borrowings  subordinated debt and convertible preferred debentures 
other income expense 
other income expense includes loan losses for costs incurred with respect to the disposition of non performing or early payment default loans we have originated or purchased from third parties or from losses incurred on non performing loans held in securitization trusts 
in addition  other income expense includes net gains losses from the sale of investments securities or the early termination of interest rate swaps and income from our investment in a limited partnership 
general  administrative and other expenses 
expenses we incur in our business consist primarily of salary and employee benefits  fees payable to hcs pursuant to the advisory agreement  professional fees  insurance and other general and administrative expenses 
other general and administrative expenses include expenses for office rent  supplies and equipment  computer and software expenses  telephone  travel and entertainment and other miscellaneous operating expenses 
income from discontinued operation 
income from discontinued operations includes all revenues and expenses related to our discontinued mortgage lending business excluding those costs that will be retained by us 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and dollar amounts in thousands for the years ended december  change net interest income other income total expenses income for continuing operations income from discontinued operations net income basic income per common share diluted income per common share for the year ended december   we reported net income of million as compared to net income of million for the year ended december   which represents a million decrease 
the decrease in net income was due primarily to a million decrease in net interest margin on our investment portfolio and loans held in securitization trusts  a million increase in general  administrative and other expenses and a million increase in impairment on investments resulting from our investment in new bridger holdings llc  partially offset by a million increase in realized gain on securities  a million increase in income from an equity investment in a limited partnership and a million increase in income from discontinued operations 
the provision for loan losses also includes a million provision related to our investment in new bridger 
the decline in net interest margin for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to a million decrease in our average interest earning assets to approximately million for the year ended december   which was partially offset by a basis point increase in yield 
the general  administrative and other expenses increase of million for the year ended december  as compared to december  was due primarily to a million increase in management fees to hcs  million of which resulted from an increase in incentive management fees  which was due  in part  to the sale by the company in of certain non agency rmbs that were deemed managed assets under the prior advisory agreement and the performance of other managed assets  and partially offset by a million decrease in salaries and benefits and a million decrease in other expenses 
comparative net interest income our results of operations for our investment portfolio during a given period typically reflect the net interest spread earned on our investment portfolio of agency rmbs  non agency rbms  loans held in securitization trusts  loans held for investment and clos our interest earning assets 
the net interest spread is impacted by factors such as our cost of financing  the interest rate our investments are earning and our interest rate hedging strategies 
furthermore  the amount of premium or discount paid on purchased portfolio investments and the prepayment rates on portfolio investments will impact the net interest spread as such factors will be amortized over the expected term of such investments 
the following tables set forth the changes in net interest income  yields earned on our interest earning assets and rates on financial arrangements for the years ended december  and dollar amounts in thousands  except as noted for the years ended december  average balance amount yield rate average balance amount yield rate millions millions interest income interest earning assets amortization of net discount total interest expense investment securities and loans subordinated debentures convertible preferred debentures interest expense net interest income our average balance of interest earning assets is calculated each period as the daily average balance for the period of our interest earning assets  excluding unrealized gains and losses 
our average balance of interest bearing liabilities is calculated each period as the daily average balance for the period of our financing arrangements portfolio investments  cdos  subordinated debentures and convertible preferred debentures 
our net yield on interest earning assets is calculated by dividing our interest income from our interest earning assets for the period by our average interest earning assets during the same period 
our interest expense rate is calculated by dividing our interest expense from our interest bearing liabilities for the period by our average interest bearing liabilities

comparative net interest spread interest earning assets the following table sets forth  among other things  the net interest spread for our portfolio of interest earning assets by quarter for the eight most recently completed quarters  excluding the costs of our subordinated debentures and convertible preferred debentures 
quarter ended average interest earning assets millions weighted average coupon weighted average cash yield on interest earning assets cost of funds net interest spread constant prepayment rate cpr december  september  june  march  december  september  june  march  december  our average interest earning assets is calculated each quarter as the daily average balance of our interest earning assets for the quarter  excluding unrealized gains and losses 
the weighted average coupon reflects the weighted average rate of interest paid on our interest earning assets for the quarter  net of fees paid 
the percentages indicated in this column are the interest rates that will be effective through the interest rate reset date  where applicable  and have not been adjusted to reflect the purchase price we paid for the face amount of the security 
our weighted average cash yield on interest earning assets was calculated by dividing our annualized interest income from interest earning assets for the quarter by our average interest earning assets 
our cost of funds was calculated by dividing our annualized interest expense from our interest earning assets for the quarter by our average financing arrangements  portfolio investments and cdos 
net interest spread is the difference between our weighted average cash yield on interest earning assets and our cost of funds 
our constant prepayment rate  or cpr  is the proportion of principal of our pool of loans that were paid off during each quarter 
comparative net interest spread core interest earning assets  a non gaap financial measure net interest spread core interest earning assets represents a non gaap financial measure and is defined as gaap net interest spread plus unconsolidated investments in interest earning assets  such as our investment in limited partnership 
our investment in limited partnership represents our equity investment in a limited partnership that owns a pool of residential whole mortgage loans and from which we receive distributions equal to principal and interest payments and sales net of certain administrative expenses 
because the income we receive includes interest from the pool of mortgage loans  management considers the investment to be a functional equivalent to its interest earning assets under gaap 
in order to evaluate the effective net interest income of our investments  management uses net interest spread core interest earning assets to reflect the net interest spread of our investments as adjusted to reflect the addition of unconsolidated investments in interest earning assets 
management believes that net interest spread core interest earning assets provides useful information to investors as the income stream from this unconsolidated investment is similar to the net interest spread for the majority of our assets 
net interest spread core interest earning assets should not be considered a substitute for our gaap based calculation of net interest spread 
the following table reconciles our gaap net interest spread for our portfolio of interest earning assets for the three months ended december   to our non gaap measure of net interest spread core interest earning assets

comparative expenses dollar amounts in thousands for the year ended december  general  administrative and other expenses change salaries and benefits professional fees insurance management fees other total the increase in general  administrative and other expenses of million for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in management fees of million to hcs  million of which resulted from an increase in incentive management fees  which was due to the performance of assets managed under the advisory agreement 
the investments in these assets were originally acquired during the incentive fees were generated from realized gains from sales of non agency rmbs and excess interest returns from our clo and non agency rmbs investments 
discontinued operations dollar amount in thousands for the year ended december  change revenues net interest income loan losses other income net total net revenues expenses general and administrative total expenses income before income tax provision income tax provision income from discontinued operations net of tax off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not maintained any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
further  we have not guaranteed any obligations of unconsolidated entities nor do we have any commitment or intent to provide funding to any such entities 
accordingly  we are not materially exposed to any market  credit  liquidity or financing risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments  fund our operations  pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs 
we recognize the need to have funds available for our operating businesses and to meet these potential cash requirements 
our investments and assets generate liquidity on an ongoing basis through principal and interest payments  prepayments net earnings held prior to payment of dividends and distributions from unconsolidated investments 
in addition  depending on market conditions  the sale of investment securities or capital market transactions may provide additional liquidity 
we intend to meet our liquidity needs through normal operations with the goal of avoiding unplanned sales of assets or emergency borrowing of funds 
at december   we had cash balances of million  a receivable for securities sold of million  million in unencumbered securities  including million of rmbs  of which million are agency rmbs  and borrowings of million under outstanding repurchase agreements 
at december   we also had longer term debt  including cdos outstanding of million and subordinated debt of million 
the cdos are collateralized by the mortgage loans held in securitization trusts 
on december   we redeemed all outstanding shares of our series a preferred stock for an aggregate liquidation preference of million plus accrued dividends of million 
based on our current investment portfolio  new investment initiatives  leverage ratio and available borrowing arrangements  we believe our existing cash balances  funds available under our current repurchase agreements and cash flows from operations will meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
at december   our leverage ratio for our rmbs investment portfolio  which we define as our outstanding indebtedness under repurchase agreements divided by stockholders equity  was less than to we have continued to utilize significantly less leverage than our previously targeted leverage due to the ongoing repositioning of our investment portfolio to a more diversified portfolio that includes elements of credit risk with reduced leverage  as well as the greater than anticipated amount of time involved in identifying and redeploying capital to suitable new investment opportunities 
because financing for certain of the assets that introduce credit risk remains unfavorable  to date  we have used cash from operating activities to finance assets other than agency rmbs and prime arm loans held in securitization trusts 
as previously discussed above in item business  we recently formed our midway residential mortgage portfolio strategy 
as of february   we had provided the midway residential mortgage portfolio with an aggregate of million  and we anticipate contributing additional capital to this investment in the future 
moreover  we expect that the midway residential mortgage portfolio will utilize some leverage in building the midway residential mortgage portfolio 
we had outstanding repurchase agreements  a form of collateralized short term borrowing  with four different financial institutions as of december  these agreements are secured by certain of our agency rmbs and bear interest rates that have historically moved in close relationship to libor 
our borrowings under repurchase agreements are based on the fair value of our mortgage backed securities portfolio 
interest rate changes can have a negative impact on the valuation of these securities  reducing the amount we can borrow under these agreements 
moreover  our repurchase agreements allow the counterparties to determine a new market value of the collateral to reflect current market conditions and because these lines of financing are not committed  the counterparty can call the loan at any time 
if a counterparty determines that the value of the collateral has decreased  the counterparty may initiate a margin call and require us to either post additional collateral to cover such decrease or repay a portion of the outstanding borrowing  on minimal notice 
moreover  in the event an existing counterparty elected to not renew the outstanding balance at its maturity into a new repurchase agreement  we would be required to repay the outstanding balance with cash or proceeds received from a new counterparty or to surrender the mortgage backed securities that serve as collateral for the outstanding balance  or any combination thereof 
if we are unable to secure financing from a new counterparty and had to surrender the collateral  we would expect to incur a significant loss 
we enter into interest rate swap agreements as a mechanism to reduce the interest rate risk of the rmbs portfolio 
at december   we had million in notional interest rate swaps outstanding 
should market rates for similar term interest rate swaps drop below the fixed rates we have agreed to on our interest rate swaps  we will be required to post additional margin to the swap counterparty  reducing available liquidity 
at december   the company pledged million in cash margin to cover decreased valuations of interest rate swaps 
the weighted average maturity of the swaps was years at december  we also own approximately million of loans held for sale  which are included in discontinued operations 
our inability to sell these loans at all or on favorable terms could adversely affect our profitability as any sale for less than the current reserved balance would result in a loss 
currently  these loans are not financed or pledged 
as it relates to loans sold previously under certain loan sale agreements by our discontinued mortgage lending business  we may be required to repurchase some of those loans or indemnify the loan purchaser for damages caused by a breach of the loan sale agreement 
most recently  we have addressed these requests by negotiating a net cash settlement based on the actual or assumed loss on the loan in lieu of repurchasing the loans 
the company periodically receives repurchase requests  each of which management reviews to determine  based on management s experience  whether such request may reasonably be deemed to have merit 
as of december   we had a total of million of unresolved repurchase requests that management concluded may reasonably be deemed to have merit  against which we had a reserve of approximately million 
we paid quarterly cash dividends of   and per common share in january  april  july  and october  respectively 
on december   we declared a fourth quarter cash dividend of per common share 
the dividend was paid on january  to common stockholders of record as of december  on december   we paid a per share cash dividend  or approximately million in the aggregate  on shares of our series a preferred stock to holders of record as of december  we also paid a   and per share cash dividend on shares of our series a preferred stock in january  april  july  and october  respectively 
each of these dividends was paid out of the company s working capital 
we expect to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends on our common stock during the near term 
however  our board of directors will continue to evaluate our dividend policy each quarter and will make adjustments as necessary  based on a variety of factors  including  among other things  the need to maintain our reit status  our financial condition  liquidity  earnings projections and business prospects 
our dividend policy does not constitute an obligation to pay dividends  which only occurs when our board of directors declares a dividend 
we intend to make distributions to our stockholders to comply with the various requirements to maintain our reit status and to minimize or avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
however  differences in timing between the recognition of reit taxable income and the actual receipt of cash could require us to sell assets or to borrow funds on a short term basis to meet the reit distribution requirements and to avoid corporate income tax and the nondeductible excise tax 
inflation for the periods presented herein  inflation has been relatively low and we believe that inflation has not had a material effect on our results of operations 
the impact of inflation is primarily reflected in the increased costs of our operations 
virtually all our assets and liabilities are financial in nature 
our consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes thereto have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance far more than inflation 
inflation affects our operations primarily through its effect on interest rates  since interest rates typically increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
during periods of increasing interest rates  demand for mortgages and a borrower s ability to qualify for mortgage financing in a purchase transaction may be adversely affected 
during periods of decreasing interest rates  borrowers may prepay their mortgages  which in turn may adversely affect our yield and subsequently the value of our portfolio of mortgage assets 
contractual obligations and commitments the company had the following contractual obligations at december  amounts in thousands total less than year to years to years more than years operating leases repurchase agreements cdos subordinated debentures management fees interest rate swaps total contractual obligations amounts include projected interest payments during the period 
interest based on interest rates in effect on december  maturities of our cdos are dependent upon cash flows received from the underlying loans receivable 
our estimate of their repayment is based on scheduled principal payments and estimated principal prepayments based on our internal prepayment model on the underlying loans receivable 
this estimate will differ from actual amounts to the extent prepayments and or loan losses are experienced 
this disclosure assumes that we do not renew the hcs advisory agreement 
advisory and management agreements as of december   the company  hc and nymf were parties to the hcs advisory agreement 
subsequent to december   the company entered into the midway management agreement 
we have agreed to pay the external manager that is a party to each of those agreements certain fees for the performance of certain services thereunder 
see item business for a description of the fees and expenses payable by us under these agreements 
for the years ended december  and  hcs earned aggregate base advisory and consulting fees of approximately million and million  respectively  and an incentive fee of approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   hcs was managing approximately million of assets on the company s behalf 
as of december  and  the company had a management fee payable totaling million and million  respectively  included in accrued expenses and other liabilities 
significance of estimates and critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap  many of which require the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
these estimates are based  in part  on our judgment and assumptions regarding various economic conditions that we believe are reasonable based on facts and circumstances existing at the time of reporting 
the results of these estimates affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of income  expenses and other comprehensive income during the periods presented 
changes in the estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on these financial statements 
accounting policies and estimates related to specific components of our consolidated financial statements are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sec guidance  those material accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition and which require complex management judgment are discussed below 
revenue recognition 
interest income on our residential mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities is a combination of the interest earned based on the outstanding principal balance of the underlying loan security  the contractual terms of the assets and the amortization of yield adjustments  principally premiums and discounts  using generally accepted interest methods 
the net gaap cost over the par balance of self originated loans held for investment and premium and discount associated with the purchase of mortgage backed securities and loans are amortized into interest income over the lives of the underlying assets using the effective yield method as adjusted for the effects of estimated prepayments 
estimating prepayments and the remaining term of our interest yield investments require management judgment  which involves  among other things  consideration of possible future interest rate environments and an estimate of how borrowers will react to those environments  historical trends and performance 
the actual prepayment speed and actual lives could be more or less than the amount estimated by management at the time of origination or purchase of the assets or at each financial reporting period 
with respect to interest rate swaps and caps that have not been designated as hedges  any net payments under  or fluctuations in the fair value of  such swaps and caps will be recognized in current earnings 
fair value 
the company has established and documented processes for determining fair values 
fair value is based upon quoted market prices  where available 
if listed prices or quotes are not available  then fair value is based upon internally developed models that primarily use inputs that are market based or independently sourced market parameters  including interest rate yield curves 
a financial instrument s categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the three levels of valuation hierarchy are defined as follows level inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets 
level inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets  and inputs that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
level inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value measurement 
the following describes the valuation methodologies used for the company s financial instruments measured at fair value  as well as the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy 
a 
investment securities available for sale rmbs fair value for the rmbs in our portfolio is based on quoted prices provided by dealers who make markets in similar financial instruments 
the dealers will incorporate common market pricing methods  including a spread measurement to the treasury curve or interest rate swap curve as well as underlying characteristics of the particular security including coupon  periodic and life caps  collateral type  rate reset period and seasoning or age of the security 
if quoted prices for a security are not reasonably available from a dealer  the security will be re classified as a level security and  as a result  management will determine the fair value based on characteristics of the security that the company receives from the issuer and based on available market information 
management reviews all prices used in determining valuation to ensure they represent current market conditions 
this review includes surveying similar market transactions  comparisons to interest pricing models as well as offerings of like securities by dealers 
the company investment securities that are comprised of rmbs are valued based upon readily observable market parameters and are classified as level fair values 
b 
investment securities available for sale clo the fair value of the clo notes  as of december   was based on management s valuation determined by using a discounted future cash flows model that management believes would be used by market participants to value similar financial instruments 
at december   the fair value of the clo notes was based on quoted prices provided by dealers who make markets in similar financial instruments 
the clo notes were previously classified as level fair values and were re classified as level fair values in the fourth quarter of c 
interest rate swaps and caps the fair value of interest rate swaps and caps are based on dealer quotes 
the model utilizes readily observable market parameters  including treasury rates  interest rate swap spreads and swaption volatility curves 
the company s interest rate caps and swaps are classified as level fair values 
mortgage loans held for sale net the fair value of mortgage loans held for sale net are estimated by the company based on the price that would be received if the loans were sold as whole loans taking into consideration the aggregated characteristics of the loans such as  but not limited to  collateral type  index  interest rate  margin  length of fixed interest rate period  life cap  periodic cap  underwriting standards  age and credit 
mortgage loans held in securitization trusts net impaired loans impaired mortgage loans held in the securitization trusts are recorded at amortized cost less specific loan loss reserves 
impaired loan value is based on management s estimate of the net realizable value taking into consideration local market conditions of the distressed property  updated appraisal values of the property and estimated expenses required to remediate the impaired loan 
real estate owned held in securitization trusts real estate owned held in the securitization trusts are recorded at net realizable value 
any subsequent adjustment will result in the reduction in carrying value with the corresponding amount charge to earnings 
net realizable value based on an estimate of disposal taking into consideration local market conditions of the distressed property  updated appraisal values of the property and estimated expenses required sell the property 
mortgage loans held for investment mortgage loans held for investment are stated at unpaid principal balance  adjusted for any unamortized premium or discount  deferred fees or expenses  net of valuation allowances 
loans are considered to be impaired when it is probable that based upon current information and events  the company will be unable to collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
based on the facts and circumstances of the individual loans being impaired  loan specific valuation allowances are established for the excess carrying value of the loan over either i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate  ii the estimated fair value of the loan s underlying collateral if the loan is in the process of foreclosure or otherwise collateral dependent  or iii the loan s observable market price 
investment in limited partnership interest management periodically reviews its investments for impairment based on projected cash flows from the entity over the holding period 
when any impairment is identified  the investments are written down to recoverable amounts

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
because we are invested solely in us dollar denominated instruments  primarily residential mortgage instruments  and our borrowings are also domestic and us dollar denominated  we are not subject to foreign currency exchange  or commodity and equity price risk  the primary market risk that we are exposed to is interest rate risk and its related ancillary risks 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
all of our market risk sensitive assets  liabilities and related derivative positions are for non trading purposes only 
management recognizes the following primary risks associated with our business and the industry in which we conduct business interest rate risk liquidity risk prepayment risk credit risk market fair value risk interest rate risk interest rates are sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary  tax policies  domestic and international economic conditions  and political or regulatory matters beyond our control 
changes in interest rates affect the value of our rmbs and arm loans we manage and hold in our investment portfolio  the variable rate borrowings we use to finance our portfolio  and the interest rate swaps and caps we use to hedge our portfolio 
all of our portfolio interest market risk sensitive assets  liabilities and related derivative positions are managed with a long term perspective and are not for trading purposes 
interest rate risk is measured by the sensitivity of our current and future earnings to interest rate volatility  variability of spread relationships  the difference in re pricing intervals between our assets and liabilities and the effect that interest rates may have on our cash flows  especially the speed at which prepayments occur on our residential mortgage related assets 
changes in interest rates can affect our net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income earned on assets and our interest expense incurred in connection with our borrowings 
our adjustable rate hybrid arm assets reset on various dates that are not matched to the reset dates on our repurchase agreements 
in general  the repricing of our repurchase agreements occurs more quickly than the repricing of our assets 
first  our floating rate borrowings may react to changes in interest rates before our adjustable rate assets because the weighted average next re pricing dates on the related borrowings may have shorter time periods than that of the adjustable rate assets 
second  interest rates on adjustable rate assets may be limited to a periodic cap or an increase of typically or per adjustment period  while our borrowings do not have comparable limitations 
third  our adjustable rate assets typically lag changes in the applicable interest rate indices by days due to the notice period provided to adjustable rate borrowers when the interest rates on their loans are scheduled to change 
we seek to manage interest rate risk in the portfolio by utilizing interest rate swaps and interest rate caps  with the goal of optimizing the earnings potential while seeking to maintain long term stable portfolio values 
we continually monitor the duration of our mortgage assets and have a policy to hedge the financing such that the net duration of the assets  our borrowed funds related to such assets  and related hedging instruments  are less than one year 
interest rates can also affect our net return on hybrid arm securities and loans net of the cost of financing hybrid arms 
we continually monitor and estimate the duration of our hybrid arms and have a policy to hedge the financing of the hybrid arms such that the net duration of the hybrid arms  our borrowed funds related to such assets  and related hedging instruments are less than one year 
during a declining interest rate environment  the prepayment of hybrid arms may accelerate as borrowers may opt to refinance at a lower rate causing the amount of liabilities that have been extended by the use of interest rate swaps to increase relative to the amount of hybrid arms  possibly resulting in a decline in our net return on hybrid arms as replacement hybrid arms may have a lower yield than those being prepaid 
conversely  during an increasing interest rate environment  hybrid arms may prepay slower than expected  requiring us to finance a higher amount of hybrid arms than originally forecast and at a time when interest rates may be higher  resulting in a decline in our net return on hybrid arms 
our exposure to changes in the prepayment speeds of hybrid arms is mitigated by regular monitoring of the outstanding balance of hybrid arms  and adjusting the amounts anticipated to be outstanding in future periods and  on a regular basis  making adjustments to the amount of our fixed rate borrowing obligations for future periods 
we utilize a model based risk analysis system to assist in projecting portfolio performances over a scenario of different interest rates 
the model incorporates shifts in interest rates  changes in prepayments and other factors impacting the valuations of our financial securities  including mortgage backed securities  repurchase agreements  interest rate swaps and interest rate caps 
based on the results of the model  as of december   instantaneous changes in interest rates would have had the following effect on net interest income dollar amounts in thousands changes in net interest income changes in interest rates changes in net interest income interest rate changes may also impact our net book value as our mortgage assets and related hedge derivatives are marked to market each quarter 
generally  as interest rates increase  the value of our mortgage assets decrease and as interest rates decrease  the value of such investments will increase 
in general  we would expect however that  over time  decreases in value of our portfolio attributable to interest rate changes will be offset  to the degree we are hedged  by increases in value of our interest rate swaps  and vice versa 
however  the relationship between spreads on securities and spreads on swaps may vary from time to time  resulting in a net aggregate book value increase or decline 
that said  unless there is a material impairment in value that would result in a payment not being received on a security or loan  changes in the book value of our portfolio will not directly affect our recurring earnings or our ability to make a distribution to our stockholders 
liquidity risk liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  fund and maintain investments  pay dividends to our stockholders and other general business needs 
we recognize the need to have funds available to operate our business 
it is our policy to have adequate liquidity at all times 
we plan to meet liquidity through normal operations with the goal of avoiding unplanned sales of assets or emergency borrowing of funds 
our principal sources of liquidity are the repurchase agreements on our rmbs  the cdos we have issued to finance our loans held in securitization trusts  the principal and interest payments from mortgage assets and cash proceeds from the issuance of equity securities as market and other conditions permit 
we believe our existing cash balances and cash flows from operations will be sufficient for our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
as it relates to our investment portfolio  derivative financial instruments we use to hedge interest rate risk subject us to margin call risk 
if the value of our pledged assets decrease  due to a change in interest rates  credit characteristics  or other pricing factors  we may be required to post additional cash or asset collateral  or reduce the amount we are able to borrower versus the collateral 
under our interest rate swaps typically we pay a fixed rate to the counterparties while they pay us a floating rate 
if interest rates drop below the fixed rate we are paying on an interest rate swap  we may be required to post cash margin 
prepayment risk when borrowers repay the principal on their mortgage loans before maturity or faster than their scheduled amortization  the effect is to shorten the period over which interest is earned  and therefore  reduce the yield for mortgage assets purchased at a premium to their then current balance  as with the majority of our assets 
conversely  mortgage assets purchased for less than their then current balance exhibit higher yields due to faster prepayments 
furthermore  prepayment speeds exceeding or lower than our modeled prepayment speeds impact the effectiveness of any hedges we have in place to mitigate financing and or fair value risk 
generally  when market interest rates decline  borrowers have a tendency to refinance their mortgages  thereby increasing prepayments 
our prepayment model will help determine the amount of hedging we use to off set changes in interest rates 
if actual prepayment rates are higher than modeled  the yield will be less than modeled in cases where we paid a premium for the particular mortgage asset 
conversely  when we have paid a premium  if actual prepayment rates experienced are slower than modeled  we would amortize the premium over a longer time period  resulting in a higher yield to maturity 
in an increasing prepayment environment  the timing difference between the actual cash receipt of principal paydowns and the announcement of the principal paydown may result in additional margin requirements from our repurchase agreement counterparties 
we mitigate prepayment risk by constantly evaluating our mortgage assets relative to prepayment speeds observed for assets with a similar structure  quality and characteristics 
furthermore  we stress test the portfolio as to prepayment speeds and interest rate risk in order to further develop or make modifications to our hedge balances 
historically  we have not hedged of our liability costs due to prepayment risk 
credit risk credit risk is the risk that we will not fully collect the principal we have invested in mortgage loans or other assets due to either borrower defaults  or a counterparty failure 
our portfolio of loans held in securitization trusts as of december  consisted of approximately million of securitized first liens originated in and earlier 
the securitized first liens were principally originated in by our subsidiary  hc  prior to our exit from the mortgage lending business 
these are predominately high quality loans with an average loan to value ltv ratio at origination of approximately  and average borrower fico score of approximately in addition  approximately of these loans were originated with full income and asset verification 
while we feel that our origination and underwriting of these loans will help to mitigate the risk of significant borrower default on these loans  we cannot assure you that all borrowers will continue to satisfy their payment obligations under these loans and thereby avoid default 
as of december   we owned approximately million on non agency rmbs senior securities 
the non agency rmbs has a weighted average amortized purchase price of approximately of current par value 
management believes the purchase price discount coupled with the credit support within the bond structure protects us from principal loss under most stress scenarios for these non agency rmbs 
in addition  as of december  we own approximately million of notes issued by a clo at a discounted purchase price equal to of par 
the securities are backed by a portfolio of middle market corporate loans 
market fair value risk changes in interest rates also expose us to market risk that the market value fair value on our assets may decline 
for certain of the financial instruments that we own  fair values will not be readily available since there are no active trading markets for these instruments as characterized by current exchanges between willing parties 
accordingly  fair values can only be derived or estimated for these investments using various valuation techniques  such as computing the present value of estimated future cash flows using discount rates commensurate with the risks involved 
however  the determination of estimated future cash flows is inherently subjective and imprecise 
minor changes in assumptions or estimation methodologies can have a material effect on these derived or estimated fair values 
these estimates and assumptions are indicative of the interest rate environments as of december   and do not take into consideration the effects of subsequent interest rate fluctuations 
we note that the values of our investments in mortgage backed securities and in derivative instruments  primarily interest rate hedges on our debt  will be sensitive to changes in market interest rates  interest rate spreads  credit spreads and other market factors 
the value of these investments can vary and has varied materially from period to period 
historically  the values of our mortgage loan portfolio have tended to vary inversely with those of its derivative instruments 
the following describes the methods and assumptions we use in estimating fair values of our financial instruments fair value estimates are made as of a specific point in time based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques 
these techniques involve uncertainties and are significantly affected by the assumptions used and the judgments made regarding risk characteristics of various financial instruments  discount rates  estimate of future cashflows  future expected loss experience and other factors 
changes in assumptions could significantly affect these estimates and the resulting fair values 
derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and  in many cases  could not be realized in an immediate sale of the instrument 
also  because of differences in methodologies and assumptions used to estimate fair values  the fair values used by us should not be compared to those of other companies 
the fair values of our investment securities are generally based on market prices provided by dealers who make markets in these financial instruments 
if the fair value of a security is not reasonably available from a dealer  management estimates the fair value based on characteristics of the security that we receive from the issuer and on available market information 
the fair value of mortgage loans held in securitization trusts is estimated using pricing models and taking into consideration the aggregated characteristics of groups of loans such as  but not limited to  collateral type  index  interest rate  margin  length of fixed rate period  life cap  periodic cap  underwriting standards  age and credit estimated using the estimated market prices for similar types of loans 
due to significant market dislocation over the past months  secondary market prices were given minimal weighting in determining the fair value of these loans at december  and the fair value of these cdos is based on discounted cash flows as well as market pricing on comparable cdos 
the market risk management discussion and the amounts estimated from the analysis that follows are forward looking statements that assume that certain market conditions occur 
actual results may differ materially from these projected results due to changes in our portfolio assets and borrowings mix and due to developments in the domestic and global financial and real estate markets 
developments in the financial markets include the likelihood of changing interest rates and the relationship of various interest rates and their impact on our portfolio yield  cost of funds and cash flows 
the analytical methods that we use to assess and mitigate these market risks should not be considered projections of future events or operating performance 
as a financial institution that has only invested in us dollar denominated instruments  primarily residential mortgage instruments  and has only borrowed money in the domestic market  we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
rather  our market risk exposure is largely due to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk impacts our interest income  interest expense and the market value on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
the management of interest rate risk attempts to maximize earnings and to preserve capital by minimizing the negative impacts of changing market rates  asset and liability mix  and prepayment activity 
the table below presents the sensitivity of the market value and net duration changes of our portfolio as of december   using a discounted cash flow simulation model assuming an instantaneous interest rate shift 
application of this method results in an estimation of the fair market value change of our assets  liabilities and hedging instruments per basis point bp shift in interest rates 
the use of hedging instruments is a critical part of our interest rate risk management strategies  and the effects of these hedging instruments on the market value of the portfolio are reflected in the model output 
this analysis also takes into consideration the value of options embedded in our mortgage assets including constraints on the re pricing of the interest rate of assets resulting from periodic and lifetime cap features  as well as prepayment options 
assets and liabilities that are not interest rate sensitive such as cash  payment receivables  prepaid expenses  payables and accrued expenses are excluded 
changes in assumptions including  but not limited to  volatility  mortgage and financing spreads  prepayment behavior  defaults  as well as the timing and level of interest rate changes will affect the results of the model 
therefore  actual results are likely to vary from modeled results 
market value changes changes in interest rates changes in market value net duration amount in thousands years years base years years it should be noted that the model is used as a tool to identify potential risk in a changing interest rate environment but does not include any changes in portfolio composition  financing strategies  market spreads or changes in overall market liquidity 
based on the assumptions used  the model output suggests a very low degree of portfolio price change given increases in interest rates  which implies that our cash flow and earning characteristics should be relatively stable for comparable changes in interest rates 
although market value sensitivity analysis is widely accepted in identifying interest rate risk  it does not take into consideration changes that may occur such as  but not limited to  changes in investment and financing strategies  changes in market spreads and changes in business volumes 
accordingly  we make extensive use of an earnings simulation model to further analyze our level of interest rate risk 
there are a number of key assumptions in our earnings simulation model 
these key assumptions include changes in market conditions that affect interest rates  the pricing of arm products  the availability of investment assets and the availability and the cost of financing for portfolio assets 
other key assumptions made in using the simulation model include prepayment speeds and management investment  financing and hedging strategies  and the issuance of new equity 
we typically run the simulation model under a variety of hypothetical business scenarios that may include different interest rate scenarios  different investment strategies  different prepayment possibilities and other scenarios that provide us with a range of possible earnings outcomes in order to assess potential interest rate risk 
the assumptions used represent our estimate of the likely effect of changes in interest rates and do not necessarily reflect actual results 
the earnings simulation model takes into account periodic and lifetime caps embedded in our assets in determining the earnings at risk
