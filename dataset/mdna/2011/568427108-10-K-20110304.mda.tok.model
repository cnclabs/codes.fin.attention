item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based upon and should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and financial statements and supplementary data 
see also forward looking statements on page overview marine products  through our wholly owned subsidiaries chaparral and robalo  is a leading manufacturer of recreational fiberglass powerboats 
our sales and profits are generated by selling the products that we manufacture to a network of independent dealers who in turn sell the products to retail consumers 
these dealers are located throughout the continental united states and in several international markets 
most of these dealers finance their inventory through third party floor plan lenders  who pay marine products upon delivery of the products to the dealers 
we manage our company by focusing on the execution of the following business and financial strategies manufacturing high quality  stylish  and innovative powerboats for our dealers and retail consumers  providing our independent dealer network appropriate incentives  training  and other support to enhance their success and their customers satisfaction  thereby facilitating their continued relationship with us  managing our production and dealer order backlog to optimize operating results and reduce risk in the event of a further downturn in sales of our products  maintaining a flexible  variable cost structure which can be reduced quickly when deemed appropriate  focusing on the competitive nature of the boating business and designing our products and strategies in order to grow and maintain profitable market share  monitoring the activities and financial condition of our dealers and of the third party floor plan lenders who finance our dealers inventories  maximizing stockholder return by optimizing the balance of cash invested in the company s productive assets  the payment of dividends to stockholders  and the repurchase of the company s common stock on the open market  and aligning the interests of our management and stockholders 
in implementing these strategies and attempting to optimize our financial returns  management closely monitors dealer orders and inventories  the production mix of various models  and indications of near term demand such as consumer confidence  interest rates  dealer orders placed at our annual dealer conferences  and retail attendance and orders at annual winter boat show exhibitions 
we also consider trends related to certain key financial and other data  including our historical and forecasted financial results  market share  unit sales of our products  average selling price per boat  and gross profit margins  among others  as indicators of the success of our strategies 
marine products financial results are affected by consumer confidence because pleasure boating is a discretionary expenditure  interest rates b ecause many retail customers finance the purchase of their boats  and other socioeconomic and environmental factors such as availability of leisure time  consumer preferences  demographics and the weather 
during  industry retail sales declined  continuing a trend that began in the fourth quarter of retail sales have continued to decline due to the financial crisis which began in late and the resulting recession  decline in residential real estate values  and the associated decline in consumer confidence 
in addition  retail boat sales declined in because demand had been stimulated in by large incentives offered by manufacturers  dealers and floor plan lenders 
these incentives were used to liquidate dealer inventories below normal operating levels in order to reduce dealers financial liabilities  thereby enhancing their financial solvency 
in spite of weak retail sales  our production levels and sales to dealers were significantly higher in than in due to our dealers desire to restock their inventory with current year models as well as their ability to purchase inventory due to the availability of financing from third party floor plan lenders 
our production and sales to dealers were significantly higher  and our incentives offered to dealers to liquidate inventories were more normalized 
as a result  we generated higher net sales  as well as gross and operating profit and net income in compared to losses in management will continue to monitor retail demand  dealer inventory levels and the availability of dealer and consumer financing for the purchase of our products 
we monitor our market share in the to foot sterndrive category as one indicator of the success of our strategies and the market s acceptance of our products 
for the nine months ended september  latest data available to us  chaparral s market share in the to foot sterndrive category was percent  a decrease from our market share in the same category for the twelve months ended december  of percent 
this decrease was concentrated in the smaller boats in our market 
we believe that our decrease in market share is the result of inventory liquidation by financially distressed manufacturers and dealers during we also believe that our relatively lower market share decline among larger boats is the result of our stated strategy of selling larger  more profitable boats 
 although we will continue to monitor our market share and believe it to be important  we also believe that maximizing profitability takes precedence over growing our market share 
outlook management believes that net sales will increase moderately in compared to and that our operating results will improve 
this belief is based on indications that the downturn in recreational boating has ended  and the fact that our dealer inventories are at more normalized historical levels 
we believe that our dealers inventory levels are appropriate given current retail sales and our production levels 
we also believe that these dealer inventory levels will allow us to increase production in the event of an increase in demand during the upcoming retail selling season 
early indications from winter boat shows are that attendance and sales are moderately higher than in our operating results should moderately improve due to higher volumes and an improved gross margin from improve d production efficiencies and cost absorption 
we do not believe that retail sales will increase significantly in due to a slow recovery from the recession  continued high unemployment  depressed real estate values and continued weak consumer confidence 
we believe that these factors dampen consumers enthusiasm for the purchase of large discretionary goods such as pleasure boats 
in addition  consumer credit remains tight and fuel prices are much higher than at this time last year 
over the long term  the recent financial crisis may have long term effects on consumer behavior with regard to pleasure boating 
in such a case  consumers may not purchase boats  may purchase boats later in their lives  or may purchase smaller  less expensive boats 
over the past several years  marine products as well as other manufacturers have been improving their c ustomer service capabilities  marketing strategies and sales promotions in order to attract more consumers to recreational boating as well as improve consumers boating experiences 
in addition  the recreational boating industry began a promotional program several years ago which involves advertising and consumer targeting efforts  as well as other activities designed to increase the potential consumer market for pleasure boats 
many manufacturers  including marine products  are participating in this program 
management believes that these efforts will benefit the industry and marine products 
as in past years  marine products enhanced the design of a number of boats for the model year which began on july  for this model year  marine products is producing slightly more models with more standard features and fewer options  as well as utilizing a manufacturing process for certain models which allows several interior options to be fabricated separately  thus allowing the company and its deale rs to optimize inventory requirements while meeting retail demand 
our financial results in will depend on a number of factors  including interest rates  consumer confidence  the availability of credit to our dealers and consumers  fuel costs  the continued acceptance of our new products in the recreational boating market  our ability to compete in the competitive pleasure boating industry  and the costs of certain of our raw materials and key components 
we anticipate that the company will continue to be challenged by the effect of an uncertain level of consumer demand during the winter boat show and retail selling seasons

cash used for financing activities decreased million in compared to primarily due to a reduction in dividends paid per share during compared to coupled with lower excess tax benefits for share based payments and lower common share repurchases in the current year 
cash provided by operating activities decreased by million in compared to this decrease is primarily the result of a decrease in earnings in compared to and the very significant reduction in working capital requirements occurring during this reduction in working capital requirements was primarily related to the large decline in inventory when production levels declined in response to lower demand and sales 
cash used for investing activities decreased million in compared to  resulting primarily from lower net purchases of marketable securities in compared to cash used for financing activities decreased million in compared to due to a reduction during in dividends paid per share coupled with the reduction in cash used to repurchase stock on the open market 
cash requirements management expects that capital expenditures during will be approximately million for minor enhancements to certain manufacturing plants 
the company participates in a multiple employer retirement income plan  sponsored by rpc  inc rpc 
during the second quarter of  the company made a contribution of thousand to this plan in order to achieve the company s funding objective 
we expect that additional contributions to the retirement income plan of approximately million will be required in on april   the board of directors voted to suspend the quarterly cash dividend to common stockholders 
the company has agreements with two employees  which provide for a monthly payment to the employees equal to percent of profits defined as pretax income before goodwill amortization and certain allocated corporate expenses 
on january   the board of directors authorized an additional  shares that the company may repurchase for a total aggregate authorization of  shares 
as of december   the company has purchased a total of  shares in the open market under this program and there are  shares that remain available for repurchase 
the company did not repurchase any shares under this program during the company has entered into agreements with third party floor plan lenders where it has agreed  in the event of default by the dealer  to repurchase mpc boats repossessed from the dealer 
these arrangements are subject to maximum repurchase amounts and the associated risk is mitigated by the value of the boats repurchased 
there were no repurchases of dealer inventory during the company incurred obligations for inventory repurchases totaling approximately million during resulting from dealer defaults on floor plan financing 
at december  and  there were no amounts payable to lenders related to repurchased inventory or repurchased boats remaining in inventory 
if additional dealers experience financial difficulty as a result of the current market conditions  the company may incur additional repurch ase obligations under current programs or programs initiated in the future 
see further information regarding repurchase obligations in note commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes that the liquidity provided by its existing cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and cash expected to be generated from operations will provide sufficient capital to meet its requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company s decisions about the amount of cash to be used for investing and financing purposes are influenced by its capital position and the expected amount of cash to be provided by operations 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligation operating leases purchase obligations due to floor plan lenders other long term liabilities total operating leases represent agreements for warehouse space and various office equipment 
as part of the normal course of business the company enters into purchase commitments to manage its various operating needs 
however  the company does not have any obligations that are non cancelable or subject to a penalty if canceled 
the company has agreements with various third party lenders where it guarantees varying amounts of debt for qualifying dealers on boats in inventory 
as of december   there are no payables outstanding to floor plan lenders 
additionally  our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and related interest and penalties was  as of december  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate as to when cash settlement with the tax authorities might occur due to the uncertainties related to these tax matters 
fair value measurements the company s assets and liabilities measured at fair value are classified in the fair value hierarchy level  or based on the inputs used for valuation 
assets and liabilities that are traded on an exchange with a quoted price are classified as level assets and liabilities that are valued using significant observable inputs in addition to quoted market prices are classified as level the company currently has no assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis that are valued using unobservable inputs and therefore no assets or liabilities measured on a recurring basis are classified as level for defined benefit plan assets classified as level  the values are computed using inputs such as cost  discounted future cash flows  independent appraisals and market based comparable data or on net asset values calculate d by the fund and not publicly available 
in  the company transferred trading securities from assets utilizing level inputs to assets utilizing level inputs because significant observable inputs in addition to quoted market prices were used to value these trading securities 
also in  due to market disruptions that led to decreased availability of quoted prices for identical assets  the company classified available for sale securities  consisting primarily of municipal bonds  from assets utilizing level inputs to assets utilizing level inputs 
off balance sheet arrangements to assist dealers in obtaining financing for the purchase of its boats for inventory  the company has entered into agreements with various third party floor plan lenders whereby the company guarantees varying amounts of debt for qualifying dealers on boats in inventory 
the company s obligation under these guarantees becomes effective in the case of a default under the financing arrangement between the dealer and the third party lender 
the agreements typically provide for the return of all repossessed boats in new and unused condition subject to normal wear and tear  as defined  to the company  in exchange for the company s assumption of specified percentages of the debt obligation on those boats  up to certain contractually determined dollar limits which vary by lender 
there were no repurchases of dealer inve ntory during during  mpc became contractually obligated to repurchase inventory of approximately million as a result of dealer defaults  none of which remained outstanding as of december  all of these repossessed boats were redistributed among existing and replacement dealers 
management continues to monitor the risk of additional defaults and resulting repurchase obligation based primarily upon information provided by the third party floor plan lenders and to adjust the guarantee liability at the end of each reporting period based on information reasonably available at that time 
as of december   the company believes the fair value of its remaining guarantee liability is immaterial 
see further information regarding repurchase obligations in note commitments and contingencies of the consolidated financial statements 
during  an amendment to the current agreement with one of the company s floor plan lenders was executed with a contractual repurchase limit of million effective january  which expired june  effective july   this agreement was further amended to change the contractual repurchase limit to not exceed percent of the amount of the average net receivables financed by the floor plan lender for dealers during the prior month period 
the company has contractual repurchase agreements with additional lenders with an aggregate maximum repurchase obligation of approximately million  with various expiration and cancellation terms of less t han one year  for an aggregate remaining repurchase obligation with all financing institutions of approximately million as of december  although the company has these agreements with financial institutions  in certain situations  the company may decide for business reasons to repurchase boats in excess of these contractual amounts 
related party transactions in conjunction with its spin off from rpc in  the company and rpc entered into various agreements that define the companies relationship after the spin off 
the transition support services agreement provides for rpc to provide certain services  including financial reporting and income tax administration  acquisition assistance  etc  to marine products until the agreement is terminated by either party 
marine products reimbursed rpc for its estimated allocable share of administrative costs incurred for services rendered on behalf of marine products totaling  in   in  and  in the company s liability to rpc for these services as of december  and was approximately  the company s directors are also directors of rpc and all of the company s executive officers with the exception of one are employees of both the company and rpc 
the company has cash held at a bank branch  which is affiliated with one of our executive officers who is also a director 
the company had a cash balance at this bank of  at december  and of  at december  with interest income earned on collected balances totaling  during   during and  during the employee benefits agreement provides for  among other things  the company s employees to continue participating subsequent to the spin off in two rpc sponsored benefit plans  specifically  the defined contribution k plan and the defined benefit retirement income plan

randall rollins and his brother gary w

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
sales recognition the company sells its boats through its network of independent dealers 
sales orders used to plan production are firm indications of interest from dealers and are cancelable at any time  although historically very few orders are cancelled after they have been placed 
the company recognizes sales when all the following conditions are met a fully executed sales agreement exists  the price of the boat is established  the dealer takes delivery of the boat  and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
sales incentives and discounts the company records incentives as a reduction of sales 
using historical trends and management estimates  adjusted for current changes  the company estimates the amount of incentives that will be paid in the future on boats sold and accrues an estimated liability 
the company offers various incentives that promote sales to dealers  and to a lesser extent  retail customers 
these incentives are designed to encourage timely replenishment of dealer inventories after peak selling seasons  stabilize manufacturing volumes throughout the year  and improve production model mix 
the dealer incentive programs are a combination of annual volume commitment discounts  and additional discounts at time of invoice for those dealers who do not finance their inventory through specified floor plan financing agreements 
the annual dealer volume discounts are primarily based on july through june model year purchases 
in addition  the company offers at various times other time specific or model specific incentives 
the factors that complicate the calculation of the cost of these incentives are the ability to forecast sales of the company and individual dealers  the volume and timing of inventory financed by specific dealers  identification of which boats have been sold subject to an incentive  and the estimated lag time between sales and payment of incentives 
settlement of the incentives generally occurs from three to twelve months after the sale 
the company regularly analyzes the historical incentive trends and makes adjustments to recorded liabilities for changes in trends and terms of incentive programs 
total incentives recorded in net sales as a percentage of gross sales were percent in  percent in  and percent in a percentage point change in incentives as a percentage of gross sales during would have increased or decreased net sales  gross margin and operating income by approximately million 
warranty costs the company records as part of selling  general and administrative expense an experience based estimate of the future warranty costs to be incurred when sales are recognized 
the company evaluates its warranty obligation on a model year basis 
the company provides warranties against manufacturing defects for various components of the boats  primarily the fiberglass deck and hull  with warranty periods extending up to years 
warranty costs  if any  on other components of the boats are generally absorbed by the original component manufacturer 
warranty costs can vary depending upon the size and number of components in the boats sold  the pre sale warranty claims  and the desired level of customer service 
while we focus on high quality manufacturing programs and processes  including actively monitoring the quality of our component suppliers and managing the dealer and customer service warranty experience and reimbursements  our estimated warranty obligation is based upon the warranty terms and the company s enforcement of those terms over time  defects  repair costs  and the volume and mix of boat sales 
the estimate of warranty costs is regularly analyzed and is adjusted based on several factors including the actual claims that occur 
warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was percent in  percent in  and percent in warranty expense as a percentage of net sales decreased in compared to due primarily to approximately million in additional warranty expense recognized during relating to the unusually high number of claims associated with prior model year boats sold at retail requiring unanticipated repair costs 
a percentage point increase in the estimated warranty expense as a percentage of net sales during would have increased selling  general and ad ministrative expenses and reduced operating income by approximately million 
income taxes the effective income tax rates were percent in  percent in  and percent in the effective tax rates vary due to changes in estimates of future taxable income  fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which the earnings and deductions are realized  variations in the relationship of tax exempt income or losses to income before taxes and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments 
as a result  the effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 
the company establishes a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income 
such amounts are charged to earnings in the period the determination is made 
likewise  if it is later determined that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance is reversed 
the company considers future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the company operates  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
the company calculates the current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse 
the amount of income taxes the company pays is subject to ongoing audits by federal and state tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
the company believes it has adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which earnings or deductions are realized may differ from current estimates

the amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning in january with early adoption permitted
