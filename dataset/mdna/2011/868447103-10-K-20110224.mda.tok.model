item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our historical financial data may not be indicative of our future performance and does not necessarily reflect what our financial condition and results of operations would have been had we operated as an independent  stand alone entity prior to our spin off from verizon in november  particularly since many changes have occurred in our operations and capitalization as a result of the spin off 
during  we filed for and emerged from chapter bankruptcy 
in connection with fresh start accounting  we recorded reorganization items  which include provisions and adjustments to record the carrying value of certain pre petition liabilities at their estimated allowable claim amounts  as well as other costs incurred as a result of our bankruptcy proceedings 
at december   the balances of deferred revenue and deferred directory costs were adjusted to their fair value of zero  which had a significant non cash impact on our operating results 
as a result  approximately million of deferred revenue million net of estimated sales allowances and million of deferred directory costs were not recognized in our consolidated statement of operations which would have otherwise been recorded by the predecessor company 
in addition  our operating results were significantly impacted by the exclusion of approximately million of bad debt expense due to the exclusion of revenue associated with the implementation of fresh start accounting at december  that would have been recognized by our 
table of contents predecessor company 
these non cash fresh start adjustments impact only our consolidated statement of operations and do not affect future years results

sales commissions were previously expensed as incurred 
sales commissions are now deferred as part of deferred directory costs and the cost is recognized over the average life of the advertising service  consistent with our policy for revenue recognition 
the change did not have an impact on cash flows 
all prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the effects of the change 
the number of shares issued in connection with the spin off on november   was approximately million 
for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations  it was assumed that approximately million shares were outstanding for all periods prior to no additional shares were issued through december  approximately million shares were outstanding for equity based awards granted in  and had no material impact on the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
in connection with our spin off on november   we incurred  million in long term debt 
due to the potential events of default resulting from noncompliance with certain covenants in the company s debt agreements and the company s expectation to restructure its capitalization under federal bankruptcy laws  our total outstanding debt of  million was classified as current maturities of long term as of december  upon emergence from bankruptcy  our total outstanding debt of  million was classified as long term

net cash provided by operating activities of million in increased million  compared to million in  primarily due to lower interest payments associated with our bankruptcy filings  the results of spending initiatives  reduced transition costs related to our spin off  and a contract settlement with a former reseller of our advertising in these favorable items were partially offset by increased tax payments and declining revenue 
our payments for other post employment benefit costs were million

table of contents bankruptcy  the portion of the pre petition obligation adequacy protection payment which represented debt principal of million and borrowings in of million under our then existing revolving credit facility 
these increases are partially offset by debt principal payments of million and dividend payments of million in contractual obligations our contractual obligations as of december   are summarized below payments due by period total within year years years more than years in millions debt obligations and associated interest payments operating lease obligations other post employment benefit obligations total our total outstanding debt obligations are  million 
the senior secured term loans must be repaid in full on december  the company has the right to prepay at par the senior secured term loans in whole or in part  from time to time  without premium or penalty  subject to specified requirements as to size and manner of payment 
after each fiscal quarter  the company must also prepay outstanding senior secured term loans in an aggregate amount equal to of the amount of any increase in the company s available cash  as defined in the loan agreement  during such fiscal quarter  less the principal amount of any voluntary prepayments made during such quarter 
our interest obligations are variable based on abr or libor and are payable quarterly based on the outstanding debt balance during the period 
during  the company paid interest of million 
due to the uncertainty of the amount of the principal payments from available cash and voluntary prepayments  interest payments in future years cannot be reasonably estimated 
for additional information on our debt obligations  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
the anticipated obligations for unrecognized tax benefits which would require cash settlements were million as of december  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing and amount of cash flows related to these unrecognized tax benefit liabilities  thus we cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts and periods 
critical accounting policies the following is a summary of the critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition revenue is earned primarily from the sale of advertising 
the sale of advertising in print directories is the primary source of revenue 
we recognize revenue from print directory advertising ratably over the life of each directory using the amortization method of accounting  with revenue recognition commencing in the month of publication 
revenue derived from internet advertising is earned primarily from two sources fixed fee and performance based advertising 
fixed fee advertising includes advertisement placement on our and other local search websites  website development and website hosting for client advertisers 
revenue from fixed fee advertisers is recognized ratably over the life of the advertising service 
performance based advertising revenue is earned when consumers connect with client advertisers by a click on their internet advertising or a phone call to their business 
performance based advertising revenue is recognized when there is evidence that qualifying transactions have occurred 
some of our revenue agreements contain multiple deliverables that involve one or more of our advertising media 
revenue from these agreements is allocated to the separate units of accounting using the relative selling price method 
in connection with our adoption of fresh start accounting in  the fair value of the deferred revenue was determined to be zero 
we did not have remaining performance obligations related to our clients who had previously contracted for advertising  thus  no value was assigned to deferred revenue 
as a result  deferred revenue of approximately million million net of estimated sales allowance was not recognized in our consolidated statement of operations which would have been otherwise recorded by the predecessor company 

table of contents expense recognition costs directly attributable to producing directories are amortized over the average life of a directory under the deferral and amortization method 
direct costs include paper  printing  initial distribution and sales commissions 
paper costs are stated on an average cost basis 
all other costs are recognized as incurred 
in connection with the company s adoption of fresh start accounting in  the fair value of deferred directory costs was determined to be zero 
the deferred directory costs as of december  did not have future value since the company had already incurred the costs to produce the clients advertising and did not expect to incur additional costs associated with those published directories 
as a result  deferred directory costs of million was not recognized in our consolidated statement of operations which would have been otherwise recorded by the predecessor company 
accounts receivable and unbilled accounts receivable accounts receivable in the december  consolidated balance sheet includes amounts billed to clients but not yet collected of million and amounts to be billed for services already provided and revenue recognized of million  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
accounts receivable is recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is calculated using a percentage of sales method  based upon collection history  and an estimate of uncollectible accounts 
management may exercise judgment in adjusting the provision as a consequence of known items  such as current economic factors and credit trends 
accounts receivable adjustments are recorded against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue was  and  for the years  and  respectively 
in connection with the company s adoption of fresh start accounting  the company s unbilled accounts receivable were recorded at their fair value of million on december  unbilled receivables represent amounts that are not billable at the balance sheet date but are billed over the remaining life of the clients advertising contracts 
the company billed the unbilled accounts receivable over the course of goodwill the company has goodwill of  million on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  in accordance with applicable us gaap  impairment testing for goodwill is performed at least annually unless indicators of impairment exist 
the impairment test for goodwill uses a two step approach  which is performed at the entity level the reporting unit 
step one compares the fair value of the reporting unit calculated using the enterprise value market capitalization approach to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  there is a potential impairment and step two must be performed 
step two compares the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its implied fair value ie  the fair value of the reporting unit less the fair value of the unit s assets and liabilities  including identifiable intangible assets 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  the excess is required to be recorded as an impairment 
the company performed its impairment test of goodwill in the fourth quarter of the company determined the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit  therefore there was no impairment of goodwill 
intangible assets the company has intangible assets of million on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  intangible assets are to be recorded separately from goodwill if they meet certain criteria 
internal use software is capitalized if it has a useful life in excess of one year 
subsequent additions  modifications or upgrades to internal use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task it previously did not perform 
the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets are presented in the table below estimated useful lives in years client relationships patented technologies internal use software marketing related indefinite 
table of contents client relationships and patented technologies are amortized using the straight line method over their useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
the recoverability analysis includes estimates of future cash flows directly associated with and that are expected to arise as a direct result of the use and eventual disposition of the definite lived intangible asset 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the definite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value 
internal use software is amortized over a three to seven year period using the straight line method 
software maintenance and training costs are expensed as they are incurred 
marketing related intangible assets  which include trademarks  domain names and trade names are not amortized but are instead tested for impairment 
the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets is tested annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the intangible assets carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
in the recoverability analysis  the carrying amount of the asset is measured against the estimated discounted future cash flows associated with it 
should the sum of the expected future net cash flows be less than the carrying value of the asset being evaluated  an impairment loss would be recognized 
the impairment loss would be calculated as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value 
the company evaluated its intangible assets based on current economic and business indicators and determined they were not impaired 
income taxes deferred tax assets or liabilities are recorded to reflect the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and their tax basis at each year end 
these amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect enacted changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
the likelihood that deferred tax assets can be recovered must be assessed 
if recovery is not likely  the provision for taxes must be increased by recording a reserve in the form of a valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets that are estimated not to be ultimately recoverable 
in this process  certain relevant criteria are evaluated including the existence of deferred tax liabilities that can be used to absorb deferred tax assets and taxable income in future years 
judgment regarding future taxable income may change due to future market conditions  changes in laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to deferred tax assets and an accompanying reduction or increase in net income in the period when such determinations are made 
for additional information related to income taxes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
pension and other post employment benefits the company provides pension and other post employment benefits to many of our employees 
long term assumptions are developed to determine our employee benefit obligation  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and the health care cost trend rate 
for these assumptions  management consults with actuaries  monitors plan provisions and demographics  and reviews public market data and general economic information 
for additional information related to pension and other post employment benefits  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we determine our discount rate based on a range of factors  including a yield curve comprised of the rates of return on several hundred high quality  fixed income corporate bonds available on the measurement date for the related expected duration for the obligations  prepared by an independent third party 
the expected rate of return for the pension plan assets represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits are expected to be paid 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is developed from the expected future return on each asset class  weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class 
historical performance is considered for the types of assets in which the plan invests  independent market forecasts and economic and capital market considerations 
the healthcare cost trend rate as of december  was  declining to by for both pre and post age employees and retirees 

table of contents a sensitivity analysis of the impact on the expense income recorded for of a one percent change in our assumptions is shown in the table below pension health care and life in millions discount rate expected return on assets health care trend rate off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to our results of operation  financial condition or liquidity

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various types of market risk in the normal course of business 
in particular  we are subject to interest rate variability primarily associated with borrowings under our credit facilities 
as of december   the company had a balance of  million on the loan agreement with certain financial institutions 
the senior secured term loans bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at the company s option  either i the prime rate abr plus an applicable margin  or ii adjusted libor plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is for loans with interest rates determined by reference to abr and for loans with interest rates determined by reference to adjusted libor 
the senior secured term loans have a floor interest rate of in the case of abr and in the case of libor 
as long as interest rates remain at or below for abr and for libor  our minimum effective interest rate will be 
we performed an interest rate sensitivity analysis on our variable rate debt under our new capital structure 
with the libor floor of on our variable rate debt and a current libor rate of  an increase in libor rates of up to basis points would not affect our pre tax earnings 
an increase of basis points above the libor floor to would increase estimated interest expense by approximately million
