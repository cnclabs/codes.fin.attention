in addition  segment earnings include  of non cash impairment charges principally associated with residential development projects located near atlanta  georgia and fort worth  texas and with a commercial real estate project near the texas gulf coast 
mineral resources segment earnings declined principally due to decreased lease bonus revenues as a result of reduced leasing activity by exploration and production companies that are now concentrating investments in drilling activities to hold existing leases rather than leasing new mineral interests in our basins 
this decline in lease bonus revenue was partially offset by increased oil and natural gas production and higher oil prices  including our share of venture activity 
fiber resources segment earnings decreased principally due to reduced harvest activity resulting from the sale of over  acres of timberland in and and postponing harvest plans on about  acres classified as held for sale 
gain on sale of assets represents the sale of about  acres of timber and timberland in georgia  alabama and texas for  in accordance with our near term strategic initiatives

segment earnings were also negatively impacted by  in environmental remediation charges 
mineral resources segment earnings declined principally due to lower royalty revenues as result of lower natural gas and oil prices  and to a lesser extent  lower lease bonus revenues from decreased leasing activity and increased infrastructure costs associated with developing our mineral resources organization

interest expense decreased as result of lower debt levels 
real estate segment earnings were negatively impacted by decreased sales of residential lots  decreased commercial sales activity  increased costs associated with environmental remediation  and asset impairments 
mineral resources segment earnings benefited from bonus payments received for leasing over  net mineral acres 
mineral resources segment earnings also benefited from increased production volumes from new well activity and higher average oil and natural gas prices 
general and administrative expenses increased as a result of costs associated with the development of corporate functions as well as start up costs necessary as a stand alone public company 
share based compensation expense increased primarily due to accelerated expense recognition in conjunction with awards granted to retirement eligible employees and an increase in the number of participants in our plan

current market conditions current us market conditions in the single family residential industry continue to be difficult  characterized by depressed sales volumes and prices  increased foreclosures  high unemployment rates and low consumer confidence 
while all markets are being negatively affected by overall poor economic conditions  not all geographic areas and products have been affected to the same extent or with equal severity 
these difficult market conditions may continue throughout 
table of contents oil prices have increased partially due to tightening of international supply and anticipation that future demand will outpace supply growth as global economic activity improves 
natural gas prices have remained depressed as production remains strong and us domestic demand is lower resulting in increased inventory levels 
in our areas of operations  exploration and production companies remain focused on reducing capital expenditures for lease acquisition due to lower natural gas prices and drilling activity to hold existing leases 
these conditions may impact the demand for new mineral leases  new exploration activity and the amount of royalty revenues we receive 
pulpwood demand is relatively stable in our markets 
sawtimber prices remain depressed due to decreased demand for lumber as a result of lower new home construction activity

our venture partners also provide performance bonds and letters of credit 
generally these performance bonds or letters of credit would be drawn on due to lack of specific performance by us or the ventures  such as failure to deliver streets and utilities in accordance with local codes and ordinances 
at year end  we participate in three partnerships that have  of borrowings classified as current maturities 
these partnerships have total assets of  and other liabilities of  these partnerships are managed by third parties who intend to extend or refinance these borrowings  however  there is no assurance that this can be done 
although these borrowings may be guaranteed by third parties  we may under certain circumstances elect or be required to provide additional equity to these partnerships 
we do not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
our investment in these partnerships is  at year end these three partnerships are variable interest entities 
cibolo canyons san antonio  texas cibolo canyons consists of the jw marriott san antonio hill country resort spa development owned by third parties and a mixed use development we own 
we have about  invested in cibolo canyons at year end 
table of contents resort hotel  spa and golf development in  we entered into agreements to facilitate third party construction and ownership of the jw marriott san antonio hill country resort spa  which includes a  room destination resort and two pga tour tournament players club tpc golf courses 
under these agreements  we agreed to transfer to third party owners about acres of undeveloped land  to provide about  cash and to provide approximately  of other consideration principally consisting of golf course construction materials  substantially all of which has been provided 
in exchange for our commitment to the resort  the third party owners assigned to us certain rights under an agreement between the third party owners and a legislatively created special purpose improvement district spid 
this agreement includes the right to receive from the spid percent of hotel occupancy revenues and percent of other resort sales revenues collected as taxes by the spid through the amount we receive will be net of annual ad valorem tax reimbursements by the spid to the third party owners of the resort through in addition  these payments will be net of debt service  if any  on bonds issued by the spid collateralized by hotel occupancy tax and other resort sales tax receipts through the amounts we collect under this agreement are dependent on several factors including the amount of revenues generated by and ad valorem taxes imposed on the resort and the amount of any applicable debt service incurred by the spid 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to the amount and timing of collections under this agreement 
until these uncertainties are clarified  amounts collected under the agreement will be accounted for as a reduction of our investment in the resort development 
the resort began operations in january in fourth quarter  we received approximately  from the spid related to our share of hotel occupancy revenues and other resort sales revenues collected as taxes by the spid in we accounted for this as a reduction of our investment 
at year end  we have  invested in the resort development 
in fourth quarter  we received payment in full plus interest for the  loan to a third party equity investor in the resort development which was funded in first quarter mixed use development the mixed use development we own consists of  acres planned to include about  residential lots and about commercial acres designated for multifamily and retail uses  of which lots and commercial acres have been sold through year end in  we entered into an agreement with the spid providing for reimbursement of certain infrastructure costs related to the mixed use development 
reimbursements are subject to review and approval by the spid and unreimbursed amounts accrue interest at percent 
the spid s funding for reimbursements is principally derived from its ad valorem tax collections and bond proceeds collateralized by ad valorem taxes  less debt service on these bonds and annual administrative and public service expenses 
through year end  we have submitted and received approval for reimbursement of about  of infrastructure costs and have received reimbursements totaling  of which  was received in and  was received in at year end  we have  in approved and pending reimbursements  excluding interest 
since the amount of each reimbursement is dependent on several factors  including timing of spid approval and the spid having an adequate tax base to generate funds that can be used to reimburse us  there is uncertainty as to the amount and timing of reimbursements under this agreement 
we expect to recover our investment from lot and tract sales and reimbursement of approved infrastructure costs from the spid 
we have not recognized income from interest due  but not collected 
as these uncertainties are clarified  we will modify our accounting accordingly 
at year end  we have  invested in the mixed use development 

table of contents accounting policies critical accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements  we follow generally accepted accounting principles  which in many cases require us to make assumptions  estimates  and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
our significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
many of these principles are relatively straightforward 
there are  however  a few accounting policies that are critical because they are important in determining our financial condition and results of operations and involve significant assumptions  estimates and judgments that are difficult to determine 
we must make these assumptions  estimates and judgments currently about matters that are inherently uncertain  such as future economic conditions  operating results and valuations  as well as our intentions 
as the difficulty increases  the level of precision decreases  meaning actual results can  and probably will  differ from those currently estimated 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on a combination of historical experiences and other factors that we believe are reasonable 
we have reviewed the selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with our audit committee 
investment in real estate and cost of real estate sales in allocating costs to real estate owned and real estate sold  we must estimate current and future real estate values 
our estimates of future real estate values sometimes must extend over periods to years from today and are dependent on numerous assumptions including our intentions and future market and economic conditions 
in addition  when we sell real estate from projects that are not finished  we must estimate future development costs through completion 
differences between our estimates and actual results will affect future carrying values and operating results 
impairment of long lived assets measuring assets for impairment requires estimating future fair values based on our intentions as to holding periods  future operating cash flows and the residual value of assets under review  primarily undeveloped land 
depending on the asset under review  we use varying methods to determine fair value  such as discounting expected future cash flows  determining resale values by market  or applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
changes in economic conditions  demand for real estate  and the projected net operating income for a specific property will inevitably change our estimates 
share based compensation we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables 
these variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors term of option  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we have limited historical experience as a stand alone company so we utilized alternative methods in determining our valuation assumptions 
the expected life was based on the simplified method utilizing the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual life of the awards 
the expected stock price volatility was based on historical prices of our peers common stock for a period corresponding to the expected life of the options 
pre vesting forfeitures are estimated based upon the pool of participants and their expected activity and historical trends 
income taxes in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary and permanent differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
if needed  we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
in addition  when we believe a tax position is supportable but the outcome uncertain  we include the item in our tax return but do not recognize the related benefit in our provision for taxes 
instead  we record a reserve for unrecognized tax benefits  which represents our expectation of the most likely outcome considering the technical merits and specific facts of the position 
changes to liabilities are only made when an event occurs that changes the most likely outcome  such as settlement with the relevant tax authority  expiration of statutes of 
table of contents limitations  changes in tax law  or recent court rulings 
adjustments to temporary differences  permanent differences or uncertain tax positions could materially impact our financial position  cash flow and results of operation 
oil and natural gas reserves the estimation of the oil and natural gas reserve is a significant estimate 
on an annual basis  our consulting petroleum engineering firm  with our assistance  prepares estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves based on available geologic and seismic data  reservoir pressure data  core analysis reports  well logs  analogous reservoir performance history  production data and other available sources of engineering  geological and geophysical information 
oil and natural gas prices are volatile and largely affected by worldwide or domestic production and consumption and are outside our control 
adopted and pending accounting pronouncements we adopted four new accounting pronouncements in  the adoption of which did not have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
there are two pending accounting pronouncements that we will be required to adopt in and adoption is not anticipated to have a significant effect on our earnings or financial position 
please read note new accounting pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements 
effects of inflation inflation has had minimal effects on operating results the past three years 
our real estate  timber  and property and equipment are carried at historical costs 
if carried at current replacement costs  the cost of real estate sold  timber cut  and depreciation expense would have been significantly higher than what we reported 
legal proceedings we are involved in various legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of doing business 
we believe we have established adequate reserves for any probable losses  and we do not believe that the outcome of any of these proceedings should have a material adverse effect on our financial position  long term results of operations  or cash flow 
it is possible  however  that charges related to these matters could be significant to results of operations or cash flows in any one accounting period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our interest rate risk is principally related to our variable rate debt 
interest rate changes impact earnings due to the resulting increase or decrease in our variable rate debt  which was  at year end and  at year end in  our outstanding variable rate debt includes the effect of a  notional amount interest rate swap  which matured on march  the following table illustrates the estimated effect on our pre tax income of immediate  parallel  and sustained shifts in interest rates for the next months on our variable rate debt at year end  with comparative year end information 
this estimate assumes that debt reductions from contractual payments will be replaced with short term  variable rate debt  however  that may not be the financing alternative we choose 
at year end change in interest rates in thousands
