net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the increase in net interest income was due to the increase in average earning assets as well as the net interest margin 
average earning assets increased million while the net interest margin for was  up basis points from during  loan yields remained stable as the prime rate remained unchanged for a large amount of our variable rate loans 
we were able to reduce our cost of deposits through our active deposit pricing management and a shift toward lower cost core deposits from higher costing cds and wholesale funding compared to the yield on interest earning assets only declined by basis points  and loan yields declined only basis points  while the yield on interest bearing liabilities declined by basis points 
net interest income increased million  or  to million in compared to million in the net interest margin for was  up basis points from these increases were the result of our growth in core deposits which improved our funding mix combined with active management of deposit and wholesale pricing 
in comparison to  the yield on interest bearing liabilities declined by  while the yield on interest earning assets declined by only due to ongoing loan pricing management 
also  contributing to the increase in net interest income was an increase in our mortgage backed securities mbs portfolio during  due to purchases made throughout the year to take advantage of market opportunity and optimize our capital position 
in addition  the yield on our loan portfolio remained relatively stable 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding changes in net interest income attributable to changes in the volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and changes in the rates for the periods indicated

includes reverse mortgages provision for loan losses 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at an appropriate level based on our assessment of the estimable and probable losses in the loan portfolio  which is discussed further in the nonperforming assets section of this management s discussion and analysis 
our evaluation is based upon a review of the portfolio and requires significant judgment 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for loan losses of million compared to million in and million in the provision of million is a million decrease from this was the result of asset quality stabilizing and key lending indicators  such as problem loan levels  improving 
also  this decline is indicative of the current point in the business cycle  as problem loans decline and reserves built in prior quarters for the resolution of previously identified problem loans which have now become confirmed losses 
noninterest income 
noninterest income was essentially flat at million in compared to million for the million decrease in loan fees in was mainly attributable to the wind down of st reverse financial services  llc during as a result we did not record any loan fees from this business in in addition  net gains on sales of securities decreased by million in compared to  but still reflect million of net gains in despite the sale of nearly all of our downgraded mbs 
increases in several items essentially offset these decreases  including an increase of million in credit debit card and atm income during this increase was primarily due to growth in prime based bailment fees at cash connect our atm division 
in addition  fiduciary and investment management income increased million during resulting from our acquisition of cb t in the fourth quarter of as well as growth of our existing wealth management and investment businesses during the year 
noninterest income increased million to million in  or  from million in a significant amount of this increase was due to securities gains  which increased million during these security gains included million of incremental mark to market adjustments on the bbb mbs  as we recognized positive adjustments of million during compared with negative adjustments of million in the securities gains increase also included million in gains from the sale of securities during partially offsetting these increases was the absence of any gains on the sale of visa  inc shares in during we recognized million in gains on sale of visa  inc shares related to the completion of their initial public offering 
in addition to securities gains  mortgage banking activities increased million due to increased mortgage loan originations and sales  including a million bulk loan sale completed during also during  loan fee income increased million as a result of increased fees from st reverse  our majority owned national reverse mortgage subsidiary 
the wind down of st reverse was completed in the fourth quarter of these noninterest income increases were partially offset by a reduction in boli income of  due to lower yields in underlying investments funding this program and a  decrease in credit debit card and atm income which was the result of reduced prime based atm bailment fees from cash connect resulting from the lower interest rate environment 
although noninterest income was negatively impacted by lower bailment fees  the net interest margin benefited due to lower funding costs for these borrowings 
noninterest expenses 
noninterest expenses increased only  during compared to during there were million of non routine items compared to million during for additional detail on these non routine items see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the non routine items  the remaining increase in expenses was the result of higher fdic expense during mainly due to increased deposit balances during the year 
in addition  loan workout and other real estate owned oreo expenses increased  as we continued our active asset disposition efforts and prudent write downs to expected realizable values 
otherwise  increases in expense items reflect the thoughtful and aggressive growth efforts we have taken to pursue the significant opportunities in our market 
examples of this growth are increased expenses related to the ongoing operations of christiana trust as well as the addition of eight new relationship mangers and the related support staff during the past year 
further  during we completed five new  relocated or renovated branch offices  as well as preparation for several additional or renovated offices during as we continue our expansion plans  additional costs for associates  infrastructure and marketing are anticipated in noninterest expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in a large portion of the increase is attributable to million of non routine items recorded during for additional information on any of these non routine items see note to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the non routine items  the remaining increase was mainly due to an additional million of fdic insurance premium expense during also during  write downs of assets acquired through foreclosure reo and other credit related costs increased million related to additional deterioration in housing prices and appraisal values 
further  during professional fees increased million mainly due to increased credit related issues 
in addition  the increase in professional fees included a million accrual of consulting expenses related the company s efficiency effort creative opportunities for revenues and expenses core program 
this expense accrual was for the portion of the consultant s work that was completed 
lastly  salaries benefits and other compensation as well as occupancy and equipment expenses increased million due to the continued growth of our banking franchise during this growth included the full year impact of seven branch openings and renovations during including four branches from sun national bank and an additional two new branches and two branch relocations during income taxes 
we recorded million of tax expense for the year ended december  compared to a tax benefit of million and tax expense million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the effective tax rates for the years ended december   and were  and  respectively 
the tax benefit is a result of our pre tax operating loss  combined with tax free income and a reduction in unrecognized tax benefits during the year 
volatility in effective tax rates is directly impacted by the level of pretax income or loss  combined with the amount of tax free income as well as the effects of unrecognized tax benefits 
the provision for income taxes includes federal  state and local income taxes that are currently payable or deferred because of temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax reporting basis of the assets and liabilities 
financial condition total assets increased million  or  to billion as december  compared to december  a significant portion of this increase was due to growth in net loans of million  or  during loan growth was impacted by the acquisition of cb t  including million of loans 
in addition  cash in non owned atms and our mortgage backed securities increased million and million  respectively 
total liabilities increased million during the year to billion at december  this increase was primarily the result of an increase in customer deposits of million  or  including million of customer deposits from the acquisition of cb t

loan growth counting the cb t loans included increases of million  or  and million  or  in commercial and commercial real estate loans  respectively 
these increases were partially offset by the intentional decline of million  or  in construction loan balances during in addition  residential mortgage loans decreased by million  or  mainly due to our strategy to originate then sell these loans in the secondary market to generate fee income

partially offsetting these increases were cash dividends on common and preferred stock of million 
asset liability management our primary asset liability management goal is to maximize long term net interest income opportunities within the constraints of managing interest rate risk  while ensuring adequate liquidity and funding and maintaining a strong capital base 
in general  interest rate risk is mitigated by closely matching the maturities or repricing periods of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to ensure a favorable interest rate spread 
we regularly review our interest rate sensitivity  and use a variety of strategies as needed to adjust that sensitivity within acceptable tolerance ranges established by management and the board of directors 
changing the relative proportions of fixed rate and adjustable rate assets and liabilities is one of our primary strategies to accomplish this objective 
the matching of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring an institution s interest sensitivity gap 
an interest sensitivity gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing within a defined period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets repricing within a defined period 
the repricing and maturities of our interest rate sensitive assets and interest rate sensitive liabilities at december  are shown in the following table less than one to over total one year five years five years dollars in thousands interest rate sensitive assets real estate loans commercial loans consumer loans mortgage backed securities loans held for sale investment securities interest bearing deposits in other banks interest rate sensitive liabilities money market and interest bearing demand deposits savings deposits retail time deposits jumbo certificates of deposit brokered certificates of deposit fhlb advances trust preferred borrowings other borrowed funds deficiency excess of interest rate sensitive assets over interest rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitive gap one year interest rate sensitive assets interest rate sensitive liabilities one year interest rate sensitive gap as a percent of total assets includes commercial mortgage  construction  and residential mortgage loans loan balances exclude nonaccruing loans  deferred fees and costs generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would result in an increase in net interest income while a negative gap would adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling rates  a positive gap would result in a decrease in net interest income while a negative gap would augment net interest income 
however  the interest sensitivity table does not provide a comprehensive representation of the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
each category of assets or liabilities will not be affected equally or simultaneously by changes in the general level of interest rates 
even assets and liabilities which contractually reprice within the rate period may not  in fact  reprice at the same price or the same time or with the same frequency 
it is also important to consider that the table represents a specific point in time 
variations can occur as we adjust our interest sensitivity position throughout the year 
to provide a more accurate position of our one year gap  certain deposit classifications are based on the interest rate sensitive attributes and not on the contractual repricing characteristics of these deposits 
we estimate  based on historical trends of our deposit accounts  that of our money market and of our interest bearing demand deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes and that of our savings deposits are sensitive to interest rate changes 
accordingly  these interest sensitive portions are classified in the less than one year category with the remainder in the over five year category 
deposit rates other than time deposit rates are variable  and changes in deposit rates are generally subject to local market conditions and our discretion and are not indexed to any particular rate 
during the first quarter of we executed on million of intermediate term fhlb advances in order to reduce the sensitivity of our net interest income to increases in market interest rates 
reverse mortgages we hold an investment in reverse mortgages of  at december  representing a participation in reverse mortgages with a third party 
sixteen loans remain in this portfolio 
the loans were originated in the early s 
these reverse mortgage loans are contracts that require the lender to make monthly advances throughout each borrower s life or until each borrower relocates  prepays or the home is sold  at which time the loan becomes due and payable 
reverse mortgages are nonrecourse obligations  which means that the loan repayments are generally limited to the net sale proceeds of the borrower s residence 
we account for our investment in reverse mortgages by estimating the value of the future cash flows on the reverse mortgages at a discount rate deemed appropriate for these mortgages  based on the market rate for similar collateral 
actual cash flows from the maturity of these mortgage loans can result in significant volatility in the recorded value of reverse mortgage assets 
as a result  income varies significantly from reporting period to reporting period 
for the year ended december   we recorded a negative  in interest income on reverse mortgages 
for the year ended december   we recorded a negative  in interest income on reverse mortgages  and we recorded a negative million in the results for all three years were primarily due to the decrease in the values of the properties securing the mortgages  based on annual re evaluations and consistent with the decrease in home values over the past three years 
the projected cash flows depend on assumptions about life expectancy of the mortgagees and the future changes in collateral values 
projecting the changes in collateral values is the most significant factor impacting the volatility of reverse mortgage values 
our current assumptions include a short term annual appreciation rate of zero in the first year  and a long term annual appreciation rate of in future years 
if the long term appreciation rate was increased to  the resulting impact would have resulted in income of  conversely  if the long term appreciation rate was decreased to  the resulting impact on income would have been a loss of  if housing values do not change annual appreciation for all future years the resulting impact would be a loss of less than  we hold million fair value of bbb rated mortgage backed securities classified as trading 
we also have options to acquire up to of class o certificates issued in connection with securities consisting of a portfolio of reverse mortgages we previously owned 
the class o certificates are currently recorded on our financial statements at a zero value 
at the time of the securitization  the third party securitizer lehman brothers holding  inc lehman brothers retained of the class o certificates from the securitization 
these class o certificates have no priority over other classes of certificates under the trust and no distributions will be made on the class o certificates until  among other conditions  the principal amount of each other class of notes has been reduced to zero 
the underlying assets  the reverse mortgages  are very long term assets 
therefore  any cash flow that might inure to the holder of the class o certificates is not expected to occur until a number of years in the future 
additionally  we have had the ability to exercise our option on of the class o certificates in up to five separate increments for an aggregate purchase price of million any time between january  and the termination of the securitization trust 
the option to purchase the class o certificates does not meet the definition of a derivative under asu  derivatives and hedging formerly statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosure about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
and is carried in our financial statements at cost 
in lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy 
during we filed a proof of claim against lehman brothers holding  inc regarding the option on the class o certificates 
also during we notified lehman brothers holding  inc that we were exercising our option on these securities 
while the status of this exercise is still pending  during we entered into negotiations with the bankruptcy estate to fully resolve this claim 
during  we acquired a majority interest in st reverse financial services  llc st reverse  which specializes in originating and subsequently selling reverse mortgage loans nationwide 
these reverse mortgages are government approved and insured 
during the latter part of  we decided to conduct an orderly wind down of st reverse operations discussed further in note of the financial statements 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  which include nonaccruing loans  nonperforming real estate investments and assets acquired through foreclosure and troubled debt restructures  can negatively affect our results of operations 
nonaccruing loans are those on which the accrual of interest has ceased 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status immediately if  in the opinion of management  collection is doubtful  or when principal or interest is past due days or more and the value of the collateral is insufficient to cover principal and interest 
interest accrued but not collected at the date a loan is placed on nonaccrual status is reversed and charged against interest income 
in addition  the amortization of net deferred loan fees is suspended when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
subsequent cash receipts are applied either to the outstanding principal balance or recorded as interest income  depending on management s assessment of the ultimate collectability of principal and interest 
past due loans are defined as loans contractually past due days or more as to principal or interest payments but which remain in accrual status because they are considered well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table shows our nonperforming assets and past due loans at the dates indicated at december  dollars in thousands nonaccruing loans commercial mortgages construction commercial residential mortgages consumer total nonaccruing loans assets acquired through foreclosure restructured loans total nonperforming assets past due loans residential mortgages commercial and commercial mortgages consumer total past due loans ratio of nonaccruing loans to total loans ratio of allowance for loan losses to gross loans ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets ratio of loan loss allowance to nonaccruing loans nonaccruing tdrs are included in their respective categories of nonaccruing loans 
total loans exclude loans held for sale 
the applicable allowance represents general valuation allowances only 
nonperforming assets increased million between december  and december  as a result nonperforming assets  as a ratio of total assets  increased to at december  an increase of over the as of december  a reduction in nonperforming construction loans of million was more than offset by increases in nonperforming commercial  commercial mortgage and retail loans of million 
the increase was mainly due to the migration of small business loans and reflects the impact the current ongoing economic downturn is having on small business customers 
the decrease in nonperforming construction loans was a result of proactive credit management as we emphasized problem asset resolution 
assets acquired through foreclosure increased slightly to million at december  compared to million at december  while we have added significant resources  proactively managed resolution of problem assets and have seen leading indicators continue to improve during the fourth quarter of  the level of nonperforming assets is expected to continue to show volatility 
all of the accruing restructured loans were residential mortgages and consumer loans 
concessions on these loans consisted mainly of forbearance agreements  reduction in interest rates or extensions of maturity 
there were million of restructured loans included in nonaccruing loan balances all in construction loans 
nonaccruing restructured loans remain in nonaccrual status until there has been a period of sustained historical repayment performance for a reasonable period  usually six months 
the following table provides an analysis of the change in the balance of nonperforming assets during the last three years year ended december in thousands beginning balance additions collections transfers to accrual charge offs write downs ending balance as of december   we had million of loans  which although performing at that date  required increased supervision and review  and may  depending on the economic environment and other factors  become nonperforming assets in future periods 
the amount of such loans at december  was million 
the majority of these loans are secured by commercial real estate  with others being secured by residential real estate  inventory and receivables 
at december   we did not have a material amount of loans not classified as non accrual  days past due or restructured but where known information about possible credit problems of borrowers caused us to have serious concerns as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with present loan repayment terms and may result in disclosure as non accrual  days past due or restructured 
allowance for loan losses 
we maintain allowances for loan losses and charge losses to these allowances when such losses are realized 
the determination of the allowance for loan losses requires significant judgment reflecting our best estimate of impairment related to specifically identified loans as well as probable loan losses in the remaining loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon a continuing review of these portfolios 
we established our loan loss allowance in accordance with guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin sab 
its methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements which include specific allowances for identified problem loans  formula allowances for commercial and commercial real estate loans  and allowances for pooled homogenous loans 
specific reserves are established when appropriate for certain loans in cases where we have identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a specific credit that we believe indicate the loan is impaired 
the formula allowances for commercial loans are calculated by applying estimated loss factors to outstanding loans based on the internal risk grade of loans 
for low risk commercial and commercial real estate loans the portfolio is pooled  based on internal risk grade  and  as a starting point  estimates are based on a ten year net charge off history 
higher risk and criticized loans have loss factors that are derived from an analysis of both the probability of default and the probability of loss should default occur 
loss adjustment factors are then applied to the historical data based on criteria discussed below 
as a result  changes in risk grades of both performing and nonperforming loans affect the amount of the formula allowance 
pooled loans are usually smaller  not individually graded and homogenous in nature  such as consumer installment loans and residential mortgages 
loan loss allowances for pooled loans are first based on a ten year net charge off history 
the average loss allowance per homogenous pool is based on the product of the average annual historical loss rate and the homogeneous pool balances 
these separate risk pools are then assigned a reserve for losses based upon this historical loss information and loss adjustment factors 
adjustments to historical losses are based upon our evaluation of various current conditions including those listed below general economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas credit quality trends recent loss experience in particular segments of the portfolio collateral values and loan to value ratios loan volumes and concentrations  including changes in mix seasoning of the loan portfolio specific industry conditions within portfolio segments bank regulatory examination results other factors  including changes in quality of the loan origination  servicing and risk management processes our loan officers and risk managers meet at least quarterly to discuss and review the conditions and risks associated with individual loans 
we also have an internal loan review function that oversees and examines management s internal ratings 
we have an internal loan rating system with twelve categories of loan ratings  which is used to evaluate our commercial loans 
these categories are discussed later in this note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  we regularly contract with third party loan review experts to review portions of the portfolio 
further  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review our allowance for such losses 
we also give consideration to the results of these regulatory agency examinations 
increases in the allowance for loan losses in compared to prior periods and were due to rising trends in our past due and nonperforming loans and the effects of rising unemployment rates 
the increase in non performing loans is a direct result of the weak economic environment impacting numerous borrowers ability to pay as scheduled 
this has resulted in increased loan delinquencies over the economic cycle and  in some cases  decreases in the collateral value used to secure real estate loans and the ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
collateral value is assessed based on third party appraisals  collateral value trends and liquidation value trends 
in certain circumstances  the appraised value may be adjusted based upon the consideration of the age of the appraisal and other liquidation expenses to determine appropriate discounts that may be needed 
in response to the deterioration in real estate loan quality over this cycle  management closely monitors this portfolio 
a loan is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect principal or interest that is due in accordance with contractual terms of the loan 
impaired loans include nonaccrual loans and troubled debt restructured loans 
loan impairment is measured in accordance with fasb asc  receivables formerly sfas no 
 accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan 
the adjustments are made in the form of specific reserves and or charge offs 
additional information regarding the specific reserves can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the table below represents a summary of changes in the allowance for loan losses during the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands beginning balance provision for loan losses charge offs commercial mortgage construction commercial residential real estate overdrafts consumer total charge offs recoveries commercial mortgage construction commercial residential real estate overdrafts consumer total recoveries net charge offs ending balance net charge offs to average gross loans outstanding  net of unearned income during  net charge offs increased to million  or  of average loans annualized  from million  or  of average loans in this is due to the fact that we provide for losses earlier in the problem loan identification process when they are probable 
we charge the loans off when they are determined to be uncollectable 
the allowance for loan losses is allocated by major portfolio type 
as these portfolios have developed  they have become a source of historical data in projecting delinquencies and loss exposure 
however  such allocations are not a guarantee of when future losses may occur 
while we have allocated the allowance for loan losses by portfolio type in the following table  the entire reserve is available for any loan portfolio to utilize

historically  we have had success in growing our loan portfolio 
for example  during the year ended december   net loan growth resulted in the use of million in cash 
loan growth excluding the cb t acquisition was primarily the result of our continued success increasing corporate and small business lending 
we expect this trend to continue and have significant experience managing our funding needs through borrowings and deposit growth 
as a financial institution  we have ready access to several sources of funding 
among these are deposit growth brokered deposits borrowing from the fhlb fed discount window access other borrowings such as repurchase agreements cash flow from securities  loan sales and repayments net income 
our current branch expansion and renovation program is focused on expanding our retail footprint in delaware and attracting new customers to provide additional deposit growth 
customer funding growth was strong  equaling million  or between december  and december  nearly all of this growth was in core deposit accounts and included a million increase from the cb t acquisition 
our portfolio of high quality liquid investments  primarily short duration  mortgage backed securities and gse securities also provide a source of cash flow to meet current cash needs 
if needed  portions of this portfolio  as well as portions of the loan portfolio  could be sold to provide cash to fund new loans 
in addition  during the year ended december   million in cash was provided by operating activities 
we have a policy that separately addresses liquidity  and we monitor our adherence to policy limits 
as part of the liquidity management process  we also monitor our available wholesale funding capacity 
at december   we had million in funding capacity at the federal home loan bank of pittsburgh 
also  liquidity risk management is a primary area of examination by the ots 
we have not used and have no intention of using any significant off balance sheet financing arrangement for liquidity management purposes 
our financial instruments with off balance sheet risk are limited to obligations to fund loans to customers pursuant to existing commitments and obligations of letters of credit 
in addition  we have not had and have no intention to have any significant transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated  limited purpose entities that could materially affect our liquidity or capital resources 
capital resources federal laws  among other things  require the ots to mandate uniformly applicable capital standards for all savings institutions 
these standards currently require institutions such as us to maintain a tangible capital ratio equal to of adjusted total assets  core or leverage capital equal to of adjusted total assets 
tier capital equal to of risk weighted assets and total risk based capital a combination of core and supplementary capital equal to of risk weighted assets 
the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  as well as other requirements  established five capital tiers well capitalized  adequately capitalized  under capitalized  significantly under capitalized  and critically under capitalized 
a depository institution s capital tier depends upon its capital levels in relation to various relevant capital measures  which include leverage and risk based capital measures and certain other factors 
depository institutions that are not classified as well capitalized are subject to various restrictions regarding capital distributions  payment of management fees  acceptance of brokered deposits and other operating activities 
at december   we are classified as well capitalized  the highest regulatory defined level  and in compliance with all regulatory capital requirements 
additional information concerning our regulatory capital compliance is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
since  the board of directors has approved several stock repurchase programs to acquire common stock outstanding 
we did not acquire any shares in or at december   we held million shares of our common stock as treasury shares 
at december   we had  shares remaining under our current share repurchase authorization 
on january   under the us treasury s capital purchase plan cpp  we issued and sold  shares of senior preferred stock to the us treasury  having a liquidation amount equal to  per share  or million 
although we were well capitalized under regulatory guidelines  the board of directors believed it was advisable to take advantage of the cpp to raise additional capital to ensure that  during these uncertain times  we are well positioned to support our existing operations as well as anticipated future growth 
additional information concerning the cpp is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
as part of the cpp program  any share repurchases or increase in the dividend level from the september quarterly payment of per share  must be approved by the us treasury 
we completed a private placement to peninsula investment partners  lp peninsula on september   pursuant to which we issued and sold  shares of common stock for a total purchase price of million  and a year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
additional information concerning the peninsula transaction is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in august  we completed an underwritten public offering of  shares of common stock 
the offering was priced at per share  a slight premium to the prior day s closing price  and raised million  net of million of costs

contractual obligations at december   we had contractual obligations relating to operating leases  long term debt  data processing and credit obligations 
these obligations are summarized below 
see notes  and to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
total less than years years more than year years in thousands operating lease obligations long term debt obligations data processing contracts credit obligations total impact of inflation and changing prices our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration of the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of our operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or the same extent as the price of goods and services 
recent legislation the economy is experiencing significantly reduced business activity as a result of  among other factors  disruptions in the financial system during the past year 
declines in the housing market during the past year  due to falling home prices and increased foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in substantial declines in mortgage related asset values  which has had a dramatic negative impact on government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
reflecting concern about the stability of the finance markets in general and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased  to provide funding and liquidity to borrowers  including other financial institutions 
in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets and going concern threats to investment banks and other financial institutions  on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa was signed into law 
pursuant to the eesa  specifically the troubled asset relief program tarp thereunder  the us treasury will have the authority to  among other things  purchase up to billion of mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the secretary of the department of the treasury announced the department of the treasury would purchase equity stakes in a wide variety of banks and thrifts through tarp s cpp 
under this program  from the billion authorized by the eesa  the treasury made billion of capital available to us financial institutions in the form of preferred stock as a way for healthy us financial institutions to help stabilize the us economy 
in conjunction with the purchase of preferred stock  the treasury received  from participating financial institutions  warrants to purchase common stock with an aggregate market price equal to of the preferred stock investment 
participating financial institutions were required to adopt the treasury s standards for executive compensation and corporate governance for the period during which the treasury holds equity in such institution issued under the cpp 
after careful consideration of all the costs  restrictions  risks and benefits  we have elected to participate in the cpp program 
the treasury s investment signals their faith in us as a healthy institution that can help stabilize and eventually grow the economy

on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law by president obama 
the arra includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
in addition  the arra imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients until the institution has repaid the us treasury  which is now permitted under the arra without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the us treasury s consultation with the recipient s appropriate regulatory agency 
on november   the fdic adopted a final ruling that required banks to prepay their estimated quarterly risk based assessments for the th quarter of and for all of through in addition the fdic board voted to adopt a uniform three basis point increase in assessment rates effective january  prepayment of the assessments allowed the industry to strengthen the cash position of the deposit insurance fund dif immediately while allowing the capital impact to be felt over time as the industry s financial condition improves

on july   the president signed the dodd frank act into law 
this legislation makes extensive changes to the laws regulating financial services firms and requires significant rule making 
in addition  the legislation mandates multiple studies  which could result in additional legislative or regulatory action 
while the full effects of the legislation on us cannot yet be determined  this legislation was opposed by the american bankers association and is generally perceived as negatively impacting the banking industry 
this legislation may result in higher compliance and other costs  reduced revenues and higher capital and liquidity requirements  among other things  which could adversely affect our business 
there are many parts of the dodd frank act that have yet to be determined and implemented however  as a direct result of the act  the following rulings have been adopted or will be adopted in the coming years on august  the board of directors of the fdic adopted a final ruling permanently increasing the standard maximum deposit insurance amount from  to  which became effective on july  during january of  a timeframe and preliminary implementation plan for the phase out of the office of thrift supervision the ots  one of our current banking regulators was announced by the joint agencies  and its merger into the office of the comptroller of the currency

on february   the federal reserve approved a final ruling the changes the deposit insurance fund dif assessment from domestic deposits to average assets minus tangible equity 
the changes will go into effect during the second quarter of and will be payable at the end of september 
it is the intent of the fdic that banks with over billion in assets pay a larger share of the assessments into the dif 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on the consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions affecting the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
we regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions including those related to the allowance for loan losses  deferred taxes  fair value measurements  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors and assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these form the basis for making judgments on the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following are critical accounting policies that involve more significant judgments and estimates allowance for loan losses we maintain allowances for loan losses and charge losses to these allowances when realized 
we consider the determination of the allowance for loan losses to be critical because it requires significant judgment reflecting our best estimate of impairment related to specifically evaluated impaired loans as well as the inherent risk of loss for those in the remaining loan portfolio 
our evaluation is based upon a continuing review of the portfolio  with consideration given to evaluations resulting from examinations performed by regulatory authorities 
deferred taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  income taxes asc  which requires the recording of deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we consider our accounting policies on deferred taxes to be critical because we regularly assess the need for valuation allowances on deferred income tax assets that may result from  among other things  limitations imposed by internal revenue code and uncertainties  including the timing of settlement and realization of these differences 
no valuation allowance is required as of december  fair value measurements we adopted fasb asc fair value measurements and disclosures asc  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we consider our accounting policies related to fair value measurements to be critical because they are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require our subjective and complex judgment as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
see note  fair value of financial assets to our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with fasb asc  business combinations  and fasb asc  intangibles goodwill and other  all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill  indefinite lived intangibles and other intangibles are recorded at fair value 
we consider our accounting policies related to goodwill and other intangible assets to be critical because the assumptions or judgment used in determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired in past acquisitions are subjective and complex 
as a result  changes in these assumptions or judgment could have a significant impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  including the resulting goodwill  was based either on quoted market prices or provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information was not available we made good faith estimates primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
the assumptions used in the cash flow modeling are subjective and susceptible to significant changes 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually and written down and charged to results of operations only in periods in which the recorded value is more than the estimated fair value 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are periodically evaluated for impairment 
as of december   goodwill totaled million compared to million as of december  the majority of this goodwill is in the wsfs bank reporting unit and is the result of a branch acquisition in and the acquisition of cb t during in addition  and mainly as a result of the cb t acquisition  amortizing intangibles totaled million as of december  compared to million as of december  goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step process that begins with an estimation of fair value 
the first step compares the estimated fair value of our reporting units with their carrying amounts  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired 
however  if the carrying amount exceeds its estimated fair value  a second step is performed comparing the implied fair value to the carrying amount of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
fair value may be determined using market prices  comparison to similar assets  market multiples  discounted cash flow analyses and other variables 
estimated cash flows extend five years into the future and  by their nature  are difficult to estimate over such an extended period of time 
factors that may significantly affect estimates include  but are not limited to  balance sheet growth assumptions  credit losses in our investment and loan portfolios  competitive pressures in our market area  changes in customer base and customer product preferences  changes in revenue growth trends  cost structure  changes in discount rates  conditions in the banking sector and general economic variables 
as of december   we completed the step one test of the analysis to determine potential goodwill impairment of the wsfs bank reporting unit 
the valuation incorporated a market based analysis and indicated the fair value of our wsfs bank reporting unit was above the carrying amount 
therefore  in accordance with fasb asc  the step two analysis was not required 
at december   goodwill and other intangible assets were not considered impaired 
changing economic conditions that may adversely affect our performance and stock price could result in impairment  which could adversely affect earnings in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in june the fasb issued new guidance impacting fasb asc  transfers and servicing asc formerly sfas no 
 accounting for transfers of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 

this new standard amended derecognition guidance and eliminated the concept of qualifying special purpose entities 
the new standard was effective on january  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued new guidance impacting fasb asc  consolidation formerly sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r 
the new standard amended previous guidance to replace the quantitative based risks and rewards calculation for determining which enterprise  if any  has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity with an approach focused on identifying which enterprise has the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and i the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or ii the right to receive benefits from the entity 
the pronouncement was effective january  and we have determined that adoption of the new standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued an update accounting standards update no 
 receivables  disclosures about the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses this update improves the disclosures that an entity provides about the credit quality of its financing receivables and the related allowance for credit losses 
as a result of these amendments  an entity is required to disaggregate  by portfolio segment or class  certain existing disclosures  and to provide certain new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowances for credit losses 
the disclosures as of the end of a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending on or after december  the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning on or after december  the amendment does not require comparative disclosures for earlier reporting periods that ended before adoption  however  an entity should provide comparative disclosures for those reporting periods after initial adoption 
the adoption of this amendment did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued an update accounting standards update no 
 business combinations disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations which amends fasb asc  business combination

a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value 
the new standard is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements which is not effective until reporting periods beginning after december  adoption of this guidance is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued an update accounting standards update no 
 receivables which temporarily delays the effective date of the disclosures about trouble debt restructurings in update for public entities

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the matching of maturities or repricing periods of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to promote a favorable interest rate spread and mitigate exposure to fluctuations in interest rates is our primary tool for achieving our asset liability management strategies 
we regularly review our interest rate sensitivity and adjust the sensitivity within our acceptable tolerance ranges 
at december  interest earning assets exceeded interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice within one year interest sensitive gap by million 
our interest sensitive assets as a percentage of interest sensitive liabilities within one year increased from at december  to at december  likewise  the one year interest sensitive gap as a percentage of total assets changed to at december  from at december  the change in sensitivity since december  was the result of the current interest rate environment and our continuing effort to effectively manage interest rate risk 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing and funding activities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure 
one measure required to be performed by the ots regulated institutions is the test specified by ots thrift bulletin no 
a  management of interest rate risk  investment securities and derivatives activities 
this test measures the impact on the net portfolio value of an immediate change in interest rates in basis point increments 
net portfolio value is defined as the net present value of the estimated cash flows from assets and liabilities as a percentage of the net present value of assets 
the following table is the estimated impact of immediate changes in interest rates on our net interest margin and net portfolio value at the specified levels at december  and  calculated in compliance with thrift bulletin no 
a at december  change in change in change in interest rate net interest net portfolio net interest net portfolio basis points margin value margin value nmf nmf nm f nmf nmf nmf nm f nmf the percentage difference between net interest margin in a stable interest rate environment and net interest margin as projected under the various rate change environments 
the net portfolio value ratio in a stable interest rate environment and the net portfolio value as projected under the various rate change environments 
sensitivity indicated by a decrease of and basis points is deemed not meaningful nmf given the low absolute level of interest rates at that time 
our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income and capital  while maximizing the yield cost spread on our asset liability structure 
we rely primarily on our asset liability structure to control interest rate risk 
we also engage in other business activities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for example  mortgage banking revenues and expenses can fluctuate with changing interest rates 
these fluctuations are difficult to model and estimate 
during the first quarter of we executed million of intermediate term fhlb advances to reduce the sensitivity of our net interest income to increases in market interest rates
