item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary note regarding forward looking statements  as well as risks included elsewhere in our documents filed with the sec  before investing in any of our securities 
we may amend  supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the sec 
risks relating to our business if we are unable to implement our business strategies  our business and financial condition may be adversely affected 
our future results of operations will depend in significant part on the extent to which we can implement our business strategies successfully  including our ability to realize the anticipated growth opportunities  expanded market visibility and increased access to capital 
our business strategies include continuing to operate our portfolio of run off insurance and reinsurance companies and related management engagements  as well as pursuing additional acquisitions and management engagements in the run off segment of the insurance and reinsurance market 
we may not be able to implement our strategies fully or realize the anticipated results of our strategies as a result of significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues may result in increased provisions for loss reserves and reduced profitability in our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
such adverse business issues may also reduce the level of incentive based fees generated by our consulting operations 
adverse global economic conditions  such as rising interest rates and volatile foreign exchange rates  may cause widespread failure of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries reinsurers to satisfy their obligations  as well as failure of companies to meet their obligations under debt instruments held by our subsidiaries 
if the run off industry becomes more attractive to investors  competition for runoff acquisitions and management and consultancy engagements may increase and  therefore  reduce our ability to continue to make profitable acquisitions or expand our consultancy operations 
if we are unable to successfully implement our business strategies  we may not be able to achieve future growth in our earnings and our financial condition may suffer and  as a result  holders of our ordinary shares may receive lower returns 
we may require additional capital in the future that may not be available or may only be available on unfavorable terms 
our future capital requirements depend on many factors  including our ability to manage the run off of our assumed policies and to establish reserves at levels sufficient to cover losses 
we may need to raise additional funds through financings in the future 
any equity or debt financing  if available at all  may be on terms that are not favorable to us 
in the case of equity financings  dilution to our shareholders could result  and  in any case  such securities may have rights  preferences and privileges that are senior to those of our already outstanding securities 
if we cannot obtain adequate capital  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by  among other things  our inability to finance future acquisitions 
our inability to successfully manage our portfolio of insurance and reinsurance companies in run off may adversely impact our ability to grow our business and may result in losses 
we were founded to acquire and manage companies and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance in run off 
our run off business differs from the business of traditional insurance and reinsurance underwriting in that our insurance and reinsurance companies in run off no longer underwrite new policies and are subject to the risk that their stated provisions for losses and loss adjustment expense  or lae  will not be sufficient to cover future losses and the cost of run off 
because our companies in run off no longer collect underwriting premiums  our sources of capital to cover losses are limited to our stated reserves  reinsurance coverage and retained earnings 
as of december   our gross reserves for losses and loss adjustment expense totaled billion  and our reinsurance receivables totaled million 

table of contents in order for us to achieve positive operating results  we must first price acquisitions on favorable terms relative to the risks posed by the acquired businesses and then successfully manage the acquired businesses 
our inability to price acquisitions on favorable terms  efficiently manage claims  collect from reinsurers and control run off expenses could result in us having to cover losses sustained under assumed policies with retained earnings  which would materially and adversely impact our ability to grow our business and may result in material losses 
if our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries loss reserves are inadequate to cover their actual losses  our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries net income and capital and surplus would be reduced 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are required to maintain reserves to cover their estimated ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses for both reported and unreported incurred claims 
these reserves are only estimates of what our subsidiaries think the settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances known to the subsidiaries 
our commutation activity and claims settlement and development in recent years has resulted in net reductions in provisions for loss and loss adjustment expenses of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
although this recent experience indicates that our loss reserves have been more than adequate to meet our liabilities  because of the uncertainties that surround estimating loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses  our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries cannot be certain that ultimate losses will not exceed these estimates of losses and loss adjustment expenses 
if our subsidiaries reserves are insufficient to cover their actual losses and loss adjustment expenses  our subsidiaries would have to augment their reserves and incur a charge to their earnings 
these charges could be material and would reduce our net income and capital and surplus 
the difficulty in estimating the subsidiaries reserves is increased because our subsidiaries loss reserves include reserves for potential asbestos and environmental  or a e  liabilities 
at december   our insurance and reinsurance companies had recorded gross a e loss reserves of million  or of the total gross loss reserves 
net a e loss reserves at december  amounted to million  or of total net loss reserves 
a e liabilities are especially hard to estimate for many reasons  including the long waiting periods between exposure and manifestation of any bodily injury or property damage  the difficulty in identifying the source of the asbestos or environmental contamination  long reporting delays and the difficulty in properly allocating liability for the asbestos or environmental damage 
developed case law and adequate claim history do not always exist for such claims  especially because significant uncertainty exists about the outcome of coverage litigation and whether past claim experience will be representative of future claim experience 
in view of the changes in the legal and tort environment that affect the development of such claims  the uncertainties inherent in valuing a e claims are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
ultimate values for such claims cannot be estimated using traditional reserving techniques and there are significant uncertainties in estimating the amount of our subsidiaries potential losses for these claims 
our subsidiaries have not made any changes in reserve estimates that might arise as a result of any proposed us federal legislation related to asbestos 
to further understand this risk  see business reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense on page our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries reinsurers may not satisfy their obligations to our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are subject to credit risk with respect to their reinsurers because the transfer of risk to a reinsurer does not relieve our subsidiaries of their liability to the insured 
in addition  reinsurers may be unwilling to pay our subsidiaries even though they are able to do so 
as of december   the balances receivable from reinsurers amounted to million  of which million were associated with two reinsurers which each represented or more of total reinsurance balances receivable 
the two reinsurers had credit ratings  as provided by a major rating agency  of aa or higher 
in addition  many reinsurance companies have been negatively impacted by the deteriorating financial and economic conditions  including unprecedented financial market disruption 
a number of these companies  including some of those with which we conduct business  have been downgraded and or have been placed on negative outlook by various rating agencies 
the failure of one or more of our subsidiaries reinsurers to honor their obligations in a timely fashion may affect our cash flows  reduce our net income or cause us to incur a significant loss 
disputes with our reinsurers may also result in unforeseen expenses relating to litigation or arbitration proceedings 

table of contents the value of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries investment portfolios and the investment income that our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries receive from these portfolios may decline as a result of market fluctuations and economic conditions 
we derive a significant portion of our income from our invested assets 
the net investment income that our subsidiaries realize from investments in fixed maturity securities will generally increase or decrease with interest rates 
the fair market value of our subsidiaries fixed maturity securities generally increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates and can also decrease as a result of any downturn in the business cycle that causes the credit quality of those securities to deteriorate 
the fair market value of our subsidiaries fixed maturity securities classified as trading or available for sale in our subsidiaries investment portfolios amounted to billion at december  the changes in the market value of our subsidiaries securities that are classified as trading or available for sale are reflected in our financial statements 
permanent impairments in the value of our subsidiaries fixed maturity securities are also reflected in our financial statements 
as a result  a decline in the value of the securities in our subsidiaries investment portfolios may reduce our net income or cause us to incur a loss 
in addition to fixed maturity securities  we have invested  and may from time to time continue to invest  in private equities  equities and bond and hedge funds 
these and other similar investments may be illiquid and have different risk characteristics than our investments in fixed maturity securities 
as of december   we had an aggregate of million of such investments 
in  the fair value of our private equity investments increased by million due primarily to mark to market adjustments in the fair value of their underlying assets  which are primarily investments in financial institutions 
for more information  see business investment portfolio on page uncertain conditions in the economy generally may materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
the recent severe downturn in the public debt and equity markets  reflecting uncertainties associated with the mortgage crisis  worsening economic conditions  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies and government intervention in large financial institutions  resulted in significant unrealized losses in our investment portfolio 
while many governments  including the us federal government  have taken substantial steps to stabilize economic conditions in an effort to increase liquidity and capital availability  there continues to be significant uncertainty regarding the timeline for global economic recovery 
depending on market conditions going forward  we could incur substantial realized and additional unrealized losses in future periods  which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
disruptions  uncertainty and volatility in the global credit markets may also impact our ability to obtain financing for future acquisitions 
if financing is available  it may only be available at an unattractive cost of capital  which would decrease our profitability 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates may cause us to experience losses 
we maintain a portion of our investments  insurance liabilities and insurance assets denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
consequently  we and our subsidiaries may experience foreign exchange losses 
we publish our consolidated financial statements in us dollars 
therefore  fluctuations in exchange rates used to convert other currencies  particularly australian dollars  euros  british pounds and other european currencies  into us dollars will impact our reported consolidated financial condition  results of operations and cash flows from year to year 
we recorded  for the year ended december   foreign currency translation adjustment gains of million  net of noncontrolling interest of million  upon conversion of gordian s net australian dollar assets to us dollars due primarily to the increase in the australian to us dollar foreign exchange rate 
we have made  and expect to continue to make  strategic acquisitions of insurance and reinsurance companies in run off  and these activities may not be financially beneficial to us or our shareholders 
we have pursued and  as part of our strategy  we will continue to pursue growth through acquisitions and or strategic investments in insurance and reinsurance companies in run off 
we have made acquisitions and several investments and we expect to continue to make such acquisitions and investments 
we cannot be certain that any of these acquisitions or investments will be financially advantageous for us or our shareholders 

table of contents the negotiation of potential acquisitions or strategic investments  as well as the integration of an acquired business or portfolio  could result in a substantial diversion of management resources 
acquisitions could involve numerous additional risks such as potential losses from unanticipated litigation or levels of claims  an inability to generate sufficient revenue to offset acquisition costs and financial exposures in the event that the sellers of the entities we acquire are unable or unwilling to meet their indemnification  reinsurance and other obligations to us 
our ability to manage our growth through acquisitions or strategic investments will depend  in part  on our success in addressing these risks 
any failure by us to effectively implement our acquisition or strategic investment strategies could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our past and future acquisitions may expose us to operational risks such as cash flow shortages  challenges to recruit appropriate levels of personnel  financial exposures to foreign currencies  additional integration costs and management time and effort 
we have made acquisitions of insurance and reinsurance businesses in run off and entered into acquisitions of portfolios of insurance and reinsurance businesses in run off  and we may in the future make additional strategic acquisitions 
these acquisitions may expose us to operational challenges and risks  including funding cash flow shortages that may occur if anticipated revenues are not realized or are delayed  whether by general economic or market conditions or unforeseen internal difficulties  funding cash flow shortages that may occur if expenses are greater than anticipated  the value of assets being lower than expected or diminishing because of credit defaults or changes in interest rates  or liabilities assumed being greater than expected  integrating financial and operational reporting systems  including assurance of compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and our exchange act reporting requirements  establishing satisfactory budgetary and other financial controls  funding increased capital needs and overhead expenses  obtaining management personnel required for expanded operations  and the assets and liabilities we may acquire may be subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation 
our failure to manage successfully these operational challenges and risks could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
fluctuations in the reinsurance industry may cause our operating results to fluctuate 
the reinsurance industry historically has been subject to significant fluctuations and uncertainties 
factors that affect the industry in general may also cause our operating results to fluctuate 
the industry s profitability may be affected significantly by fluctuations in interest rates  inflationary pressures and other changes in the investment environment  which affect returns on invested capital and may affect the ultimate payout of loss amounts and the costs of administering books of reinsurance business  volatile and unpredictable developments  such as those that have occurred recently in the world wide financial and credit markets  which may adversely affect the recoverability of reinsurance from our reinsurers  changes in reserves resulting from different types of claims that may arise and the development of judicial interpretations relating to the scope of insurers liability  and the overall level of economic activity and the competitive environment in the industry 

table of contents the effects of emerging claim and coverage issues on our business are uncertain 
as industry practices and legal  judicial  social and other environmental conditions change  unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge 
these issues may adversely affect the adequacy of our provision for losses and loss adjustment expenses by either extending coverage beyond the intent of insurance policies and reinsurance contracts envisioned at the time they were written  or by increasing the number or size of claims 
in some instances  these changes may not become apparent until some time after we have acquired companies or portfolios of insurance or reinsurance contracts that are affected by the changes 
as a result  the full extent of liability under these insurance or reinsurance contracts may not be known for many years after a contract has been issued 
to further understand this risk  see business reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense on page insurance laws and regulations restrict our ability to operate  and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations  or any investigations by government authorities  may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we are subject to extensive regulation under insurance laws of a number of jurisdictions  and compliance with legal and regulatory requirements is expensive 
these laws limit the amount of dividends that can be paid to us by our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  prescribe solvency standards that they must meet and maintain  impose restrictions on the amount and type of investments that they can hold to meet solvency requirements and require them to maintain reserves 
failure to comply with these laws may subject our subsidiaries to fines and penalties and restrict them from conducting business 
the application of these laws may affect our liquidity and ability to pay dividends on our ordinary shares and may restrict our ability to expand our business operations through acquisitions 
at december   the required statutory capital and surplus of our insurance and reinsurance companies amounted to million compared to the actual statutory capital and surplus of billion 
as of december   million of our total investments of billion were not admissible for statutory solvency purposes 
to further understand this risk  see business regulation beginning on page the insurance industry has experienced substantial volatility as a result of current investigations  litigation and regulatory activity by various insurance  governmental and enforcement authorities  including the sec concerning certain practices within the insurance industry 
these practices include the sale and purchase of finite reinsurance or other non traditional or loss mitigation insurance products and the accounting treatment for those products 
insurance and reinsurance companies that we have acquired  or may acquire in the future  may have been or may become involved in these investigations and have lawsuits filed against them 
our involvement in any investigations and related lawsuits would cause us to incur legal costs and  if we were found to have violated any laws  we could be required to pay fines and damages  perhaps in material amounts 
if we fail to comply with applicable insurance laws and regulations  we may be subject to disciplinary action  damages  penalties or restrictions that may have a material adverse effect on our business 
our subsidiaries may not have maintained or be able to maintain all required licenses and approvals or that their businesses fully comply with the laws and regulations to which they are subject  or the relevant insurance regulatory authority s interpretation of those laws and regulations 
in addition  some regulatory authorities have relatively broad discretion to grant  renew or revoke licenses and approvals 
if our subsidiaries do not have the requisite licenses and approvals or do not comply with applicable regulatory requirements  the insurance regulatory authorities may preclude or suspend our subsidiaries from carrying on some or all of their activities  place one of more of them into rehabilitation or liquidation proceedings  or impose monetary penalties on them 
these types of actions may have a material adverse effect on our business and may preclude us from making future acquisitions or obtaining future engagements to manage companies and portfolios in run off 

table of contents exit and finality opportunities provided by solvent schemes of arrangement may not continue to be available  which may result in the diversion of our resources to settle policyholder claims for a substantially longer run off period and increase the associated costs of run off of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries 
with respect to our uk  bermudian and australian insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  we are able to pursue strategies to achieve complete finality and conclude the run off of a company by promoting solvent schemes of arrangement 
solvent schemes of arrangement have been a popular means of achieving financial certainty and finality for insurance and reinsurance companies incorporated or managed in the uk  bermuda and australia  by making a one time full and final settlement of an insurance and reinsurance company s liabilities to policyholders 
a solvent scheme of arrangement is an arrangement between a company and its creditors or any class of them 
for a solvent scheme of arrangement to become binding on the creditors  a meeting of each class of creditors must be called  with the permission of the local court  to consider and  if thought fit  approve the solvent scheme of arrangement 
the requisite statutory majority of creditors of not less than in value and in number of those creditors actually attending the meeting  either in person or by proxy  must vote in favor of a solvent scheme of arrangement 
once the solvent scheme of arrangement has been approved by the statutory majority of voting creditors of the company  it requires the sanction of the local court at a hearing at which creditors may appear 
the court must be satisfied that the scheme is fair 
in july  the case of british aviation insurance company  or baic  was the first solvent scheme of arrangement to fail to be sanctioned by the english high court  following opposition by certain creditors 
the primary reason for the failure of the baic arrangement was the failure to adequately provide for different classes of creditors to vote separately on the arrangement 
however  since baic  approximately solvent schemes of arrangement have been sanctioned  including one relating to one of our subsidiaries  such that the prevailing view is that the baic judgment was very fact specific to the case in question  and solvent schemes generally should continue to be promoted and sanctioned as a viable means for achieving finality for our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries following the baic judgment  insurance and reinsurance companies must take more care in drafting a solvent scheme of arrangement to fit the circumstances of the company including the determination of the appropriate classes of creditors 
this remains so after the january decision of the inner house of the scottish court of session in the scottish lion case to the effect that solvent schemes are to be considered on their individual merits following a full consideration of the relevant evidence  and that the existence of opposition to a scheme is not  without a full hearing of the evidence  fatal to an application for sanction 
should a solvent scheme of arrangement promoted by any of our insurance or reinsurance subsidiaries fail to receive the requisite approval by creditors or sanction by the court  we will have to run off these liabilities until expiry  which may result in the diversion of our resources to settle policyholder claims for a substantially longer run off period and increase the associated costs of run off  resulting potentially in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on our executive officers  directors and other key personnel and the loss of any of these individuals could adversely affect our business 
our success substantially depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and upon the ability of our senior management and other key employees to implement our business strategy 
we believe that there are only a limited number of available qualified personnel in the business in which we compete 
we rely substantially upon the services of dominic f 
silvester  our chairman and chief executive officer  paul j 
o shea and nicholas a 
packer  our executive vice presidents and joint chief operating officers  richard j 
harris  our chief financial officer  and our subsidiaries executive officers and directors to identify and consummate the acquisition of insurance and reinsurance companies and portfolios in run off on favorable terms and to implement our run off strategy 
each of messrs 
silvester  o shea  packer and harris has an employment agreement with us 
the loss of the services of any of our management or other key personnel  or the loss of the services of or our relationships with any of our directors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
under bermuda law  non bermudians other than spouses of bermudians  holders of permanent resident s certificates or holders of a working resident s certificate may not engage in any gainful occupation in bermuda without an appropriate governmental work permit 
work permits may be granted or extended by the bermuda government upon showing that  after proper public advertisement in most cases  no bermudian or spouse of a 
table of contents bermudian  holder of a permanent resident s certificate or holders of a working resident s certificate is available who meets the minimum standard requirements for the advertised position 
the bermuda government s policy limits the duration of work permits to six years  with certain exemptions for key employees and job categories where there is a worldwide shortage of qualified employees 
as a result  if we were to lose any of our key employees the work permit laws and policies may hinder our ability to replace them 
conflicts of interest might prevent us from pursuing desirable investment and business opportunities 
our directors and executive officers may have ownership interests or other involvement with entities that could compete against us  either in the pursuit of acquisition targets or in general business operations 
on occasion  we have also participated in transactions in which one or more of our directors or executive officers had an interest 
in particular  we have invested  and expect to continue to invest  in or with entities that are affiliates of or otherwise related to mr 
flowers 
the interests of our directors and executive officers in such transactions or such entities may result in a conflict of interest for those directors and officers 
the independent members of our board of directors review any material transactions involving a conflict of interest and may take appropriate actions as may be deemed appropriate by them in the particular circumstances 
we may not be able to pursue all advantageous transactions that we would otherwise pursue in the absence of a conflict should our board of directors be unable to determine that any such transaction is on terms as favorable as we could otherwise obtain in the absence of a conflict 
our inability to successfully manage the companies and portfolios for which we have been engaged as a third party manager may adversely impact our financial results and our ability to win future management engagements 
in addition to acquiring insurance and reinsurance companies in run off  we have entered into several management agreements with third parties to manage their companies or portfolios of business in run off 
the terms of these management engagements typically include incentive payments to us based on our ability to successfully manage the run off of these companies or portfolios 
we may not be able to accomplish our objectives for these engagements as a result of unforeseen circumstances such as the length of time for claims to develop  the extent to which losses may exceed reserves  changes in the law that may require coverage of additional claims and losses  our ability to commute reinsurance policies on favorable terms and our ability to manage run off expenses 
if we are not successful in meeting our objectives for these management engagements  we may not receive incentive payments under our management agreements  which could adversely impact our financial results  and we may not win future engagements to provide these management services  which could slow the growth of our business 
consulting fees generated from management agreements amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we are a holding company  and we are dependent on the ability of our subsidiaries to distribute funds to us 
we are a holding company and conduct substantially all of our operations through subsidiaries 
our only significant assets are the capital stock of our subsidiaries 
as a holding company  we are dependent on distributions of funds from our subsidiaries to pay dividends  fund acquisitions or fulfill financial obligations in the normal course of our business 
our subsidiaries may not generate sufficient cash from operations to enable us to make dividend payments  acquire additional companies or insurance or reinsurance portfolios or fulfill other financial obligations 
the ability of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to make distributions to us is limited by applicable insurance laws and regulations  and the ability of all of our subsidiaries to make distributions to us may be restricted by  among other things  other applicable laws and regulations and the terms of our subsidiaries bank loans 

table of contents risks relating to ownership of our ordinary shares our stock price may experience volatility  thereby causing a potential loss of value to our investors 
the market price for our ordinary shares may fluctuate substantially due to  among other things  the following factors announcements with respect to an acquisition or investment  changes in the value of our assets  our quarterly and annual operating results  sales  or the possibility or perception of future sales  by our existing shareholders  changes in general conditions in the economy and the insurance industry  the financial markets  and adverse press or news announcements 
a few significant shareholders may influence or control the direction of our business 
if the ownership of our ordinary shares continues to be highly concentrated  it may limit your ability and the ability of other shareholders to influence significant corporate decisions 
the interests of messrs 
flowers  silvester  packer and o shea  advisory research  inc  or advisory  and beck mack oliver llc  or beck mack  may not be fully aligned with your interests  and this may lead to a strategy that is not in your best interest 
as of december   messrs 
flowers  silvester  packer and o shea  advisory and beck mack beneficially owned approximately     and  respectively  of our outstanding ordinary shares 
although they do not act as a group  advisory  beck mack and each of messrs 
flowers  silvester  packer and o shea exercise significant influence over matters requiring shareholder approval  and their concentrated holdings may delay or deter possible changes in control of enstar  which may reduce the market price of our ordinary shares 
for further information on aspects of our bye laws that may discourage changes of control of enstar  see some aspects of our corporate structure may discourage third party takeovers and other transactions or prevent the removal of our board of directors and management below 
some aspects of our corporate structure may discourage third party takeovers and other transactions or prevent the removal of our board of directors and management 
some provisions of our bye laws have the effect of making more difficult or discouraging unsolicited takeover bids from third parties or preventing the removal of our current board of directors and management 
in particular  our bye laws make it difficult for any us shareholder or direct foreign shareholder group a shareholder or group of commonly controlled shareholders of enstar that are not us persons to own or control ordinary shares that constitute or more of the voting power of all of our ordinary shares 
the votes conferred by such shares will be reduced by whatever amount is necessary so that after any such reduction the votes conferred by such shares will constitute of the total voting power of all ordinary shares entitled to vote generally 
the primary purpose of this restriction is to reduce the likelihood that we will be deemed a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of internal revenue code of  as amended  or the code  for us federal tax purposes 
however  this limit may also have the effect of deterring purchases of large blocks of our ordinary shares or proposals to acquire us  even if some or a majority of our shareholders might deem these purchases or acquisition proposals to be in their best interests 
in addition  our bye laws provide for a classified board  whose members may be removed by our shareholders only for cause by a majority vote  and contain restrictions on the ability of shareholders to nominate persons to serve as directors  submit resolutions to a shareholder vote and request special general meetings 
these bye law provisions make it more difficult to acquire control of us by means of a tender offer  open market purchase  proxy contest or otherwise 
these provisions may encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to negotiate with our directors  which we believe would generally best serve the interests of our shareholders 
however  these provisions may have the effect of discouraging a prospective acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us 
in addition  these bye law provisions may prevent the removal of our 
table of contents current board of directors and management 
to the extent these provisions discourage takeover attempts  they may deprive shareholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares or may depress the market price of the shares 
the market value of our ordinary shares may decline if large numbers of shares are sold  including pursuant to existing registration rights 
we have entered into a registration rights agreement with mr 
flowers and mr 
silvester and certain other of our shareholders 
this agreement provides that mr 
flowers and mr 
silvester may request that we effect a registration under the securities act of certain of their ordinary shares 
in addition  they and the other shareholders party to the agreement have piggyback registration rights  which may result in their participation in an offering initiated by us 
as of december   an aggregate of approximately million ordinary shares held by mr 
flowers and mr 
silvester are subject to the agreement 
by exercising their registration rights  these holders could cause a large number of ordinary shares to be registered and generally become freely tradable without restrictions under the securities act immediately upon the effectiveness of the registration 
our ordinary shares have in the past been  and may from time to time continue to be  thinly traded  and significant sales  pursuant to the existing registration rights or otherwise  could adversely affect the market price for our ordinary shares and impair our ability to raise capital through offerings of our equity securities 
because we are incorporated in bermuda  it may be difficult for shareholders to serve process or enforce judgments against us or our directors and officers 
we are a bermuda company 
in addition  certain of our officers and directors reside in countries outside the united states 
all or a substantial portion of our assets and the assets of these officers and directors are or may be located outside the united states 
investors may have difficulty effecting service of process within the united states on our directors and officers who reside outside the united states or recovering against us or these directors and officers on judgments of us courts based on civil liabilities provisions of the us federal securities laws even though we have appointed an agent in the united states to receive service of process 
further  no claim may be brought in bermuda against us or our directors and officers for violation of us federal securities laws  as such laws do not have force of law in bermuda 
a bermuda court may  however  impose civil liability  including the possibility of monetary damages  on us or our directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under bermuda law 
we believe that there is doubt as to whether the courts of bermuda would enforce judgments of us courts obtained in actions against us or our directors and officers  as well as our independent auditors  predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the us federal securities laws or original actions brought in bermuda against us or these persons predicated solely upon us federal securities laws 
further  there is no treaty in effect between the united states and bermuda providing for the enforcement of judgments of us courts  and there are grounds upon which bermuda courts may not enforce judgments of us courts 
some remedies available under the laws of us jurisdictions  including some remedies available under the us federal securities laws  may not be allowed in bermuda courts as contrary to that jurisdiction s public policy 
because judgments of us courts are not automatically enforceable in bermuda  it may be difficult for you to recover against us based upon such judgments 
shareholders who own our ordinary shares may have more difficulty in protecting their interests than shareholders of a us corporation 
the bermuda companies act  or the companies act  which applies to us  differs in certain material respects from laws generally applicable to us corporations and their shareholders 
as a result of these differences  shareholders who own our shares may have more difficulty protecting their interests than shareholders who own shares of a us corporation 
for example  class actions and derivative actions are generally not available to shareholders under bermuda law 
under bermuda law  only shareholders holding or more of our outstanding ordinary shares or numbering or more are entitled to propose a resolution at our general meeting 

table of contents we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our ordinary shares 
we do not intend to pay a cash dividend on our ordinary shares 
rather  we intend to use any retained earnings to fund the development and growth of our business 
from time to time  our board of directors will review our alternatives with respect to our earnings and seek to maximize value for our shareholders 
in the future  we may decide to commence a dividend program for the benefit of our shareholders 
any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be limited by our position as a holding company that lacks direct operations  the results of operations of our subsidiaries  our financial condition  cash requirements and prospects and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 
in addition  there are significant regulatory and other constraints that could prevent us from paying dividends in any event 
as a result  capital appreciation  if any  on our ordinary shares may be your sole source of gain for the foreseeable future 
our board of directors may decline to register a transfer of our ordinary shares under certain circumstances 
our board of directors may decline to register a transfer of ordinary shares under certain circumstances  including if it has reason to believe that any non de minimis adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequences to us  any of our subsidiaries or any of our shareholders may occur as a result of such transfer 
further  our bye laws provide us with the option to repurchase  or to assign to a third party the right to purchase  the minimum number of shares necessary to eliminate any such non de minimis adverse tax  regulatory or legal consequence 
in addition  our board of directors may decline to approve or register a transfer of shares unless all applicable consents  authorizations  permissions or approvals of any governmental body or agency in bermuda  the united states or any other applicable jurisdiction required to be obtained prior to such transfer shall have been obtained 
the proposed transferor of any shares will be deemed to own those shares for dividend  voting and reporting purposes until a transfer of such shares has been registered on our shareholders register 
it is our understanding that while the precise form of the restrictions on transfer contained in our bye laws is untested  as a matter of general principle  restrictions on transfers are enforceable under bermuda law and are not uncommon 
these restrictions on transfer may also have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
risks relating to taxation we might incur unexpected us  us or australia tax liabilities if companies in our group that are incorporated outside those jurisdictions are determined to be carrying on a trade or business there 
we and a number of our subsidiaries are companies formed under the laws of bermuda or other jurisdictions that do not impose income taxes  it is our contemplation that these companies will not incur substantial income tax liabilities from their operations 
because the operations of these companies generally involve  or relate to  the insurance or reinsurance of risks that arise in higher tax jurisdictions  such as the united states  united kingdom and australia  it is possible that the taxing authorities in those jurisdictions may assert that the activities of one or more of these companies creates a sufficient nexus in that jurisdiction to subject the company to income tax there 
there are uncertainties in how the relevant rules apply to insurance businesses  and in our eligibility for favorable treatment under applicable tax treaties 
accordingly  it is possible that we could incur substantial unexpected tax liabilities 
us persons who own our ordinary shares might become subject to adverse us tax consequences as a result of related person insurance income  or rpii  if any  of our non us insurance company subsidiaries 
if the rpii rules of the code were to apply to us  a us person who owns our ordinary shares directly or indirectly through foreign entities on the last day of the taxable year would be required to include in income for us federal income tax purposes the shareholder s pro rata share of our non us subsidiaries rpii for the entire taxable year  determined as if that rpii were distributed proportionately to the us shareholders at that date regardless whether any actual distribution is made 
in addition  any rpii that is includible in the income of a us tax exempt organization would generally be treated as unrelated business taxable income 
although we and 
table of contents our subsidiaries intend to generally operate in a manner so as to qualify for certain exceptions to the rpii rules  there can be no assurance that these exceptions will be available 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that us persons who own our ordinary shares will not be required to recognize gross income inclusions attributable to rpii 
in addition  the rpii rules provide that if a shareholder who is a us person disposes of shares in a foreign insurance company that has rpii and in which us persons collectively own or more of the shares  any gain from the disposition will generally be treated as dividend income to the extent of the shareholder s share of the corporation s undistributed earnings and profits that were accumulated during the period that the shareholder owned the shares whether or not those earnings and profits are attributable to rpii 
such a shareholder would also be required to comply with certain reporting requirements  regardless of the amount of shares owned by the shareholder 
these rules should not apply to dispositions of our ordinary shares because we will not be directly engaged in the insurance business 
the rpii rules  however  have not been interpreted by the courts or the us internal revenue service  or the irs  and regulations interpreting the rpii rules exist only in proposed form 
accordingly  there is no assurance that our views as to the inapplicability of these rules to a disposition of our ordinary shares will be accepted by the irs or a court 
us persons who own our ordinary shares would be subject to adverse tax consequences if we or one or more of our non us subsidiaries were considered a passive foreign investment company  or pfic  for us federal income tax purposes 
we believe that we and our non us subsidiaries will not be pfics for us federal income purposes for the current year 
moreover  we do not expect to conduct our activities in a manner that will cause us or any of our non us subsidiaries to become a pfic in the future 
however  there can be no assurance that the irs will not challenge this position or that a court will not sustain such challenge 
accordingly  it is possible that we or one or more of our non us subsidiaries might be deemed a pfic by the irs or a court for the current year or any future year 
if we or one or more of our non us subsidiaries were a pfic  it could have material adverse tax consequences for an investor that is subject to us federal income taxation  including subjecting the investor to a substantial acceleration and or increase in tax liability 
there are currently no regulations regarding the application of the pfic provisions of the code to an insurance company  so the application of those provisions to insurance companies remains unclear in certain respects 
we may become subject to taxes in bermuda after march  the bermuda minister of finance  under the exempted undertakings tax protection act  as amended  of bermuda  has given us and each of our bermuda subsidiaries an assurance that if any legislation is enacted in bermuda that would impose tax computed on profits or income  or computed on any capital asset  gain or appreciation  or any tax in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax  then the imposition of any such tax will not be applicable to us or our bermuda subsidiaries or any of our or their respective operations  shares  debentures or other obligations until march  given the limited duration of the minister of finance s assurance  we cannot be certain that we will not be subject to any bermuda tax after march  in the event that we become subject to any bermuda tax after such date  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the bermuda minister of finance announced  in november  that the assurance will be extended to  however  the required legislation for this has not yet been brought before the bermuda legislature 
us persons who own percent or more of our shares may be subject to taxation under the controlled foreign corporation  or cfc  rules 
a us person that is a us shareholder of a non us corporation non us  a non us person who owns or is treated as owning at least of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock entitled to vote of the non us corporation that is a cfc for an uninterrupted period of days or more during a taxable year  that owns shares in the cfc directly or indirectly through non us entities on the last day of the cfc s taxable year  must include in its gross income for us federal income tax purposes its pro rata share of the cfc s subpart f income  even if the subpart f income is not distributed 
subpart f income of a non us insurance corporation typically includes foreign personal holding company income such as interest  dividends and other types of passive income  as well as insurance and reinsurance income including underwriting and investment income 

table of contents a non us corporation is considered a cfc if non us shareholders own directly  indirectly through non us entities or by attribution by application of the constructive ownership rules of section b of the code ie  constructively more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of that foreign corporation  or the total value of all stock of that foreign corporation 
for purposes of taking into account insurance income  a cfc also includes a non us insurance company in which more than of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock or more than of the total value of the stock is owned directly  indirectly through non us entities or constructively by non us shareholders on any day during the taxable year of such corporation  if the gross amount of premiums or other consideration for the reinsurance or the issuing of insurance other than certain insurance or reinsurance related to same country risks written by certain insurance companies not applicable here exceeds of the gross amount of all premiums or other consideration in respect of all risks 
we believe that because of the dispersion of our share ownership  and provisions in our organizational documents that limit voting power  no us person including our subsidiary enstar usa  inc  which owns certain of our non voting shares should be treated as owning directly  indirectly through non us entities or constructively or more of the total voting power of all classes of our shares 
however  the irs could successfully challenge the effectiveness of these provisions in our organizational documents 
accordingly  no assurance can be given that a us person who owns our shares will not be characterized as a us shareholder 
changes in us federal income tax law could materially affect us or our shareholders 
legislation has been proposed on various occasions to eliminate perceived tax advantages of insurance companies that have legal domiciles outside the united states but have certain us connections 
for example  proposed legislation was introduced in congress in to limit the deductibility of reinsurance premiums paid by us companies to non us affiliates  although no such provision was enacted 
it is possible that similar legislation could be introduced in and enacted by the current congress or future congresses and enactment of some version of such legislation  or other changes in us tax laws  regulations or interpretations thereof  could have an adverse impact on us or our shareholders

business overview we were formed in august under the laws of bermuda to acquire and manage insurance and reinsurance companies in run off and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business in run off  and to provide management  consulting and other services to the insurance and reinsurance industry 
on january   we completed the merger  or the merger  of cwms subsidiary corp  a georgia corporation and our wholly owned subsidiary  with and into the enstar group  inc  a georgia corporation 
as a result of the merger  the enstar group  inc  renamed enstar usa  inc  is now our wholly owned subsidiary 
the enstar group  inc owned an approximate economic and a voting interest in us prior to the merger 
since our formation  we  through our subsidiaries  have completed acquisitions of insurance and reinsurance companies and acquisitions of portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business and are now administering those businesses in run off 
we operate our business internationally through our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries and our consulting subsidiaries in bermuda  the united kingdom  the united states  europe and australia 
we had a total of employees as at december  summary we completed the acquisitions of six companies and eight portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business  we repaid or paid down a number of our existing loan facilities and entered into two new bank loan facilities that remained outstanding as at december   and on october   we repurchased  shares at a price of per share from three of our executives and certain trusts and a corporation affiliated with the executives 
we issued promissory notes for the aggregate purchase price of million  of which million was outstanding at december   and is payable over approximately two years 
results of operations net earnings attributable to enstar group limited amounted to million  or per basic share and per diluted share  net investment income and net realized gains amounted to million  and net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities amounted to million 

table of contents financial condition total cash and investments of billion  total assets of billion  reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses of billion and reinsurance recoverables of million  and total shareholders equity attributable to enstar group limited of million  net book value per basic share of and per diluted share of 
outlook for in february  we entered into ritc agreements with two lloyd s syndicates with total gross insurance reserves of approximately million  during  we signed definitive agreements for the acquisitions of both clarendon and citilife financial limited for a total purchase price of approximately million 
these acquisitions are expected to close in the second and first quarter of  respectively  on march   we  through our wholly owned subsidiary  clarendon holdings  inc  entered into a million term facility agreement  or the clarendon facility  with a london based bank  which will be available to be drawn to fund up to of the purchase price of clarendon  we expect our employee head count to increase by approximately due primarily to the acquisition of clarendon along with continued growth of our operations  we will continue to work with our regulators to facilitate the release of surplus capital from our regulated subsidiaries  and we will continue to source and complete  where appropriate  the acquisition of companies and portfolios of insurance and reinsurance business in run off 
financial statement overview consulting fee income we generate consulting fees based on a combination of fixed and success based fee arrangements 
consulting income will vary from period to period depending on the timing of completion of success based fee arrangements 
success based fees are recorded when targets related to overall project completion or profitability goals are achieved 
our consulting segment  in addition to providing services to third parties  also provides management services to the reinsurance segment based on agreed terms set out in management agreements between the parties 
the fees charged by the consulting segment to the reinsurance segment are eliminated against the cost incurred by the reinsurance segment on consolidation 
net investment income and net realized and unrealized gains losses our net investment income is principally derived from interest earned primarily on cash and investments offset by investment management fees paid 
our investment portfolio currently consists of the following fixed maturity investments that are classified as both available for sale and trading and are carried at fair value  short term investments that are classified as both available for sale and trading and are carried at fair value  equities that are carried at fair value  and other investments that are accounted for at estimated fair values determined by our proportionate share of the net asset value of the investee reduced by any impairment charges 
our current investment strategy seeks to preserve principal and maintain liquidity while trying to maximize investment return through a high quality  diversified portfolio 
the volatility of claims and the effect they have on the amount of cash and investment balances  as well as the level of interest rates and other market factors  affect the return we are able to generate on our investment portfolio 
when we make a new acquisition we will often restructure the acquired investment portfolio  which may generate one time realized gains or losses 

table of contents net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities our insurance related earnings are comprised primarily of reductions  or potential increases  of net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities 
these liabilities are comprised of outstanding loss or case reserves  or olr  which represent management s best estimate of the likely settlement amount for known claims  less the portion that can be recovered from reinsurers  reserves for losses incurred but not reported  or ibnr reserves  which are reserves established by us for claims that are not yet reported but can reasonably be expected to have occurred based on industry information  management s experience and actuarial evaluation  less the portion that can be recovered from reinsurers  and reserves for unallocated loss adjustment expenses  which represent management s best estimate of the future costs to be incurred by us in managing the run off of claims liabilities not specific  or allocated  to individual claims or policies 
net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities are reviewed by our management each quarter and by independent actuaries annually as of year end 
reserves reflect management s best estimate of the remaining unpaid portion of these liabilities 
prior period estimates of net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities may change as our management considers the combined impact of commutations  policy buy backs  settlement of losses on carried reserves and the trend of incurred loss development compared to prior forecasts 
commutations provide an opportunity for us to exit exposures to entire policies with insureds and reinsureds at a discount to the previously estimated ultimate liability 
to the extent possible  our internal and external actuaries eliminate all prior historical loss development that relates to commuted exposures and apply their actuarial methodologies to the remaining aggregate exposures and revised historical loss development information to reassess estimates of ultimate liabilities 
policy buy backs provide an opportunity for us to settle individual policies and losses usually at a discount to carried advised loss reserves 
as part of our routine claims settlement operations  claims will settle at either below or above the carried advised loss reserve 
the impact of policy buy backs and the routine settlement of claims updates historical loss development information to which actuarial methodologies are applied  often resulting in revised estimates of ultimate liabilities 
our actuarial methodologies include industry benchmarking  which  under certain methodologies discussed further under critical accounting policies below  compares the trend of our loss development to that of the industry 
to the extent that the trend of our loss development compared to the industry changes in any period  it is likely to have an impact on the estimate of ultimate liabilities 
additionally  consolidated net reductions  or potential increases  in net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities include reductions  or potential increases  in the provisions for future losses and loss adjustment expenses related to the current period s run off activity 
net reductions in net ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities are reported as negative expenses by us in our reinsurance segment 
the unallocated loss adjustment expenses paid by the reinsurance segment comprise management fees paid to the consulting segment and are eliminated on consolidation 
the consulting segment costs in providing run off services are classified as salaries and general and administrative expenses 
for more information on how the reserves are calculated  see critical accounting policies loss and loss adjustment expenses on page as our reinsurance subsidiaries are in run off  our premium income is insignificant  consisting primarily of adjustment premiums triggered by loss payments 
salaries and benefits we are a service based company and  as such  employee salaries and benefits are our largest expense 
we have experienced significant increases in our salaries and benefits expenses as we have grown our operations  and we expect that trend to continue if we are able to expand our operations successfully 
the enstar group limited equity incentive plan  or the equity incentive plan  and the enstar group limited annual incentive compensation plan  or the annual incentive plan  which are administered by the compensation committee of our board of directors  provide for the annual grant of bonus compensation to our 
table of contents officers and employees  including our senior executive officers 
in february  we adopted the enstar group limited annual incentive compensation program 
bonus awards for each calendar year from through were determined  and for calendar year will be determined  based on our consolidated net after tax profits 
the compensation committee determines the amount of bonus awards in any calendar year  based on a percentage of our consolidated net after tax profits 
the percentage is unless the compensation committee exercises its discretion to change the percentage no later than days after our year end 
for the years ended december   and the percentage was left unchanged by the compensation committee 
the compensation committee determines  in its sole discretion  the amount of bonus awards payable to each participant 
bonus awards are payable in cash  ordinary shares or a combination of both 
ordinary shares issued in connection with a bonus award will be issued pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions of the equity incentive plan 
for information on the awards made under both the annual and equity incentive plans for the years ended december   and  see note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   included in item of this annual report 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include rent and rent related costs  professional fees legal  investment  audit and actuarial and travel expenses 
we have operations in multiple jurisdictions and our employees travel frequently in connection with the search for acquisition opportunities and in the general management of the business 
while certain general and administrative expenses  such as professional fees  are incurred directly by the reinsurance segment  the remaining general and administrative expenses are incurred by the consulting segment 
to the extent that such costs incurred by the consulting segment relate to the management of the reinsurance segment  they are recovered by the consulting segment through the management fees charged to the reinsurance segment 
foreign exchange gain loss our reporting currency is us dollars 
our functional currency is us dollars for all of our subsidiaries with the exception of gordian  whose functional currency is australian dollars 
through our subsidiaries whose functional currency is the us dollar  we hold a variety of foreign non us currency assets and liabilities  the principal exposures being euros  british pounds and australian dollars 
at each balance sheet date  recorded balances that are denominated in a currency other than us dollars are adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate 
revenue and expense items are translated into us dollars at average rates of exchange for the applicable period 
the resulting exchange gains or losses are included in our net income 
for gordian  whose functional currency is australian dollars  at each reporting period the balance sheet and income statement are translated at period end and average rates of exchange  respectively  with any foreign exchange gains or losses on translation recorded as a component of our accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our balance sheet 
we seek to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange  where possible  by broadly matching our foreign currency assets against our foreign currency liabilities and to selectively use foreign currency exchange contracts 
subject to regulatory constraints  the net assets of our subsidiaries are maintained in us dollars 
income tax recovery under current bermuda law  we and our bermuda subsidiaries are not required to pay taxes in bermuda on either income or capital gains 
these companies have received an undertaking from the bermuda government that  in the event of income or capital gains taxes being imposed  they will be exempted from such taxes until the year income taxes have been provided  in accordance with the provisions of the income taxes topic of fasb asc  on our operations in other jurisdictions which are subject to income tax 
the calculation of our tax liabilities 
table of contents involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations 
deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
such temporary differences are due primarily to the tax basis discount on unpaid losses and loss expenses  net operating loss carryforwards  and certain investments 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is recorded if it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the benefits related to deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at each balance sheet date  we assess the need to establish a valuation allowance that reduces the net deferred tax asset when it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the valuation allowance is based on all available information including projections of future us gaap taxable income from each tax paying component in each tax jurisdiction 
projections of future us gaap taxable income incorporate several assumptions of future business and operations that are likely to differ from actual experience 
we also  in accordance with the income taxes topic of fasb asc  record tax liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions 
noncontrolling interest the acquisitions of hillcot re formerly toa re insurance company uk limited in march and of brampton formerly aioi insurance company of europe limited in march were effected through hillcot  a bermuda based company in which we had a economic interest until october  the results of operations of hillcot were included in our consolidated statements of operations with the remaining economic interest in the results of hillcot reflected as a noncontrolling interest until october  when we acquired the interest in hillcot re that we previously did not own 
as a result  the noncontrolling interest in the earnings of hillcot re was recorded only through september  on november   we acquired the of the shares of hillcot that we did not previously own

the results of operations of bosworth are included in our consolidated statements of earnings with the remaining noncontrolling interests share of the economic interest of bosworth reflected as a noncontrolling interest 
negative goodwill negative goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of businesses acquired by us over the cost of such businesses 
in accordance with the business combinations topic of fasb asc  or asc  this amount is recognized upon the acquisition of the businesses as an extraordinary gain 
the fair values of the reinsurance assets 
table of contents and liabilities acquired are derived from probability weighted ranges of the associated projected cash flows  based on actuarially prepared information and our management s run off strategy 
any amendment to the fair values resulting from changes in such information or strategy will be recognized when they occur 
for more information on how the goodwill is determined  see critical accounting policies goodwill on page critical accounting policies certain amounts in our consolidated financial statements require the use of best estimates and assumptions to determine reported values 
these amounts could ultimately be materially different than what has been provided for in our consolidated financial statements 
we consider the assessment of loss reserves and reinsurance recoverable to be the values requiring the most inherently subjective and complex estimates 
in addition  the fair value measurement of our investments and the assessment of the possible impairment of goodwill involves certain estimates and assumptions 
as such  the accounting policies for these amounts are of critical importance to our consolidated financial statements

table of contents annual loss and loss adjustment reviews because a significant amount of time can lapse between the assumption of risk  the occurrence of a loss event  the reporting of the event to an insurance or reinsurance company and the ultimate payment of the claim on the loss event  the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is based largely upon estimates 
our management must use considerable judgment in the process of developing these estimates 
the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses for property and casualty business includes amounts determined from loss reports on individual cases and amounts for ibnr reserves 
such reserves  including ibnr reserves  are estimated by management based upon loss reports received from ceding companies  supplemented by our own estimates of losses for which no ceding company loss reports have yet been received 
in establishing reserves  management also considers independent actuarial estimates of ultimate losses 
our independent actuaries employ generally accepted actuarial methodologies to estimate ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses 
a loss reserve study prepared by an independent actuary provides the basis of our reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
nearly all of our unpaid claims liabilities are considered to have a longtail claims payout 
gross loss reserves relate primarily to casualty exposures  including latent claims  of which approximately relate to asbestos and environmental  or a e  exposures 
within the annual loss reserve studies produced by our external actuaries  exposures for each subsidiary are separated into homogeneous reserving categories for the purpose of estimating ibnr 
each reserving category contains either direct insurance or assumed reinsurance reserves and groups relatively similar types of risks and exposures for example  asbestos  environmental  casualty  property and lines of business written for example  marine  aviation  non marine 
based on the exposure characteristics and the nature of available data for each individual reserving category  a number of methodologies are applied 
recorded reserves for each category are selected from the indications produced by the various methodologies after consideration of exposure characteristics  data limitations and strengths and weaknesses of each method applied 
this approach to estimating ibnr has been consistently adopted in the annual loss reserve studies for each period presented 
the ranges of gross loss and loss adjustment expense reserves implied by the various methodologies used by each of our insurance subsidiaries as of december  were low selected high in thousands of us dollars asbestos environmental all other unallocated loss adjustment expenses total latent claims our loss reserves are related largely to casualty exposures including latent exposures relating primarily to a e 
in establishing the reserves for unpaid claims  management considers facts currently known and the current state of the law and coverage litigation 
liabilities are recognized for known claims including the cost of related litigation when sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy  and management can reasonably estimate its liability 
in addition  reserves are established to cover loss development related to both known and unasserted claims 
the estimation of unpaid claim liabilities is subject to a high degree of uncertainty for a number of reasons 
first  unpaid claim liabilities for property and casualty exposures in general are impacted by changes in the legal environment  jury awards  medical cost trends and general inflation 
moreover  for latent exposures in particular  developed case law and adequate claim history do not exist 
there is significant coverage litigation related to these exposures  which creates further uncertainty in the estimation of the liabilities 
as a result  for these types of exposures  it is especially unclear whether past claim experience will be representative of future claim experience 

table of contents ultimate values for such claims cannot be estimated using reserving techniques that extrapolate losses to an ultimate basis using loss development factors  and the uncertainties surrounding the estimation of unpaid claim liabilities are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
there can be no assurance that the reserves established by us will be adequate or will not be adversely affected by the development of other latent exposures 
our asbestos claims are primarily products liability claims submitted by a variety of insureds who operated in different parts of the asbestos distribution chain 
while most such claims arise from asbestos mining and primary asbestos manufacturers  we have also been receiving claims from tertiary defendants such as smaller manufacturers  and the industry has seen an emerging trend of non products claims arising from premises exposures 
unlike products claims  primary policies generally do not contain aggregate policy limits for premises claims  which  accordingly  remain at the primary layer and  thus  rarely impact excess insurance policies 
as the vast majority of our policies are excess policies  this trend has had only a marginal effect on our asbestos exposures thus far 
asbestos reform efforts have been underway at both the federal and state level to address the cost and scope of asbestos claims to the american economy 
while congressional efforts to create a federal trust fund that would replace the tort system for asbestos claims failed  several states  including texas and florida  have passed reforms based on medical criteria requiring certain levels of medically documented injury before a lawsuit can be filed  generally resulting in a drop of case filings in those states adopting this reform measure 
asbestos claims primarily fall into two general categories impaired and unimpaired bodily injury claims 
property damage claims represent only a small fraction of asbestos claims 
impaired claims primarily include individuals suffering from mesothelioma or a cancer such as lung cancer 
unimpaired claims include asbestosis and those whose lung regions contain pleural plaques 
unlike traditional property and casualty insurers that either have large numbers of individual claims arising from personal lines such as auto  or small numbers of high value claims as in medical malpractice insurance lines  our primary exposures arise from a e claims that do not follow a consistent pattern 
for instance  we may encounter a small insured with one large environmental claim due to significant groundwater contamination  while a fortune company may submit numerous claims for relatively small values 
moreover  there is no set pattern for the life of an environmental or asbestos claim 
some of these claims may resolve within two years whereas others have remained unresolved for nearly two decades 
therefore  our open and closed claims data do not follow any identifiable or discernible pattern 
furthermore  because of the reinsurance nature of the claims we manage  we focus on the activities at the reinsured level rather than at the individual claims level 
the counterparties with whom we typically interact are generally insurers or large industrial concerns and not individual claimants 
claims do not follow any consistent pattern 
they arise from many insureds or locations and in a broad range of circumstances 
an insured may present one large claim or hundreds or thousands of small claims 
plaintiffs counsel frequently aggregate thousands of claims within one lawsuit 
the deductibles to which claims are subject vary from policy to policy and year to year 
often claims data is only available to reinsurers  such as us  on an aggregated basis 
accordingly  we have not found claim count information or average reserve amounts to be reliable indicators of exposure for our reserve estimation process or for management of our liabilities 
we have found data accumulation and claims management more effective and meaningful at the reinsured level rather than at the underlying claim level 
as a result  we have designed our reserving methodologies to be independent of claim count information 
as the level of exposures to a reinsured can vary substantially  we focus on the aggregate exposures and pursue commutations and policy buy backs with the larger reinsureds 
we employ approximately full time equivalent employees  including a us attorney  actuaries  and experienced claims handlers  to directly administer our a e liabilities 
we have established a provision for future expenses of million  which reflects the total anticipated costs to administer these claims to expiration 
our future environmental loss development may be influenced by other factors including existence of currently undiscovered polluted sites eligible for clean up under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla and related legislation 

table of contents costs imposed due to joint and several liability if not all potentially reliable parties prps are capable of paying their share 
success of legal challenges to certain policy terms such as the absolute pollution exclusion 
potential future reforms and amendments to cercla  particularly as the resources of superfund the funding vehicle  established as part of cercla  to provide financing for cleanup of polluted sites where no prp can be identified become exhausted 
the influence of each of these factors is not easily quantifiable and  as with asbestos related exposures  our historical environmental loss development is of limited value in determining future environmental loss development using traditional actuarial reserving techniques 
there have been recent positive developments concerning lead paint liability  an area previously viewed as an emerging trend in latent claim activity with the potential to adversely affect reserves 
after a series of successful defense efforts by defendant lead pigment manufacturers in lead paint litigation  in  a rhode island trial court ruled in favor of the government in a nuisance claim against the defendant manufacturers 
since the rhode island decision  other government entities have employed the same theory for recovery against these manufacturers 
in  the rhode island supreme court reversed the sole legal liability loss experienced by lead pigment manufacturers in lead paint litigation 
the court rejected public nuisance as a viable theory of liability for use by the government against the defendants and thus invalidated the entire claim against the lead pigment manufacturers 
subsequent to the rhode island supreme court decision at least one other government entity  an ohio municipality  voluntarily dropped its lead paint suit 
thereafter  the state of ohio  voluntarily dismissed its pending action against lead pigment manufacturers 
other state supreme courts equally rejected the public nuisance theory of liability  whereas no highest state court has ever adopted this theory as an acceptable cause of action 
we believe that lead paint claims now pose a lower risk to adverse reserve adjustment than previously thought  as the only trial court decision against lead pigment manufacturers to date was reversed on the basis that public nuisance is an improper liability theory by which a plaintiff may seek recovery against the lead pigment manufacturers 
even if adverse rulings under alternative theories succeed or if other states ultimately permit recovery under a public nuisance theory  it is questionable whether insureds have coverage under their policies under which they seek indemnity 
insureds have yet to meet policy terms and conditions to establish coverage for lead paint public nuisance claims  as opposed to traditional bodily injury and property damage claims 
still  there is the potential for significant impact to excess insurers should plaintiffs prevail in successive nuisance claims pending in other jurisdictions and coverage is established 
our independent  external actuaries use industry benchmarking methodologies to estimate appropriate ibnr reserves for our a e exposures 
these methods are based on comparisons of our loss experience on a e exposures relative to industry loss experience on a e exposures 
estimates of ibnr are derived separately for each of our relevant subsidiaries and  for some subsidiaries  separately for distinct portfolios of exposure 
the discussion that follows describes  in greater detail  the primary actuarial methodologies used by our independent actuaries to estimate ibnr for a e exposures 
in addition to the specific considerations for each method described below  many general factors are considered in the application of the methods and the interpretation of results for each portfolio of exposures 
these factors include the mix of product types eg  primary insurance versus reinsurance of primary versus reinsurance of reinsurance  the average attachment point of coverages eg  first dollar primary versus umbrella over primary versus high excess  payment and reporting lags related to the international domicile of our subsidiaries  payment and reporting pattern acceleration due to large wholesale settlements eg  policy buy backs and commutations pursued by us  lists of individual risks remaining and general trends within the legal and tort environments 
paid survival ratio method 
in this method  our expected annual average payment amount is multiplied by an expected future number of payment years to get an indicated reserve 
our historical calendar year payments are examined to determine an expected future annual average payment amount 
this amount is multiplied by an expected number of future payment years to estimate a reserve 
trends in calendar year payment activity are considered when selecting an expected future annual average payment amount 
accepted industry benchmarks are 
table of contents used in determining an expected number of future payment years 
each year  annual payments data is updated  trends in payments are re evaluated and changes to benchmark future payment years are reviewed 
this method has advantages of ease of application and simplicity of assumptions 
a potential disadvantage of the method is that results could be misleading for portfolios of high excess exposures where significant payment activity has not yet begun 
paid market share method 
in this method  our estimated market share is applied to the industry estimated unpaid losses 
the ratio of our historical calendar year payments to industry historical calendar year payments is examined to estimate our market share 
this ratio is then applied to the estimate of industry unpaid losses 
each year  calendar year payment data is updated for both us and industry  estimates of industry unpaid losses are reviewed and the selection of our estimated market share is revisited 
this method has the advantage that trends in calendar year market share can be incorporated into the selection of company share of remaining market payments 
a potential disadvantage of this method is that it is particularly sensitive to assumptions regarding the time lag between industry payments and our payments 
reserve to paid method 
in this method  the ratio of estimated industry reserves to industry paid to date losses is multiplied by our paid to date losses to estimate our reserves 
specific considerations in the application of this method include the completeness of our paid to date loss information  the potential acceleration or deceleration in our payments relative to the industry due to our claims handling practices  and the impact of large individual settlements 
each year  paid to date loss information is updated for both us and the industry and updates to industry estimated reserves are reviewed 
this method has the advantage of relying purely on paid loss data and so is not influenced by subjectivity of case reserve loss estimates 
a potential disadvantage is that the application to our portfolios which do not have complete inception to date paid loss history could produce misleading results 
to address this potential disadvantage  a variation of the method is also considered by multiplying the ratio of estimated industry reserves to industry losses paid during a recent period of time eg  years times our paid losses during that period 
ibnr case ratio method 
in this method  the ratio of estimated industry ibnr reserves to industry case reserves is multiplied by our case reserves to estimate our ibnr reserves 
specific considerations in the application of this method include the presence of policies reserved at policy limits  changes in overall industry case reserve adequacy and recent loss reporting history for us 
each year  our case reserves are updated  industry reserves are updated and the applicability of the industry ibnr case ratio is reviewed 
this method has the advantage that it incorporates the most recent estimates of amounts needed to settle open cases included in current case reserves 
a potential disadvantage is that results could be misleading where our case reserve adequacy differs significantly from overall industry case reserve adequacy 
ultimate to incurred method 
in this method  the ratio of estimated industry ultimate losses to industry incurred to date losses is applied to our incurred to date losses to estimate our ibnr reserves 
specific considerations in the application of this method include the completeness of our incurred to date loss information  the potential acceleration or deceleration in our incurred losses relative to the industry due to our claims handling practices and the impact of large individual settlements 
each year incurred to date loss information is updated for both us and the industry and updates to industry estimated ultimate losses are reviewed 
this method has the advantage that it incorporates both paid and case reserve information in projecting ultimate losses 
a potential disadvantage is that results could be misleading where cumulative paid loss data is incomplete or where our case reserve adequacy differs significantly from overall industry case reserve adequacy 
under the paid survival ratio method  the paid market share method and the reserve to paid method  we first determine the estimated total reserve and then deduct the reported outstanding case reserves to arrive at an estimated ibnr reserve 
the ibnr case ratio method first determines an estimated ibnr reserve which is then added to the advised outstanding case reserves to arrive at an estimated total loss reserve 
the ultimate to incurred method first determines an estimate of the ultimate losses to be paid and then deducts paid to date losses to arrive at an estimated total loss reserve and then deducts outstanding case reserves to arrive at the estimated ibnr reserve 
within the annual loss reserve studies produced by our external actuaries  exposures for each subsidiary are separated into homogeneous reserving categories for the purpose of estimating ibnr 
each reserving category contains either direct insurance or assumed reinsurance reserves and groups relatively similar types of risks and 
table of contents exposures eg  asbestos  environmental  casualty and property and lines of business written eg  marine  aviation and non marine 
based on the exposure characteristics and the nature of available data for each individual reserving category  a number of methodologies are applied 
recorded reserves for each category are selected from the indications produced by the various methodologies after consideration of exposure characteristics  data limitations  and strengths and weaknesses of each method applied 
this approach to estimating ibnr has been consistently adopted in the annual loss reserve studies for each period presented 
as of december   we had separate insurance and or reinsurance subsidiaries whose reserves are categorized into approximately reserve categories in total  including distinct asbestos reserving categories and distinct environmental reserving categories 
to the extent that data availability allows  the five methodologies described above are applied for each of the asbestos reserving categories and each of the environmental reserving categories 
as is common in actuarial practice  no one methodology is exclusively or consistently relied upon when selecting a recorded reserve 
consistent reliance on a single methodology to select a recorded reserve would be inappropriate in light of the dynamic nature of both the a e liabilities in general  and our actual exposure portfolios in particular 
in selecting a recorded reserve  management considers the range of results produced by the methods  and the strengths and weaknesses of the methods in relation to the data available and the specific characteristics of the portfolio under consideration 
trends in both our data and industry data are also considered in the reserve selection process 
recent trends or changes in the relevant tort and legal environments are also considered when assessing methodology results and selecting an appropriate recorded reserve amount for each portfolio 
the following key assumptions were used to estimate a e reserves at december  billion ultimate industry asbestos losses this level of industry wide losses and its comparison to industry wide paid  incurred and outstanding case reserves is the base benchmarking assumption applied to paid market share  reserve to paid  ibnr case ratio and the ultimate to incurred asbestos reserving methodologies 
billion ultimate industry environmental losses this level of industry wide losses and its comparison to industry wide paid  incurred and outstanding case reserves is the base benchmarking assumption applied to paid market share  reserve to paid  ibnr case ratio and the ultimate to incurred environmental reserving methodologies 
loss reporting lag our subsidiaries assumed a mix of insurance and reinsurance exposures generally through the london market 
as the available industry benchmark loss information  as supplied by our independent consulting actuaries  is compiled largely from us direct insurance company experience  our loss reporting is expected to lag relative to available industry benchmark information 
this time lag used by each of our insurance subsidiaries varies from to years depending on the relative mix of domicile  percentages of product mix of insurance  reinsurance and retrocessional reinsurance  primary insurance  excess insurance  reinsurance of direct  and reinsurance of reinsurance within any given exposure category 
exposure portfolios written from a non us domicile are assumed to have a greater time lag than portfolios written from a us domicile 
portfolios with a larger proportion of reinsurance exposures are assumed to have a greater time lag than portfolios with a larger proportion of insurance exposures 
the assumptions above as to ultimate industry asbestos and environmental losses have not changed from the immediately preceding period 
for our company as a whole  the average selected lag for asbestos has increased slightly from years to years and the average selected lag for environmental has decreased slightly from years to years 
the changes to the selected lags arose largely as a result of the acquisition of new portfolios of a e exposures 

table of contents the following tables provide a summary of the impact of changes in industry ultimate losses  from the selected billion for asbestos and billion for environmental  and changes in the time lag  from the selected averages of years for asbestos and years for environmental  for us behind industry development that it is assumed relates to our insurance and reinsurance companies 
please note that the table below demonstrates sensitivity to changes to key assumptions using methodologies selected for determining loss and allocated loss adjustment expenses  or alae  at december  and differs from the table on page  which demonstrates the range of outcomes produced by the various methodologies 
asbestos sensitivity to industry asbestos ultimate loss assumption loss reserves in thousands of us dollars asbestos billion asbestos billion selected asbestos billion environmental sensitivity to industry environmental ultimate loss assumption loss reserves in thousands of us dollars environmental billion environmental billion selected environmental billion asbestos environmental sensitivity to time lag assumption loss reserves loss reserves in thousands of us dollars selected average of years asbestos  years environmental increase all portfolio lags by six months decrease all portfolio lags by six months using billion billion asbestos environmental industry ultimate loss assumptions 
industry publications have  since  indicated that the range of ultimate industry losses is estimated to be between approximately billion and billion for asbestos losses 
one commonly referenced benchmark estimate has recently increased its estimate of ultimate industry asbestos losses from billion to billion 
one of the reasons cited for the increase in estimated industry ultimate asbestos losses is a shift of losses away from products liability claims to non products claims 
in considering the impact of this issue  it is important to understand how asbestos claims attach to policies issued by the insurance industry in general and the policies issued by the companies owned by us in particular 
historically  asbestos claims have been presented as products liability claims brought against manufacturers and distributors of asbestos containing products 
for a given manufacturer  distributor  or other entity involved in asbestos litigation  multiple claims are filed by numerous individuals 
there is typically an allocation of the settlement costs for asbestos claims over time based on exposure to asbestos by the injured claimants 
many asbestos claims will aggregate within each individual policy period to exhaust the annual aggregate policy limits which exist within policies sold to cover products liability claims 
beginning in the mid s  a trend began to emerge whereby certain policyholders began to assert that their asbestos claims should not fall within the products liability section of their policies and  therefore  should not be subject to the aggregate limits of products liability claims 
instead  the policyholder would assert that each individual bodily injury claim should be treated as a separate occurrence under the premises operations section of their policies 
under such presentation  individual claim or occurrence limits apply separately to each claim and there is no aggregate limit for the amount of premises or non products claims within a particular policy 

table of contents our exposure to asbestos losses arises largely from direct excess policies and assumed reinsurance policies written through the london market 
with respect to direct excess policies  our companies typically participated on policies whereby liability would only attach in excess of primary and umbrella policy limits 
as non products asbestos losses are not aggregated and are generally confined to the limits of the primary and other lower layer insurance policies  we believe we have very little exposure to non products asbestos losses through direct insurance policies issued by our owned subsidiary companies 
to date  we have seen no material reporting of non products asbestos claims on direct insurance policies 
the trend of asbestos losses shifting from products to non products is not a new phenomenon 
as our insurance entities have not received any material reporting of non products claims to date and their direct insurance exposures are generally in excess of the layers of insurance impacted by non products asbestos losses  we do not expect any material future liability in respect of non products asbestos claims 
losses with respect to assumed reinsurance exposures to non products asbestos claims are unlikely to be aggregated and are generally confined to the limits of the primary and other lower layer insurance policies 
there is limited ability for such claims to exceed retained levels 
our assumed reinsurance portfolio with respect to asbestos exposures is largely excess of loss in nature and  therefore  not especially subject to non products asbestos liabilities 
to date  we have seen no material reporting of non products asbestos claims on assumed reinsurance policies 
as stated above  the trend of asbestos losses shifting from products to non products is not a new phenomenon 
as our assumed reinsurance entities have not received any material reporting of non products claims to date and their assumed reinsurance exposures generally cover layers of insurance not impacted by non products asbestos losses  management does not expect any material future liability in respect of non products asbestos claims 
other reasons cited for the increase in estimated industry ultimate asbestos losses include the ongoing uncertainty surrounding insurance coverage of asbestos claims and the ongoing reporting of significant numbers and values of malignant mesothelioma claims 
as we do not view these issues as new information any impact has already been factored into our actuarial reserving methodologies with no need for any change in assumptions 
furthermore  in recent years  the overall asbestos loss development trend within our portfolio has been favorable 
our asbestos exposures are reviewed by independent actuaries on an annual basis as part of the overall annual loss reserve review 
actual loss reporting for asbestos claims in recent years has been below actuarial estimated expectations 
having considered the recent increase in one commonly referenced benchmark estimate of ultimate net asbestos losses in the context of our portfolio of loss exposures and actual asbestos loss reporting in recent years for us in particular  as well as for the insurance industry generally  we believe there is no need to increase the billion asbestos ultimate industry loss assumption 
guidance from industry publications is more varied in respect of estimates of ultimate industry environmental losses 
consistent with an industry published estimate  we believe the reasonable range for ultimate industry environmental losses is between billion and billion 
we have selected the midpoint of this range as the basis for our environmental loss reserving based on advice supplied by our independent consulting actuaries 
another industry publication has recently reduced its estimate of ultimate industry environmental losses from billion to billion 
based on our own loss experience  including successful settlement activity by us  the decline in new claims notified in recent years  improvements in environmental clean up technology and the reduced industry estimate  we believe that billion remains a reasonable basis for inclusion in our methodologies for reserving for environmental losses 
our current estimate of the time lag that relates to our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries compared to the industry is considered reasonable given the analysis performed by our internal and external actuaries to date 
over time  additional information regarding such exposure characteristics may be developed for any given portfolio 
this additional information could cause a shift in the lag assumed 

table of contents non latent claims for non latent loss exposure  a range of traditional loss development extrapolation techniques is applied 
incremental paid and incurred loss development methodologies are the most commonly used methods 
traditional cumulative paid and incurred loss development methods are used where inception to date  cumulative paid and reported incurred loss development history is available 
these methods assume that cohorts  or groups  of losses from similar exposures will increase over time in a predictable manner 
historical paid and incurred loss development experience is examined for earlier accident years to make inferences about how later accident years losses will develop 
where company specific loss information is not available or not reliable  industry loss development information published by industry sources such as the reinsurance association of america is considered 
these methods calculate an estimate of ultimate losses and then deduct paid to date losses to arrive at an estimated total loss reserve 
outstanding losses are then deducted from estimated total loss reserves to calculate the estimated ibnr reserve 
management does not expect changes in underlying reserving assumptions to have a material impact on net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as they are primarily sensitive to changes due to loss development 
quarterly reserve reviews in addition to an in depth annual review  we also perform quarterly reserve reviews 
this is done by examining quarterly paid and incurred loss development to determine whether it is consistent with reserves established during the preceding annual reserve review and with expected development 
loss development is reviewed separately for each major exposure type eg  asbestos  environmental  etc  for each of our relevant subsidiaries  and for large wholesale commutation settlements versus routine paid and advised losses 
this process is undertaken to determine whether loss development experience during a quarter warrants any change to held reserves 
loss development is examined separately by exposure type because different exposures develop differently over time 
for example  the expected reporting and payout of losses for a given amount of asbestos reserves can be expected to take place over a different time frame and in a different quarterly pattern from the same amount of environmental reserves 
in addition  loss development is examined separately for each of our relevant subsidiaries 
companies can differ in their exposure profile due to the mix of insurance versus reinsurance  the mix of primary versus excess insurance  the underwriting years of participation and other criteria 
these differing profiles lead to different expectations for quarterly and annual loss development by company 
our quarterly paid and incurred loss development is often driven by large  wholesale settlements such as commutations and policy buy backs which settle many individual claims in a single transaction 
this allows for monitoring of the potential profitability of large settlements which  in turn  can provide information about the adequacy of reserves on remaining exposures which have not yet been settled 
for example  if it were found that large settlements were consistently leading to large negative  or favorable  incurred losses upon settlement  it might be an indication that reserves on remaining exposures are redundant 
conversely  if it were found that large settlements were consistently leading to large positive  or adverse  incurred losses upon settlement  it might be an indication particularly if the size of the losses were increasing that certain loss reserves on remaining exposures are deficient 
moreover  removing the loss development resulting from large settlements allows for a review of loss development related only to those contracts which remain exposed to losses 
were this not done  it is possible that savings on large wholesale settlements could mask significant underlying development on remaining exposures 
once the data has been analyzed as described above  an in depth review is performed on classes of exposure with significant loss development 
discussions are held with appropriate personnel  including individual company managers  claims handlers and attorneys  to better understand the causes 
if it were determined that development differs significantly from expectations  reserves would be adjusted 
quarterly loss development is expected to be fairly erratic for the types of exposure insured and reinsured by us 
several quarters of low incurred loss development can be followed by spikes of relatively large incurred losses 
this is characteristic of latent claims and other insurance losses which are reported and settled many years after the 
table of contents inception of the policy 
given the high degree of statistical uncertainty  and potential volatility  it would be unusual to adjust reserves on the basis of one  or even several  quarters of loss development activity 
as a result  unless the incurred loss activity in any one quarter is of such significance that management is able to quantify the impact on the ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses  reductions or increases in loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities are carried out in the fourth quarter based on the annual reserve review described above 
as described above  our management regularly reviews and updates reserve estimates using the most current information available and employing various actuarial methods 
adjustments resulting from changes in our estimates are recorded in the period when such adjustments are determined 
the ultimate liability for loss and loss adjustment expenses is likely to differ from the original estimate due to a number of factors  primarily consisting of the overall claims activity occurring during any period  including the completion of commutations of assumed liabilities and ceded reinsurance receivables  policy buy backs and general incurred claims activity 
reinsurance balances receivable our acquired reinsurance subsidiaries  prior to acquisition by us  used retrocessional agreements to reduce their exposure to the risk of insurance and reinsurance they assumed 
loss reserves represent total gross losses  and reinsurance receivables represent anticipated recoveries of a portion of those unpaid losses as well as amounts receivable from reinsurers with respect to claims that have already been paid 
while reinsurance arrangements are designed to limit losses and to permit recovery of a portion of direct unpaid losses  reinsurance does not relieve us of our liabilities to our insureds or reinsureds 
therefore  we evaluate and monitor concentration of credit risk among our reinsurers  including companies that are insolvent  in run off or facing financial difficulties 
provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible 
at december  and  the provision for uncollectible reinsurance relating to losses recoverable was million and million  respectively 
to estimate the provision for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable  the reinsurance recoverable is first allocated to applicable reinsurers 
this determination is based on a detailed process rather than an estimate  although an element of judgment is applied 
as part of this process  ceded ibnr is allocated by reinsurer 
we use a detailed analysis to estimate uncollectible reinsurance 
the primary components of the analysis are reinsurance recoverable balances by reinsurer and bad debt provisions applied to these balances to determine the portion of a reinsurer s balance deemed to be uncollectible 
these provisions require considerable judgment and are determined using the current rating  or rating equivalent  of each reinsurer in order to determine its ability to settle the reinsurance balances as well as other key considerations and assumptions  such as claims and coverage issues 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for an analysis of reinsurance recoverables 
provisions for unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities provisions for unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities are estimated by management by determining the future annual costs to be incurred by us  comprising staff costs  consultancy and professional fees and overheads  in managing the run off of claims liabilities for each of our insurance and reinsurance entities 
the provision is reviewed quarterly and reduced in accordance with the related costs incurred each period 
fair value measurements the following is a summary of valuation techniques or models we use to measure fair value by asset and liability classes  which have not changed significantly since december  fixed maturity investments our fixed maturity portfolio is managed by our chief investment officer and our outside investment advisors 
we use inputs from nationally recognized pricing services  including pricing vendors  index providers and broker dealers to estimate fair value measurements for all of our fixed maturity investments 
these pricing services include ft interactive data  barclays capital aggregate index formerly lehman index  reuters pricing service and others 

table of contents in general  the independent pricing services use observable market inputs including  but not limited to  investment yields  credit risks and spreads  benchmark curves  benchmarking of like securities  non binding broker dealer quotes  reported trades and sector groupings to determine the fair value 
in addition  pricing services use valuation models  such as an option adjusted spread model  to develop prepayment and interest rate scenarios 
the option adjusted spread model is commonly used to estimate fair value for securities such as mortgage backed and asset backed securities 
with the exception of two securities held within our trading portfolio  the fair value estimates of our fixed maturity investments are based on observable market data 
we have therefore included these as level investments within the fair value hierarchy 
the two securities in our trading portfolio that do not have observable inputs have been included as level investments within the fair value hierarchy 
to validate the techniques or models used by the pricing services  we compare the fair value estimates to our knowledge of the current market and will challenge any prices deemed not to be representative of fair value 
as of december   there were no material differences between the prices obtained from the pricing services and the fair value estimates developed by us 
in evaluating credit losses  we consider a variety of factors in the assessment of a fixed maturity investment including the time period during which there has been a significant decline below cost  the extent of the decline below cost and par  the potential for the fixed maturity investment to recover in value  an analysis of the financial condition of the issuer  the rating of the issuer  and failure of the issuer of the fixed maturity investment to make scheduled interest or principal payments 
based on the factors described above  we determined that  as of december   no credit losses existed 
equity securities our equity securities are managed by two external advisors 
through these third parties  we use nationally recognized pricing services  including pricing vendors  index providers and broker dealers to estimate fair value measurements for all of our equity securities 
these pricing services include ft interactive data and others 
we have categorized all of our investments in common stock as level investments because the fair values of these securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
we have categorized all of our investments in preferred stock as level except one which was categorized as level because their fair value estimates are based on observable market data 
other investments for our investments in private equities  we measure fair value by obtaining the most recently published net asset value as advised by the external fund manager or third party administrator 
the use of net asset value as an estimate of the fair value for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value is a permitted practical expedient 
our private equity investments are mainly in the financial services industry 
the fund advisors continue to evaluate the overall market environment  as well as specific areas in the financial services sector  in order to identify segments that they believe will offer the most attractive investment opportunities 
the financial statements of each fund generally are audited annually under us gaap  using fair value measurement for the underlying investments 
for all publicly traded companies within the funds  we have valued those investments based on the latest share price 
the value of affirmative investment llc in which we own a non voting membership interest is based on the market value of the shares of affirmative insurance holdings  inc  a publicly traded company 
all of our investments in private equities are subject to restrictions on redemptions and sales that are determined by the governing documents and limit our ability to liquidate those investments in the short term 
the capital commitments are discussed in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have classified our private equities as level investments because they reflect our own judgment about the assumptions that market participants might use 

table of contents for our investment in the hedge fund  we measure fair value by obtaining the most recently published net asset value as advised by the external fund manager or third party administrator 
the use of net asset value as an estimate of the fair value for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value is a permitted practical expedient 
the adviser of the fund intends to seek attractive risk adjusted total returns for the fund s investors by acquiring  originating  and actively managing a diversified portfolio of debt securities  with a focus on various forms of asset backed securities and loans 
the fund will focus on investments that the adviser believes to be fundamentally undervalued with current market prices that are believed to be compelling relative to intrinsic value 
the units of account that are valued by us are our interests in the fund and not the underlying holdings of the fund 
thus  the inputs used to value our investments in the fund may differ from the inputs used to value the underlying holdings of the fund 
the hedge fund is not currently eligible for redemption due to imposed lock up periods of three years from the time of the initial investment 
once eligible  redemptions will be permitted quarterly with days notice 
there are no unfunded capital commitments in relation to the hedge fund 
the investment in the fund is classified as level in the fair value hierarchy 
the bond funds have been classified as level investments because their fair value is estimated using the net asset value reported by bloomberg and they have daily liquidity 
for the year ended december   the share of net earnings on our other investments was million as compared to million for the year ended december  any unrealized losses or gains on our other investments are included as part of our net investment income 
the following table summarizes all of our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at december   by hierarchy established by the fair value measurement and disclosure topic of fasb asc december  quoted prices in significant significant active markets for other observable unobservable identical assets inputs inputs total fair level level level value in thousands of us dollars us government and agency non us government corporate municipal residential mortgage backed commercial mortgage backed asset backed equities other investments total investments as a percentage of total assets goodwill we follow the provisions of the intangibles goodwill and other topic of fasb asc  which requires that recorded goodwill be assessed for impairment on at least an annual basis 
in determining goodwill  we must determine the fair value of the assets of an acquired company 
the determination of fair value necessarily involves many assumptions 
fair values of reinsurance assets and liabilities acquired are derived from probability weighted ranges of the associated projected cash flows  based on actuarially prepared information and our management run off strategy 
fair value adjustments are based on the estimated timing of loss and loss adjustment expense payments and an assumed interest rate  and are amortized over the estimated payout period  as adjusted for accelerations on commutation settlements  using the constant yield method option 
interest rates used to determine the fair value of gross loss reserves are based upon risk free rates applicable to the average duration of the loss reserves 
interest rates used to determine the fair value of reinsurance receivables are increased to reflect the credit risk associated with the 
table of contents reinsurers from which the receivables are  or will become  due 
if the assumptions made in initially valuing the assets change significantly in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
asc also requires that negative goodwill be recorded in earnings 
during  we took negative goodwill into earnings upon the completion of the acquisition of certain companies and presented it as an extraordinary gain 
asc requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date 
asc also requires the acquirer to recognize acquisition related costs separately from the acquisition  recognize assets acquired and liabilities assumed arising from contractual contingencies at their acquisition date fair values and recognize goodwill as the excess of the consideration transferred plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
asc applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  january  for calendar year end companies

internal management fees of million and million were paid for the years ended december  and  respectively  by our reinsurance companies to our consulting companies 
the increase in internal fees paid to the consulting segment was due primarily to additional fees paid by reinsurance companies relating to allocated charges for increases in salary and general and administrative expenses

fair value measurements in accordance with the provisions of the fair value measurement and disclosure topic of the codification  we have categorized our investments that are recorded at fair value among levels as follows december  quoted prices in active markets significant other significant for identical assets observable inputs unobservable inputs total fair level level level value in thousands of us dollars us government and agency non us government corporate municipal residential mortgage backed commercial mortgage backed asset backed equities other investments total investments

net reduction in ibnr represents the change in our actuarial estimates of losses incurred but not reported 
the net reduction in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense liabilities for the year ended december  of million was attributable to a reduction in estimates of net ultimate losses of million  a reduction in aggregate provisions for bad debts of million and a reduction in estimates of unallocated loss adjustment expense liabilities of million  relating to run off activity  partially offset by the amortization  over the estimated payout period  of fair value adjustments relating to companies acquired amounting to million 
the reduction in estimates of net ultimate losses of million comprised net incurred favorable loss development of million and reductions in ibnr reserves of million 
the decrease in the estimate of ibnr loss reserves of million was comprised of million relating to asbestos liabilities  million relating to environmental liabilities and million relating to all other remaining liabilities 
the reduction in ibnr was a result of the application  on a basis consistent with the assumptions applied in the prior period  of our actuarial methodologies to loss data to estimate loss reserves required to cover liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the prior period estimate of net ibnr liabilities was reduced as a result of the combined impact of loss development activity during  including commutations and the favorable trend of loss development related to non commuted policies compared to prior forecasts 
the net incurred favorable loss development of million  resulting from settlement of net advised case and lae reserves of million for net paid losses of million  related to the settlement of non commuted losses in the year and approximately commutations of assumed and ceded exposures 

table of contents commutations provide an opportunity for us to exit exposures to entire policies with insureds and reinsureds at a discount to the previous estimated ultimate liability 
as a result of exiting all exposures to such policies  all advised case reserves and ibnr liabilities relating to that insured or reinsured are eliminated 
this often results in a net gain irrespective of whether the settlement exceeds the advised case reserves 
we adopt a disciplined approach to the review and settlement of non commuted claims through claims adjusting and the inspection of underlying policyholder records such that settlements of assumed exposures may often be achieved below the level of the originally advised loss  and settlements of ceded receivables may often be achieved at levels above carried balances 
of the commutations completed during  three related to our top ten insured and or reinsured exposures  including one commutation completed shortly after december  whereby the related reduction in ibnr reserves was recorded in the reduction in net ultimate losses for the year ended december   and one related to the commutation of one of our largest ceded reinsurance assets 
the remaining commutations  of which approximately were completed during the three months ended december   were of a smaller size  consistent with our approach of targeting significant numbers of cedant and reinsurer relationships  as well as targeting significant individual cedant and reinsurer relationships 
the combination of the claims settlement activity in  including commutations but excluding the impact of the commutation that was completed subsequent to the year ended december  and the actuarial estimation of ibnr reserves required for the remaining non commuted exposures which took into account the favorable trend of loss development in related to such exposures compared to prior forecasts  resulted in our management concluding that the loss development activity that occurred subsequent to the prior reporting period provided sufficient new information to warrant a reduction in ibnr reserves of million in the reduction in aggregate provisions for bad debt of million was a result of the collection  primarily during the three months ended december   of certain reinsurance receivables against which bad debt provisions had been provided in earlier periods

table of contents net foreign exchange gain loss year ended december  variance in thousands of us dollars consulting reinsurance total we recorded a foreign exchange gain of million for the year ended december   as compared to a foreign exchange loss of million for the year ended december  in october  we entered into a foreign currency forward exchange contract as part of our overall foreign currency risk management strategy

the contract exchange rate is au for 
as at december   the fair value of the contract was million  the effect of which we have recognized as a foreign exchange loss included as part of our net earnings 
this loss was offset by foreign exchange gains of approximately million arising primarily from our holdings of surplus british pounds and australian dollars at a time when these currencies were appreciating against the us dollar 
for the year ended december   million including noncontrolling interest s share of million of the foreign exchange loss arose primarily as a result of holding surplus us dollar denominated assets by gordian  our australian subsidiary  at a time when the us dollar had weakened significantly against the australian dollar 
excluding the foreign exchange loss in gordian of million  exchange gains of million were generated during the year ended december  primarily as a result of our holding surplus british pounds relating to cash collateral required to support british pound denominated letters of credit required by uk regulators at a time when the british pound exchange rate to the us dollar had increased from approximately as at january  to as at december  since letters of credit were in excess of the british pound liabilities held by our subsidiaries  the subsidiary companies were unable to match the surplus assets against liabilities during the year  resulting in the foreign exchange gain 
in addition to the foreign exchange gain we recorded in our consolidated statement of earnings for the year ended december   we recorded in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income foreign currency translation adjustment gains for the year ended december  of approximately million  as compared to gains of approximately million for the year ended december  we have concluded that under the foreign currency matters topic of the fasb asc the functional currency of gordian is australian dollars 
as a result  upon conversion of the net australian dollar assets of gordian to us dollars  we recorded million  net of noncontrolling interest of million  of us dollar foreign currency translation adjustment gains through accumulated other comprehensive income 
this gain was due primarily to the appreciation in the australian to us dollar foreign exchange rate from au as at december   to au at december  as our functional currency is the us dollar  we seek to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange by broadly matching foreign currency assets against foreign currency liabilities  subject to regulatory constraints

liquidity and capital resources as we are a holding company and have no substantial operations of our own  our assets consist primarily of investments in subsidiaries 
the potential sources of the cash flows to the holding company consist of dividends  advances and loans from our subsidiary companies 
our future cash flows depend upon the availability of dividends or other statutorily permissible payments from our subsidiaries 
the ability to pay dividends and make other distributions is limited by the applicable laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries operate  including bermuda  the united kingdom  united states  australia and europe  which subject these subsidiaries to significant regulatory restrictions 
these laws and regulations require  among other things  certain of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum solvency requirements and limit the amount of dividends and other payments that these subsidiaries can pay to us  which in turn may limit our ability to pay dividends and make other payments 
as of december  and  one of our us insurance companies was not in compliance with its applicable risk based capital level 
we do not believe this company s non compliance will have a material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations 
with the exception of the above  all of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries solvency and liquidity were in excess of the minimum levels required as of december  and retained earnings of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries are not currently restricted as minimum capital solvency margins are covered by share capital and additional paid in capital 
our capital management strategy is to preserve sufficient capital to enable us to make future acquisitions while maintaining a conservative investment strategy 
we believe that restrictions on liquidity resulting from restrictions 
table of contents on the payments of dividends by our subsidiary companies will not have a material impact on our ability to meet our cash obligations 
our sources of funds primarily consist of the cash and investment portfolios acquired on the completion of the acquisition of an insurance or reinsurance company in run off 
these acquired cash and investment balances are classified as cash provided by investing activities 
we expect to use these funds acquired  together with collections from reinsurance debtors  consulting income  investment income and proceeds from sales and redemption of investments  to pay losses and loss expenses  salaries and benefits and general and administrative expenses  with the remainder used for acquisitions and additional investments 
we expect that our reinsurance segment will have a net use of cash from operations as total net claim settlements and operating expenses will generally be in excess of investment income earned 
we expect that our consulting segment operating cash flows will generally be breakeven 
we expect our operating cash flows  together with our existing capital base and cash and investments acquired on the acquisition of our insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries  to be sufficient to meet cash requirements and to operate our business 
we currently do not intend to pay cash dividends on our ordinary shares 
we maintain a short duration conservative investment strategy whereby  as of december   of our fixed maturity portfolio classified as available for sale or trading was held with a maturity of less than one year and had maturities of less than five years 
excluding the impact of commutations and any schemes of arrangement  should they be completed  we expect approximately of the gross reserves to be settled within one year and approximately of the reserves to be settled within five years 
however  our strategy of commuting our liabilities has the potential to accelerate the natural payout of losses to less than five years 
therefore  the relatively short duration investment portfolio is maintained in order to provide liquidity for commutation opportunities and preclude us from having to liquidate longer dated securities 
as a result  we do not anticipate having to sell longer dated investments in order to meet future policyholder liabilities 
at december   total cash and investments were billion  compared to billion at december  reinsurance recoverables our acquired reinsurance subsidiaries  prior to acquisition by us  used retrocessional agreements to reduce their exposure to the risk of reinsurance assumed 
we remain liable to the extent that retrocessionaires do not meet their obligations under these agreements  and therefore  we evaluate and monitor concentration of credit risk 
provisions are made for amounts considered potentially uncollectible 
the allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable was million and million at december  and  respectively 
as of december  and  we had total reinsurance recoverables of million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  were associated with two and three reinsurers rated aa or higher by a major rating agency  respectively  which each represented or more of total reinsurance balances receivable 
in the event that all or any of the reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations under existing reinsurance agreements  we will be liable for such defaulted amounts 
one major aa rated reinsurer was included in the figure for reinsurers each representing or more of total reinsurance balances receivable but  for the year ended december   is now excluded as its balance receivable is now less than of the total reinsurance balance receivable 
during and  we completed six and two acquisitions  respectively  of insurance companies in run off and entered into eight and one acquisitions of portfolios of insurance and reinsurance businesses in run off  respectively 
these transactions included the acquisition of additional reinsurance balances receivable together with the related provisions for uncollectible reinsurance 
the aggregate provision for uncollectible reinsurance recoverable at december  amounted to approximately of the total reinsurance recoverables balance  before provisions for uncollectible reinsurance  compared to approximately at december  the overall bad debt provision percentage on the reinsurance asset has decreased as new acquisitions during have lower bad debt provisions than that established as at december  
table of contents source of funds we primarily generate our cash from the acquisitions we complete 
these acquired cash and investment balances are classified as cash provided by investing activities 
we expect that for the reinsurance segment there will be a net use of cash from operations due to total claim settlements and operating expenses being in excess of investment income earned and that for the consulting segment operating cash flows will be breakeven 
as a result  the net operating cash flows for us  to expiry  are expected to be negative as we pay out cash in claims settlements and expenses in excess of cash generated via investment income and consulting fees
