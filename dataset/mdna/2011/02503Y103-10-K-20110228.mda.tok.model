our consolidated financial performance  as reflected in our consolidated statements of operations  is composed of the following three primary elements the first element is net operating income  which is primarily the interest  dividends  prepayment fees  finance and transaction fees and portfolio company management fees earned from investing in debt and equity securities and the fees we earn from fund asset management  less our operating expenses and provision for income taxes 
the second element is net realized gain loss on investments  which reflects the difference between the proceeds from an exit of an investment and the cost at which the investment was carried on our consolidated balance sheets and periodic interest settlements and termination receipts or payments on derivatives  foreign currency transaction gains or losses and income taxes on realized gains 
the third element is net unrealized appreciation depreciation of investments  which is the net change in the estimated fair value of our portfolio investments and of our interest rate derivatives at the end of the period compared with their estimated fair values at the beginning of the period or their stated costs  as appropriate 
in addition  our net unrealized depreciation of investments includes the foreign currency translation from converting the cost basis of our assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency to the us dollar 
the consolidated operating results for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions operating income operating expenses operating income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net operating income net gain on extinguishment of debt net realized loss gain on investments net realized loss earnings net unrealized appreciation depreciation of investments net earnings loss fiscal year compared to fiscal year operating income we derive the majority of our operating income by investing in senior and mezzanine debt and equity of middle market companies with attractive current yields and or potential for equity appreciation and realized gains 
we also derive operating income from investing in structured products

interest income on debt and structured products investments decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   over the comparable prior period in  due to a decrease in our monthly weighted average debt and structured products investments and a decrease in interest income recognized on our cmbs investments  partially offset by a decline in non accruing loans 
our spread income  the weighted average rate of interest income on debt and structured products investments less the weighted average interest rate on our corporate debt obligations  increased from in to in this was due in part to a decline in libor  a decrease in the spread of our new secured debt due in  the exit of non performing debt and structured products investments and new investments with higher average yields 
our weighted average debt and structured products investments decreased for the year ended december  over the comparable period in primarily as a result of the repayment  sale or write off of debt and structured products investments 
the monthly weighted average effective interest rate on our debt and structured products investments increased basis points during the year ended december  over the comparable period in primarily due to a greater negative impact of non accrual debt investments for the year ended december  as compared to the current period and an approximate million decrease in the average cost basis of non accrual loans during the year december  over the comparable period in  partially offset by a decline in interest income recognized from cmbs investments as compared to the prior period as a result of a decrease in projected cash flow 
see note interest and dividend income recognition policy in this annual report on form k for a description of how projected cash flows affect revenue recognition on our structured products investments 
when a debt investment is placed on non accrual  we may record reserves on uncollected pik interest income recorded in prior periods as a reduction of interest income in the current period 
conversely  when a debt investment is removed from non accrual  we record interest income in the current period on prior period uncollected pik interest income which was reserved in prior periods 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded a net reserve on uncollected pik interest income recorded in prior periods of million and million  respectively  as a result of debt investments being placed on non accrual  which had an approximate basis point and basis point  respectively  negative impact on the weighted average effective interest rate 
dividend income decreased by million  or  for the year ended december   over the comparable period in primarily due to a decline in dividends from common stock investments that were sold 
as a result  the monthly weighted average effective dividend yield on equity investments was for the year ended december   a basis point decrease from the comparable period in when a preferred equity investment is placed on non accrual  we may record net reserves on uncollected accrued dividend income recorded in prior periods as a reduction of dividend income in the current period 
conversely  when a preferred equity investment is removed from non accrual  we record dividend income in the current period for prior period uncollected accrued dividend income which was reserved in prior periods

the weighted average interest rate on all of our borrowings  including amortization of deferred financing costs  for the year ended december  was  compared to for the year ended december  comparison to the prior year of the weighted average interest is also impacted by additional interest expense incurred during the year ended december  for the accrual of a million make whole interest payment on our unsecured debt that was refinanced in the second quarter of our weighted average borrowings decreased to  million for the year ended december  from  million in the comparable period in  and our year end borrowings decreased from  million as of december  to  million as of december  salaries  benefits and stock based compensation salaries  benefits and stock based compensation consisted of the following for the years ended december  and in millions base salaries incentive compensation severance costs benefits stock based compensation total salaries  benefits and stock based compensation salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for the year ended december  decreased million  or  over the comparable period in primarily due to i a decrease in the number of employees  ii severance costs recorded in the prior year and iii lower stock based compensation during the year ended december  as a result of the acceleration of stock based compensation in the fourth quarter of from the completion of a tender offer for certain eligible employee stock options 
in  we granted million stock options with a weighted average fair value of per option  or million  and in  we granted million stock options with a weighted average fair value of per option  or million 
in  we did not grant any deferred compensation  and in  we granted million of deferred compensation 
for a further discussion on stock based compensation  see note and note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k

for each tendered option  non executive officer employees received a cash payment of per eligible stock option and executive officer employees received per eligible stock option 
for a further discussion on the tender offer  see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
as a result of the tender offer  unrecognized compensation cost of million for the tendered unvested options expected to vest was accelerated and recorded as compensation expense for the year ended december  accordingly  the stock based compensation cost for the year ended december  is lower as compared to the comparable prior period in part due to the positive impact of the accelerated employee stock options in future periods 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  for the year ended december  over the comparable period in the decrease is primarily due to million in restructuring charges related to excess facilities from office closures and employee headcount reductions for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   and lower overall general and administrative expenses due to fewer employees and offices in as compared to debt refinancing costs during the years ended december  and  we incurred non recurring debt refinancing costs of million and million  respectively  from both fees related to our unsecured creditors legal and financial advisors who were engaged in connection with our debt refinancing negotiations and the closing of our debt refinancing transaction in june benefit provision for income taxes as a ric  we are subject to a nondeductible federal excise tax of if we do not distribute at least of our ordinary income  excluding net short term capital gains  in any calendar year and of our capital gains for each one year period ending october  including any undistributed income from the prior excise tax year 
for the calendar years ended december  and and the one year periods ending october  and  we distributed at least of our ordinary income and capital gains and did not accrue federal excise tax because we distributed sufficient dividends to eliminate any federal excise tax and had taxable ordinary losses and capital losses for the respective excise tax years 
however  we accrued an million tax benefit in the year ended december  related to excise tax for the calendar year ended december  and one year period ending october  as a result of a change in estimated taxable income of such prior year  which is included in our benefit provision for income taxes on the accompanying statements of operations 
our consolidated taxable operating subsidiary  american capital financial services  inc acfs  which was merged into american capital on june   was subject to federal  state and local income taxes

our investments have been historically exited through normal repayment or a change in control transaction such as a sale or recapitalization of the portfolio company 
for the year ended december   the million of net unrealized appreciation on our private finance portfolio investments was driven primarily by improved portfolio company performance  multiple expansion of comparable companies and narrowing investment spreads 
for the year ended december   the million of net unrealized depreciation on our private finance portfolio investments was driven primarily by degrading portfolio company performance  multiple contraction of comparable companies and widening investment spreads 
the operating results for our private finance portfolio companies began improving in the latter half of  which coincided with the end of the recent global economic recession in june from a trend perspective  we experienced a significant amount of net unrealized depreciation on our private finance portfolio investments during the first half of while recognizing modest net unrealized appreciation in the second half of european capital for the year ended december   we recognized unrealized appreciation of million on our investment in european capital comprised of million unrealized appreciation on our investment and million of unrealized appreciation from foreign currency translation of the cumulative unrealized depreciation of european capital 
as of december   our investment in european capital consisted of an equity investment with a cost basis and fair value of  million and million  respectively  and a debt investment with a fair value and cost basis of million 
european capital  a wholly owned portfolio company of american capital  is an investment fund that invests in and sponsors management and employee buyouts  invests in private equity buyouts and provides capital directly to private and mid sized public companies primarily in europe 
it primarily invests in senior and mezzanine debt and equity 
european capital s underlying portfolio investments are recorded at fair value determined in accordance with asc in determining the fair value of our investment in european capital  we concluded that our wholly owned equity investment should be less than the nav of european capital due to the risks associated with our ability to realize the full fair value of european capital s underlying assets for several reasons  including the yield and tenor of european capital s credit facilities  recent public comparables and an implied required market return on equity by market participants  which indicate fair values at a discount to nav 
the unrealized appreciation on our investment of million  excluding unrealized appreciation depreciation on foreign currency  during the year ended december  was due primarily to an increase in the nav of european capital and a reduction to the discount applied to nav 
the unrealized depreciation of million  excluding unrealized depreciation on foreign currency  during the year ended december  was due primarily to a decrease in the nav of european capital primarily as a result of a decline in the fair value of its portfolio investments during the year

the appreciation in the fair value of american capital  llc for the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in the projected cash flows as a result of a significant increase in the projected management fees for managing agnc due to significant growth in the agnc portfolio 
the depreciation in fair value of american capital  llc for the year ended december  was primarily due to a decline in its projected cash flows from reduced projected management fees and carried interest for managing european capital due in part to a decline in the fair value of european capital s investments since origination 
the funds managed by subsidiaries of american capital  llc are european capital  agnc  ace i  ace ii and acas clo structured products investments american capital has investments in structured products such as investment and non investment grade tranches of cmbs  clo and cdo securities with a cost basis of million and fair value of million as of december  during the years ended december  and  we recorded million of net unrealized appreciation and million of net unrealized depreciation on our structured products investments  respectively 
our cmbs portfolio experienced million and million of net unrealized depreciation during the years ended december  and  respectively  due primarily to lower projected future cash flows due to continued credit impairments in the overall commercial real estate markets 
our investments in clo and cdo portfolios of commercial loans experienced million and million of net unrealized appreciation during the years ended december  and  respectively  due primarily to a narrowing of investment spreads and higher broker quotes 
foreign currency translation we have investments in portfolio companies  including european capital  for which the investment is denominated in a foreign currency  primarily the euro 
we also have other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates therefore impact our financial condition and results of operations  as reported in us dollars 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded net unrealized depreciation of million and net unrealized appreciation of million  respectively 
this is primarily as a result of changes in the euro and us dollar exchange rates 
for foreign currency denominated investments recorded at fair value  such as european capital  the net unrealized appreciation or deprecation from foreign currency translation on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations represents the economic impact of translating the cost basis of the investment from a foreign currency  such as the euro  to the us dollar 
however  the economic impact of translating the cumulative unrealized appreciation or depreciation from a foreign currency to the us dollar is not recorded as net unrealized depreciation or appreciation from foreign currency translation but rather is included as net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of portfolio company investments on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
accordingly  for the years ended december  and  we recorded unrealized depreciation of million and unrealized appreciation of million for foreign currency translation  respectively  for the cost basis in our investment in european capital included in our total unrealized depreciation of million and unrealized appreciation of million for foreign currency translation for the years ended december  and  respectively  which was partially offset by unrealized appreciation of million and unrealized depreciation of million  respectively  for the foreign currency translation of our cumulative unrealized depreciation of our investment in european capital  which is included in our total net unrealized appreciation of portfolio investments 
derivative and option agreements and other during the year ended december   we recorded million of net unrealized depreciation from derivative agreements and other  primarily interest rate swaps 
the fair value of the net liability for our derivative agreements as of december  was million  which included a million net reduction related to the incorporation of an adjustment for nonperformance risk of us and our counterparties 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of net unrealized appreciation from derivative agreements and other  primarily due to net unrealized appreciation of million due to an increase in the forward interest rate yield curve  partially offset by unrealized depreciation of million associated with a reduction of our credit risk for non performance during the period 
for interest rate derivative agreements  we estimate the fair value based on the estimated net present value of the future cash flows using a forward interest rate yield curve in effect as of the end of the measurement period  adjusted for nonperformance risk  if any  including an evaluation of our credit risk and our counterparty s credit risk 
a negative fair value would represent an amount we would have to pay a third party and a positive fair value would represent an amount we would receive from a third party to assume our obligation under an interest rate derivative agreement 
the derivative agreements generally appreciate or depreciate primarily based on relative market interest rates and their remaining term to maturity as well as changes in our and our counterparty s credit risk

our weighted average debt and structured products investments decreased during as we chose to accumulate cash on our balance sheet from any realization of proceeds from the exit of portfolio investments during the year ended december   in anticipation of refinancing a portion of our unsecured debt obligations  and to delever our balance sheet by reinvesting a smaller portion of the proceeds into new investments than was the case in prior recent years 
the monthly weighted average effective interest rate on debt investments decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this was primarily due to i a basis point decrease in the average one month libor from the prior year  ii an increase in non accrual loans  iii partially offset by loans that were originated or modified during and the loans originated during this period were priced at generally higher spreads as compared to loans that have been repaid during these periods as market spreads had increased during these periods 
a portion of our debt investments  particularly our senior debt investments  accrue interest at libor plus a spread 
these loans either have no libor floor or may have a libor floor that is generally around 
as a result  as libor declines  our interest income generally will decline for our loans that are based on libor 
our average quarterly non accrual loans as a percentage of our total loans at cost increased in as compared to the prior year as the impact of the recent economic recession negatively impacted the performance of certain of our portfolio companies 
when a loan is placed on non accrual  we record reserves on uncollected pik interest income recorded in prior periods as a reduction of interest income in the current period 
for the year ended december   we recorded reserves on uncollected pik interest income recorded in prior periods of million  which had an approximately basis point impact on the weighted average effective interest rate for the year ended december  the monthly weighted average effective dividend yield on equity investments decreased basis points to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this was primarily due to i a lower accrual of dividends on our preferred stock investments of our private finance portfolio  ii discontinuation of dividends in from our investment in european capital and iii lower dividends from our investment in american capital  llc 
for the year ended december   we recorded reserves on uncollected accrued dividend income recorded in prior periods from private finance preferred stock investments of million  which were recorded as a reduction of dividend income in the current period 
the reserves on accrued dividend income were recorded because we no longer expect such amounts to be collected or realized

a valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining whether our deferred tax asset is realizable  we consider the forecasted future taxable income of acfs as well as any tax planning strategies 
considering the macroeconomic environment as of december   we concluded that it was more likely than not that we will not realize our deferred tax asset with future taxable income of acfs 
accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset in substantially most of our million tax provision for acfs in related to our recording of a valuation allowance 
as of december   we continued to conclude that it is more likely than not that we would not realize our deferred tax asset with future taxable income of acfs and have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
during the year ended december   we recorded a tax benefit of million related to acfs 
on november   the worker  homeownership  and business assistance act of was enacted

prior to the adoption of asc  we generally determined the fair value of our private finance portfolio investments by using the enterprise value waterfall enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology 
this valuation approach results in the determination of a fair value of our investments based on a change of control in an m a transaction or a recapitalization of the enterprise based on the value of the enterprise 
however  upon the adoption of asc  for investments in debt and redeemable preferred equity securities of portfolio companies for which we do not have the ability to initiate a sale of the portfolio company as of the measurement date and for which there is no active market  we are required under asc to use a hypothetical secondary market as our principal market 
we determine the fair value based on the assumptions that hypothetical market participants would use to value the investment in a current hypothetical sale using the market yield market yield valuation methodology 
european capital as of december   european capital was publicly traded on the london stock exchange under the ticker symbol ecas 
the fair value of european capital as of december  was based on the market quote as of december  plus a control premium because our board of directors determined that additional value above the market quote would be obtainable upon transfer of control 
the unrealized depreciation of million during the year ended december   excluding unrealized appreciation on foreign currency  was due primarily to a decrease in the closing market quote as of december  american capital  llc american capital  llc  a wholly owned portfolio company of american capital  is a holding company of fund managers 
during the year ended december   we recognized million of unrealized depreciation on our investment in american capital  llc 
the decline in value of american capital  llc for the year ended december  was primarily due to a decline in its projected cash flows from reduced projected management fees and carried interest for managing european capital due in part to a decline in the fair value of european capital s investments 
structured products investments american capital has investments in structured products such as investment and non investment grade tranches of cmbs  clo and cdo securities 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of net unrealized depreciation on our structured products investments 
our cmbs portfolio  which includes a commercial real estate cdo  experienced million of net unrealized depreciation during the year ended december  and our clo and cdo portfolios of commercial loans experienced million of net unrealized depreciation during the year ended december  we value our structured products investments using the market yield valuation methodology 
we estimate fair value based on third party broker quotes  sale transactions of identical or similar securities and our cash flow forecasts subject to our assumptions a market participant would use regarding the investments underlying collateral including  but not limited to  assumptions of default and recovery rates  reinvestment spreads and prepayment rates 
cash flow forecasts are discounted using a market participant s market yield assumptions that are derived from multiple sources including  but not limited to  third party broker quotes  industry research reports and transactions of securities and indices with similar structure and risk characteristics 
we weight the use of third party broker quotes  if any  in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer 
we considered that the current market for our structured products investments may be considered an inactive market and that the information used by the third party brokers to develop the quotes  if any  may generally not be based on actual transactions 
for the year ended december   the net unrealized depreciation of million and million in our cmbs and clo cdo portfolios  respectively  was driven primarily by a dramatic widening of the investments spreads from origination caused by the liquidity crisis in the market as well as credit performance  particularly in our cmbs portfolio 
the liquidity crisis drove investors expected returns higher on structured products investments 
foreign currency translation we have investments in portfolio companies  including european capital  for which the investment is denominated in a foreign currency  primarily the euro 
we also have other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates therefore impact our financial condition and results of operations  as reported in us dollars 
for the year ended december   we recorded net unrealized depreciation of million primarily as a result of the euro depreciating against the us dollar 
for the year ended december   we recorded unrealized depreciation of million for the cost basis in our investment in european capital included in our total unrealized depreciation of million for foreign currency translation for the year ended december   which was partially offset by unrealized appreciation of million for the foreign currency translation of our cumulative unrealized depreciation of our investment in european capital which is included in our total net unrealized depreciation of portfolio investments 
derivative and option agreements during the year ended december   we recorded million of net unrealized depreciation from interest rate derivative agreements  primarily interest rate swaps 
the decrease in the fair value of our interest rate derivative agreements during the year ended december  is primarily due to a decrease in the forward interest rate yield curve as a result of the decline in libor 
during the year ended december   we recorded million of unrealized depreciation from a put option agreement with european capital 
as of december   we were party to a put option agreement with european capital under which european capital can put some or all of certain investments to us at a predetermined put price of million approximately million as of december  
under the terms of the agreement  the put option may be exercised at any time commencing on january  and expiring on december  if  prior to january   the investments are sold to a third party for less than the predetermined put price  we would have been required to pay european capital an amount equal to the difference between the predetermined put price and the amount received on the sale 
in consideration for entering the put option  european capital paid us a premium of million million which is included on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability 
during the year ended december   we recorded net unrealized depreciation of million on the put option agreement primarily due to a decrease in fair value of the portfolio investments of european capital subject to the put option agreement 
on march   we entered into a termination agreement with european capital to terminate the put option agreement

return on shareholders equity the following table summarizes our returns on shareholders equity for the years ended december  and net operating income return on average equity at cost net realized loss earnings return on average equity at cost net loss return on average equity at fair value financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are our cash and cash equivalents and our portfolio investments 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of restricted cash and cash equivalents 
our restricted cash and cash equivalents consists primarily of collections of interest and principal payments on assets that are securitized 
in accordance with the terms of the related securitized debt agreements  based on current characteristics of the securitized loan portfolios  the restricted funds are generally used each quarter to pay interest and principal on the securitized debt and are not distributed to us or available for our general operations 
during the year ended december   we principally funded our operations from i cash receipts from interest  dividend and fee income from our investment portfolio and ii cash proceeds from the realization of portfolio investments through the repayments of loan investments and the sale of loan and equity investments 
for the fiscal year  we do not expect to have any dividend distribution requirements or required principal amortization requirements  except for any principal amortization of our secured notes within our asset securitizations 
we believe that we will continue to generate sufficient cash flow through the receipt of interest  dividend and fee payments from our investment portfolio  as well as cash proceeds from the realization of select portfolio investments  to allow us to continue to service our debt  pay our operating costs and expenses  distribute dividends to maintain our status as a ric  if any  fund capital to our current portfolio companies and originate new private finance investments and american capital one stop buyouts 
however  there is no certainty that we will generate sufficient liquidity to meet our liquidity needs 
operating and investing cash flow for the years ended december  and  cash provided by operations was million and million  respectively 
our cash flow from operations for the year ended december  was negatively impacted by a reduction in the recurring cash flow generated from our declining investment portfolio over the comparable period in partially offset by a reduction in operating expenses 
for the years ended december  and  we received net cash from investing activities totaling  million and million  respectively 
one of our other sources of liquidity is our investment portfolio 
our cash from investing activities include cash proceeds from the realization of portfolio investments totaling  million and  million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had portfolio investments totaling billion at fair value  including billion in debt investments  billion in equity investments and billion in structured products investments 
however  our investments are generally illiquid and no active primary or secondary market for the trading of these investments exists and our estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that may be ultimately realized 
we are generally repaid or exit our investments upon a change of control event of the portfolio company  such as a sale or recapitalization of the portfolio company 
due to the substantial decline in our investing in new portfolio investments and the significant volume of realization proceeds from the exit of investments  our investment portfolio at cost decreased from billion as of december  to billion as of december  more specifically  our private finance debt portfolio  which is the significant contributor to our operating income and our operating cash flows  decreased from billion at cost as of december  to billion at cost as of december  for the year ended december   approximately million of interest income collected during the year was generated from securitized assets  which is included in our cash flow from operations on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
however  because of defaulted loan collateral within our asset securitizations  all interest collections within the securitizations are currently required to be used to pay interest and principal on the outstanding notes in our securitizations with such principal payments included in our cash flow from financing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows

derivative agreements we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk and also to fulfill our obligations under the terms of our asset securitizations 
we also enter into foreign exchange swap agreements to manage foreign currency risk 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements are recorded at fair value with changes in value reflected in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments during the reporting period 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements is based on the estimated net present value of the future cash flows using the forward interest rate yield curve in effect at the end of the period  adjusted for the nonperformance risk of us and our counterparties 
we have interest rate swap agreements where we generally pay a fixed rate and receive a floating rate based on libor 
we also may enter into interest rate swaption agreements where  if exercised  we pay a floating rate based on libor and receive a fixed rate 
the fair value of our interest rate and foreign currency swap agreements are identified as separate items on our consolidated balance sheets and are described in the accompanying consolidated schedules of investments 
as of december   we had derivative agreements  primarily interest rate swap agreements  that had a net fair value liability of million 
certain of our interest rate swap agreements allow the counterparty to terminate the transactions under certain conditions 
as of december   none of the counterparties had the right to terminate the agreements 
equity capital as a bdc  we are generally not able to issue and sell our common stock at a price below our nav per share  exclusive of any distributing commission or discount  without either shareholder approval or providing all shareholders a right to participate in the issuance of stock below nav 
as of december   our nav per share was per share and our closing market price was per share 
on february   our shareholders approved a proposal to authorize us to sell shares of our common stock at prices below the nav per share in one or more offerings subject to certain limitations  including the prior approval of our board of directors 
the authorization was effective for a twelve month period expiring on february  and the number of shares that could be issued below nav per share was limited to  shares of common stock  which was of the number of shares outstanding as of the record date for the shareholder vote of the proposal  subject to adjustment for shares issued following the occurrence of events such as stock splits  stock dividends  distributions and recapitalizations 
in april  we completed a registered direct offering of  shares of our common stock to a group of institutional investors at a price of per share pursuant to this authorization 
upon completion of the offering  we received gross proceeds of approximately million 
as of the date of this filing  we do not have any authorization to issue shares of common stock below our nav per share 
future distribution requirements if we qualify as a ric and annually distribute to our shareholders in a timely manner at least of our taxable ordinary income  we will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our taxable ordinary income and long term capital gains we distribute to our shareholders 
as permitted by the code  a ric can designate dividends paid in the subsequent tax fiscal year as dividends of current year ordinary income and net long term gains if those dividends are both declared by the extended due date of the ric s federal income tax return and paid to shareholders by the last day of the subsequent tax fiscal year 
we have a tax fiscal year that ends on september we intend to continue to distribute sufficient dividends to eliminate our taxable income 
however  we may choose not to distribute sufficient dividends to eliminate all of our taxable income so long as we distribute at least of our taxable ordinary income in order to maintain our qualification as a ric 
to the extent we maintain our qualification as a ric but do not distribute all of our taxable income  we would be subject to federal income tax on such undistributed amounts 
for our tax fiscal year ended september   we expect to have a taxable ordinary loss and a net long term capital loss and therefore will not have a required distribution 
for our tax fiscal year ended september   we also expect to have a taxable ordinary loss and a net long term capital loss and therefore will not have a required distribution 
furthermore  as of december   we estimate that we have unused capital loss carryforwards of million to be applied against future capital gains  if any 
the estimate assumes that for each year we elect to defer net capital losses incurred from november through september as allowed under the code 
for any tax fiscal years ending on or before december   we can fulfill our distribution requirements by distributing up to of a declared dividend in the form of our common stock 
in order to utilize this option  we must allow each shareholder to elect to receive his or her entire distribution in either cash or our stock subject to a limitation on the aggregate amount of cash to be distributed to all shareholders  which must be at least of the aggregate declared distribution 
if too many shareholders elect to receive cash  each shareholder electing to receive cash will receive a pro rata amount of cash with the balance of the distribution paid in stock 
in no event will any shareholder electing to receive cash receive less than of his or her entire distribution in cash 
contractual obligations a summary of our contractual payment obligations as of december  are as follows in millions payment due by period total less than year years years after years unsecured public debt due secured private and non amortizing notes and loans due secured notes from asset securitizations interest payments on debt obligations operating leases total as of december   there was defaulted loan collateral in each of our asset securitization trusts and therefore all interest and principal collections are being applied sequentially to pay down principal on the notes 
payment periods are determined based on the restricted cash on hand as of december  and the amortization schedules of the underlying loan collateral 
for variable rate debt  future interest payments are based on the interest rate as of december  net of estimated sublease revenue 
off balance sheet arrangements we have non cancelable operating leases for office space and office equipment 
the leases expire over the next years and contain provisions for certain annual rental escalations 
however  certain of the office space subject to the non cancelable leases have been subleased to third party tenants and we may attempt to further sublease excess office space in the future 
as of december   we had commitments under loan and financing agreements to fund up to million to portfolio companies  with million of the commitments related to undrawn revolving credit facilities for european capital 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further discussion on european capital 
these commitments are primarily composed of working capital credit facilities  acquisition credit facilities and subscription agreements 
the commitments are generally subject to the borrowers meeting certain criteria such as compliance with covenants and availability under borrowing base thresholds 
the terms of the borrowings and financings subject to commitment are comparable to the terms of other loan and equity securities in our portfolio 
a summary of our loan and equity commitments as of december  is as follows in millions amount of commitment expiration by period total less than year years years after years loan and equity commitments portfolio credit quality we stop accruing interest on our investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible 
our valuation analysis serves as a critical piece of data in this determination 
a significant change in the portfolio company valuation assigned by us could have an effect on the amount of our loans on non accrual status 
as of december   loans on non accrual status for portfolio companies had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million 
as of december  and  current loans  past due accruing loans and loans on non accrual status were as follows dollars in millions december  december  current days past due days past due days past due greater than days past due total past due accruing loans at cost non accruing loans at cost total loans at cost non accruing loans at fair value total loans at fair value non accruing loans at cost as a percent of total loans at cost non accruing loans at fair value as a percent of total loans at fair value non accruing loans at fair value as a percent of non accruing loans at cost we believe that debt service collection is probable for our loans that are past due 
non accruing loans at cost decreased million from december  to december  primarily due to approximately million of loan write offs and exits  approximately million of loans removed from non accrual status due to improved portfolio company performance and million of non accruing loans recapitalized into equity during the period  partially offset by approximately million in new loans placed on non accrual status due to weaker portfolio company performance and an approximate million increase in cost basis of existing loans on non accrual status 
during  we recapitalized four portfolio companies by exchanging our loans for preferred or common equity securities that had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million 
during  we recapitalized european capital by exchanging a portion of our subordinated unsecured loans for ordinary shares that had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million 
during  we recapitalized eight additional portfolio companies by exchanging our loans for preferred or common equity securities that had a cost basis of million and a fair value of million 
credit statistics we monitor several key credit statistics that provide information about credit quality and portfolio performance 
these key statistics include debt to ebitda ratio the sum of all debt with equal or senior security rights to our debt investments divided by the total adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda  of the most recent twelve months or  when appropriate  the forecasted twelve months 
interest coverage ratio ebitda divided by the total scheduled cash interest payments required to have been made by the portfolio company during the most recent twelve month period  or when appropriate  the forecasted twelve months 
debt service coverage ratio ebitda divided by the total scheduled principal amortization and the total scheduled cash interest payments required to have been made during the most recent twelve month period  or when appropriate  the forecasted twelve months 
we generally require our portfolio companies to provide annual audited and monthly or quarterly unaudited financial statements 
using these financial statements  we calculate the statistics described above 
buyout and subordinated debt funds typically adjust ebitda due to the nature of change of control transactions 
such adjustments are intended to normalize and restate ebitda to reflect the pro forma results of a company in a change of control transaction 
for purposes of analyzing the financial performance of our portfolio companies  we make certain adjustments to ebitda to reflect the pro forma results of a company consistent with a change of control transaction in addition to adjusting ebitda for significant non recurring  unusual or infrequent items 
adjustments to ebitda may include anticipated cost savings resulting from a merger or restructuring  costs related to new product development  compensation to previous owners  non recurring revenues or expenses  and other acquisition or restructuring related items 
we track our portfolio investments on a static pool basis  including based on the statistics described above 
a static pool consists of the investments made during a given year 
the static pool classification is based on the year the initial investment was made 
subsequent add on investments are included in the static pool year of the original investment 
the pre static pool consists of the investments made from the time of our ipo through the year ended december  the following table contains a summary of portfolio statistics as of and for the period ended december  static pool portfolio statistics in millions  unaudited pre pre aggregate aggregate irr at fair value of all investments irr of exited investments irr at fair value of equity investments only irr of exited equity investments only original investments and commitments total exits and prepayments of original investments and commitments total interest  dividends and fees collected total net realized loss gain on investments current cost of investments current fair value of investments current fair value of investments as a of total investments at fair value net unrealized appreciation depreciation non accruing loans at cost non accruing loans at fair value equity interest at fair value debt to ebitda nm interest coverage nm debt service coverage nm average age of companies yrs yrs yrs yrs yrs yrs yrs yrs yrs yrs yrs diluted ownership percentage average sales average ebitda average ebitda margin total sales total ebitda of senior loans of loans with lien static pool classification is based on the year the initial investment was made

impact of inflation we believe that inflation can influence the value of our investments through the impact it may have on interest rates  the capital markets  the valuations of business enterprises and the relationship of the valuations to underlying earnings 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in accordance with gaap requires us to utilize accounting policies and make certain estimates and assumptions that could affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the related disclosures 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
the sec considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is both important to a company s financial condition and results of operations and it requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its applications 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies are the most affected by judgments  estimates and assumptions 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with our independent auditor and the audit and compliance committee of our board of directors 
although we believe that our judgments and estimates are appropriate and correct  actual results may differ from those estimates 
see item a 
risk factors for certain matters bearing risks on our future results of operations 
valuation of investments our investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the act and asc in accordance with the act  unrestricted publicly traded securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the closing market quote on the valuation date and restricted publicly traded securities and privately held securities are valued as determined in good faith by our board of directors 
for restricted securities of companies that are publicly traded  the value is based on the closing market quote on the valuation date less a discount for the restriction 
asc provides a framework for measuring the fair value of assets and liabilities and provides guidance regarding a fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the investments existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
asc defines fair value in terms of the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions 
the price used to measure the fair value is not adjusted for transaction costs while the cost basis of our investments may include initial transaction costs 
under asc  the fair value measurement also assumes that the transaction to sell an asset occurs in the principal market for the asset or  in the absence of a principal market  the most advantageous market for the asset 
the principal market is the market in which the reporting entity would sell or transfer the asset with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset 
in determining the principal market for an asset or liability under asc  it is assumed that the reporting entity has access to the market as of the measurement date 
if no market for the asset exists or if the reporting entity does not have access to the principal market  the reporting entity should use a hypothetical market 
the market in which we would sell our private finance investments is the m a market 
under asc  we have indentified the m a market as our principal market for portfolio companies only if we have the ability to initiate a sale of the portfolio company as of the measurement date 
we determine whether we have the ability to initiate a sale of a portfolio company based on our ability to control or gain control of the board of directors of the portfolio company as of the measurement date 
in evaluating if we can control or gain control of a portfolio company as of the measurement date  we include our equity securities and those securities held by entities managed by our wholly owned portfolio company  american capital  llc  on a fully diluted basis 
for investments in portfolio companies for which we do not have the ability to control or gain control as of the measurement date and for which there is no active market  our principal market under asc is a hypothetical secondary market 
the determination of the principal market used to estimate the fair value of each of our investments can have a material impact on our estimate of the fair value of our investments 
the levels of fair value inputs used to measure our investments are characterized in accordance with the fair value hierarchy established by asc where inputs for an asset or liability fall into more than one level in the fair value hierarchy  the investment is classified in its entirety based on the lowest level input that is significant to that investment s fair value measurement 
we use judgment and consider factors specific to the investment in determining the significance of an input to a fair value measurement 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy and investments that fall into each of the levels are described below level level inputs are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets that are accessible at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
we use level inputs for investments in publicly traded unrestricted securities 
such investments are valued at the closing price on the measurement date 
level level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable for the asset or liability  either directly or indirectly 
level level inputs are unobservable and cannot be corroborated by observable market data 
as of december   we use level inputs for measuring the fair value of all of our investments as follows for investments in portfolio companies for which we have identified the m a market as the principal market  we estimate the fair value based on the enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology 
for minority equity securities in which the principal market is a hypothetical secondary market  we also estimate the fair value using the enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology 
under the enterprise value waterfall valuation methodology  we estimate the enterprise fair value of the portfolio company and then waterfall the enterprise value over the portfolio company s securities in order of their preference relative to one another 
to estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio company  we prepare an analysis consisting of traditional valuation methodologies including market  income and cost approaches 
we weight some or all of the traditional valuation methodologies based on the individual circumstances of the portfolio company in order to conclude on our estimate of the enterprise value 
the traditional valuation methodologies consist of valuation estimates based on valuations of comparable public companies  recent sales of private and public comparable companies  discounting the forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company  estimating the liquidation or collateral value of the portfolio company s assets  third party valuations of the portfolio company  considering offers from third parties to buy the company  value indications of an ipo  estimating the value to potential strategic buyers and considering the value of recent investments in the equity securities of the portfolio company 
to determine the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze its historical and projected financial results  as well as other factors that may impact value  such as exposure to litigation  loss of significant customers or other contingencies 
this financial and other information is generally obtained from our portfolio companies  and may represent unaudited  projected or pro forma financial information 
in using a valuation methodology based on comparable public companies or sales of private or public comparable companies  we have to use significant judgment in the application of discounts or premiums to the prices of comparable companies for factors such as size  marketability and relative performance 
in using a valuation methodology based on the discounting of forecasted cash flows of the portfolio company  we have to use significant judgment in the development of an appropriate discount rate to be applied to the forecasted cash flows 
the assumptions incorporated in the valuation methodologies used to estimate the enterprise value consists primarily of unobservable level inputs  including management assumptions based on judgment 
for example  from time to time  we may have a portfolio company that has exposure to potential or actual litigation 
in evaluating the impact on the valuation for such items  we are required to estimate the amount that a market participant would consider in estimating fair value 
these estimates are highly subjective  based on management s assessment of the potential outcome s and the related impact on the fair value of such potential outcome s 
a change in these assumptions could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
for debt and redeemable preferred equity investments in portfolio companies for which we are required to identify a hypothetical secondary market as the principal market  we determine the fair value based on the assumptions that hypothetical market participants would use to value the investment in a current hypothetical sale using a market yield valuation methodology 
in applying the market yield valuation methodology  we estimate the fair value based on such factors as third party broker quotes and our own assumptions in the absence of market observable data including estimated remaining life  current market yield and interest rate spreads of similar loans and securities as of the measurement date 
the assumptions used to estimate the fair value in a hypothetical secondary market are considered primarily level inputs 
we weight the use of third party broker quotes  if any  in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer 
we estimate the remaining life based on market data of the average life of similar loans 
however  if we have information available to us that the loan is expected to be repaid in the near term  we would use an estimated remaining life based on the expected repayment date 
the average life used to estimate the fair value of our loans is generally shorter than the legal maturity of the loans as our loans have historically been prepaid prior to the maturity date 
the current interest rate spreads used to estimate the fair value of our loans is based on our experience of current interest rate spreads on similar loans 
if there is a significant deterioration of the credit quality of a loan  we may consider other factors that a hypothetical market participant would use to estimate fair value  including the proceeds that would be received in a liquidation analysis 
a change in the unobservable inputs and assumptions that we use to estimate the fair value of our loans could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
we value our investments in structured products using the market yield valuation methodology 
we estimate fair value based on such factors as third party broker quotes  sales of the same or similar securities and our cash flow forecasts subject to assumptions a market participant would use regarding the investments underlying collateral including  but not limited to  assumptions of default and recovery rates  reinvestment spreads and prepayment rates 
cash flow forecasts are discounted using a market participant s market yield assumptions that are derived from multiple sources including  but not limited to  third party broker quotes  industry research reports and transactions of securities and indices with similar structure and risk characteristics 
we weight the use of third party broker quotes  if any  in determining fair value based on our understanding of the level of actual transactions used by the broker to develop the quote and whether the quote was an indicative price or binding offer 
the cash flow forecasts and market yields used to discount the cash flows incorporate a significant amount of level inputs 
a change in our default and recovery rate assumptions in the cash flow forecasts or a change in the market yield assumptions could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
for an investment in an investment fund that does not have a readily determinable fair value  we measure the fair value of our investment predominately based on the nav per share of the investment fund if the nav of the investment fund is calculated in a manner consistent with the measurement principles of asc as of our measurement date  including measurement of all or substantially all of the underlying investments of the investee in accordance with asc however  in determining the fair value of our investment  we may make adjustments to the nav per share in certain circumstances  based on our analysis of any restrictions on redemption of our shares of our investment as of the measurement date  comparisons of price to nav per share of comparable publicly traded funds and trades or sales of comparable private and publicly traded funds  recent actual sales or redemptions of shares of the investment fund  expected future cash flows available to equity holders or other uncertainties surrounding our ability to realize the full nav of the investment fund 
as of december   we had an investment in european capital  a wholly owned investment fund that invests in and sponsors management and employee buyouts  invests in private equity buyouts and provides capital directly to private and mid sized public companies primarily in europe 
it primarily invests in senior and mezzanine debt and equity 
in determining the fair value of our investment in european capital  we concluded that our investment should be less than the nav of european capital due to the risks associated with our ability to realize the full fair value of european capital s underlying assets for several reasons  including the yield and tenor of european capital s credit facilities  an implied required market return on equity by market participants and recent public comparables  which indicate fair values at a discount to nav 
the use of a discount to nav of european capital requires significant judgment and a change in the assumptions used to develop the discount could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
we value derivative instruments based on fair value information from both the derivative counterparty  as adjusted for nonperformance risk considerations  and third party pricing services 
we corroborate the fair value by analyzing the estimated net present value of the future cash flows using relevant market forward interest rate yield curves in effect at the end of the period as adjusted for quantitative and qualitative nonperformance risk considerations 
a change in our determination of the nonperformance risk could have a material impact on the determination of fair value 
see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k for further information regarding the classification of our investment portfolio by levels  and as of december  interest and dividend income recognition interest income is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
oid is accreted into interest income using the effective interest method 
oid initially represents the value of detachable equity warrants obtained in conjunction with the origination or purchase of loans and loan origination fees that represent yield enhancement 
dividend income is recognized on the ex dividend date for common equity securities and on an accrual basis for preferred equity securities to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected or realized 
in determining the amount of dividend income to recognize  if any  from cash distributions on common equity securities  we will assess many factors including a portfolio company s cumulative undistributed income and operating cash flow 
cash distributions from common equity securities received in excess of such undistributed amounts are recorded first as a reduction of our investment and then as a realized gain on investment 
we stop accruing interest or dividends on our investments when it is determined that the interest or dividend is not collectible 
we assess the collectability of the interest and dividends based on many factors including the portfolio company s ability to service our loan based on current and projected cash flows as well as the current valuation of the portfolio company s current total enterprise value 
for investments with pik interest and cumulative dividends  we base income and dividend accruals on the valuation of the pik notes or securities received from the borrower or the redemption value of the security 
if the portfolio company valuation indicates a value of the pik notes or securities or redemption value that is not sufficient to cover the contractual interest or dividend  we will not accrue interest or dividend income on the notes or securities and will record an allowance for any accrued interest or dividend receivable as a reduction of interest or dividend income in the period we determine it is not collectible 
a change in the portfolio company valuation assigned by us could have an effect on our accrual of pik interest income on debt investments and dividend income of preferred stock investments 
also  a change in a portfolio company s operating performance and cash flows can impact a portfolio company s ability to service our debt and therefore could impact our interest recognition 
interest income on structured products is recognized on the effective interest method as required by fasb asc  investments other  beneficial interests in securitized financial assets asc 
under asc  at the time of purchase  we estimate the future expected cash flows and determine the effective interest rate based on these estimated cash flows and our cost basis 
subsequent to the purchase and on a quarterly basis  these estimated cash flows are updated and a revised yield is calculated prospectively based on the current amortized cost of the investment 
to the extent the current quarterly estimated cash flows decrease from the prior quarterly estimated cash flows  the revised yield is calculated prospectively based on the amortized cost basis of the investment calculated in accordance with fasb asc  investment debt and equity securities 
in estimating these cash flows  there are a number of assumptions that are subject to uncertainties and contingencies 
these include the amount and timing of principal payments including prepayments  repurchases  defaults and liquidations  the pass through or coupon rate  and interest rate fluctuations 
in addition  interest payment shortfalls due to delinquencies on the underlying loans and the timing of and magnitude of projected credit losses on the loans underlying the securities have to be estimated 
these uncertainties and contingencies are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may impact our estimates and interest income 
as a result  actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
stock based compensation we account for all share based payments to employees under asc we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using certain subjective assumptions  such as expected volatility  which is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility  and the expected term of the awards which is based on our historical experience of employee stock option exercises including forfeitures 
our valuation assumptions used in estimating the fair value of share based awards may change in future periods 
we recognize the fair value of awards over the vesting period or the requisite service period 
in addition  we calculate our pool of excess tax benefits available within additional paid in capital in accordance with the provisions of asc the following table reflects the weighted average fair value per option granted during the years ended december   and  as well as the weighted average assumptions used in determining those fair values using the black scholes pricing model 
options granted in millions fair value on grant date expected dividend yield expected volatility estimated annual forfeiture rate risk free interest rate expected life years we determine our expected volatility used in the black scholes option pricing model based on a combination of our historical volatility during the expected term of the option and our implied volatility based on the market prices of traded options of our stock 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the equity based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
derivative financial instruments we maintain an interest rate risk management strategy under which we use derivative financial instruments to primarily manage the adverse impact of interest rates changes on our cash flows by locking in the spread between our asset yield and the cost of our borrowings  and to fulfill our obligation under the terms of our asset securitizations 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments during the reporting period 
the fair value of interest rate derivative agreements is based on the estimated net present value of the future cash flows using the forward interest rate yield curve in effect at the end of the period  adjusted for non performance risk based on our credit risk and our counterparty s credit risk 
we consider the impact of any collateral requirements  credit enhancements or netting arrangements in evaluating credit risk 
our derivatives are considered economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting under asc we record the accrual of the periodic interest settlements of interest rate derivatives in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments and subsequently record the cash payments as a realized gain or loss on investments on the interest settlement date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we consider our principal market risks to be the fluctuations of interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and the valuations of our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk because we fund a portion of our investments with borrowings  our net increase in net assets from operations is affected by the spread between the rate at which we invest and the rate at which we borrow 
we attempt to match fund our liabilities and assets by financing floating rate assets with floating rate liabilities and fixed rate assets with fixed rate liabilities or equity 
we enter into interest rate basis swap agreements to match the interest rate basis of our assets and liabilities  thereby locking in the spread between our asset yield and the cost of our borrowings  and to fulfill our obligations under the terms of our asset securitizations 
however  our derivatives are considered economic hedges that do not qualify for hedge accounting under fasb asc topic as of december   after adjusting for the use of interest rate swaps   or billion of principal  of our debt investments provided fixed rate returns and  or billion of principal  provided floating rate returns tied primarily to libor 
excluding debt investments on non accrual status   or billion of principal  of our accruing debt investments provided fixed rate returns and  or billion of principal  provided floating rate returns tied primarily to libor 
as of december   we had total borrowings outstanding of billion that had a variable rate of interest based on libor  the prime rate or the federal funds rate 
under our interest rate swap agreements  we generally pay a fixed rate and receive a floating interest rate based on libor 
we also have interest rate swaption agreements where  if exercised  we receive a fixed rate and pay a floating rate based on libor 
we may enter into interest rate cap agreements that would entitle us to receive an amount  if any  by which our interest payments on our variable rate debt exceeds specified interest rates 
for those investments contributed to the term securitizations  the interest swap agreements enable us to lock in the spread between the asset yield on the investments and the cost of the borrowings under the term securitizations 
one month libor increased from as of december  to as of december  while the three month libor increased from as of december  to as of december  a summary of our interest rate swap and swaption agreements are included in our schedule of investments in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
foreign currency risks we have a limited amount of investments in portfolio companies  including european capital  for which the investment is denominated in a foreign currency  primarily the euro 
we also have other assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
fluctuations in exchange rates therefore impact our financial condition and results of operations  as reported in us dollars 
during the year ended december   the foreign currency translation adjustment recorded in our consolidated statements of operations was net unrealized depreciation of million  primarily as a result of the euro depreciating against the us dollar 
portfolio valuation our investments are carried at fair value in accordance with the act and asc for a description of our accounting policy for valuation of investments  see note to our consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
due to the uncertainty inherent in the valuation process  such estimates of fair value may differ significantly from the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed  and the differences could be material 
additionally  changes in the market environment and other events that may occur over the life of the investments may cause the gains or losses ultimately realized on these investments to be different than the valuations currently assigned 
as of december   the fair value of of our investments were estimated using level inputs determined in good faith by our board of directors because the investments were not publicly traded on an active market
