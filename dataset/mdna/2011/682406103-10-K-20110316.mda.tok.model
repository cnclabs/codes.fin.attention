item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we were organized in in maryland 
we are self administered and self managed real estate investment trust 
we acquire  own and manage a geographically diversified portfolio of retail including furniture and office supply stores  industrial  office  flex  health and fitness and other properties  a substantial portion of which are under long term net leases 
as of december   we owned properties  two of which are vacant  and one of which is a tenancy in common interest 
our joint ventures owned a total of four properties 
the properties are located in states 
we face a variety of risks and challenges in our business 
as more fully described under item a risk factors  we  among other things  face the possibility we will not be able to lease our properties on terms favorable to us or at all and that our tenants may not be able to pay their rental and other obligations owing under their leases 
in particular  during the recent national economic recession  consumer confidence and retail spending declined  which negatively impacted certain of our retail tenants 
as a result  from through february  four of our retail tenants sought bankruptcy protection and several of our retail tenants requested rent relief  lease amendments  and other financial concessions from us due to the deterioration of their financial condition 
we seek to manage the risk of our real property portfolio by diversifying among types of properties and industries ie    and of our contractual rental income is derived from retail  industrial  office  and other properties  respectively  tenant identity no tenant accounts for more than of our contractual rental income  geography contractual rental income exceeds from properties in only two states  and lease expiration dates through  there are only two years in which the percentage of our contractual rental income represented by expiring leases exceeds of our contractual rental income and approximately of our contractual rental income is represented by leases expiring in and thereafter 
we monitor the risk of tenant non payments through a variety of approaches tailored to the applicable situation 
generally  based on our assessment of the credit risk posed by our tenants  we monitor a tenant financial condition through one or more of the following actions reviewing tenant financial statements  obtaining other tenant related financial information  regular contact with tenant representatives  tenant credit checks and regular management reviews of our tenants 
in acquiring properties  we balance an evaluation of the terms of the leases and the credit of the existing tenants with a fundamental analysis of the real estate to be acquired  which analysis takes into account  among other things  the estimated value of the property  local demographics and the ability to re rent or dispose of the property on favorable terms upon lease expiration or early termination 
during  economic conditions began to improve and credit became more available 
we purchased properties for an aggregate of million including the assumption of an aggregate of million mortgage debt 
although some tenants continued to face financial challenges during and through early and requested rent relief or sought bankruptcy court protection eg  two tenants that accounted for  or of rental income sought bankruptcy court protection  our occupancy rate at december  was if our two tenants in bankruptcy vacate their respective properties  our occupancy rate would be 
additionally  although banks have remained cautious with their lending criteria  we were able to finance an aggregate of million of mortgage debt 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december  and the following table sets forth a comparison of revenues for and year ended december  dollars in thousands difference change revenues rental income  net lease termination fee   n a total revenues rental revenues rental income 
a significant component of the increase is the million of rental revenue generated from the properties we acquired in  of which million is attributable to our february acquisition of a community shopping center 
these properties account for million or of contractual rental income 
partially offsetting the increase was an approximately  decrease in rental income representing the december rent of  that was not accrued and the  net write off of the entire balance of unbilled rent receivable and lease intangibles resulting from robb stucky bankruptcy filing 
robb stucky accounted for  or of our rental income  no assurance can be given that if and when robb stucky vacates the property  that we will re lease such property on equivalent terms or at all 
approximately  of the increase represents real estate tax and expense reimbursements from tenants from three properties we acquired in lease termination fee 
in  we received a million lease termination payment from a retail tenant which was offset by the  write off of the entire balance of the unbilled rent receivable and intangible lease asset related to this property 
there was no comparable fee income in operating expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of operating expenses for and year ended december  dollars in thousands difference change operating expenses depreciation and amortization general and administrative real estate acquisition costs real estate expenses leasehold rent total operating expenses operating income depreciation and amortization 
the increase is substantially due to depreciation and amortization on the properties we acquired in because the million expense only reflects our ownership of these properties for a portion of  we anticipate that this expense will increase and that the 
table of contents expense attributable to these properties  which was  in will  in  be approximately  general and administrative expense 
the increase is attributable principally to the following items i a  increase in the annual fee payable pursuant to the compensation and services agreement  and ii the inclusion of  of professional fees incurred in connection with an equity financing that was not pursued 
the net balance of the increase is attributable to increases in payroll  amortization expense relating to our restricted stock awards and the award of pay for performance restricted stock units  investor relations activities  and directors fees  none of which was material on an individual basis 
partially offsetting this increase was an  decrease from in expenses relating to litigation involving our former president activities 
real estate acquisition costs 
these expenses increased because of our acquisition of properties 
we did not acquire any properties in but incurred  of such expense in in connection with an acquisition completed in february real estate expenses 
approximately  of the increase results from real estate taxes and expenses  and  respectively from three properties we acquired in the tenants are contractually obligated to reimburse us  and have reimbursed us  for a substantial portion of these expenses 
approximately  of the increase is attributable to real estate taxes  of which  is attributable to the property tenanted by robb stucky 
there were also increases in repairs  maintenance and other operating expenses at several properties 
other income and expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of other income and expenses for and year ended december  dollars in thousands difference change other income and expenses equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures gain on disposition of real estate held by unconsolidated joint venture n a other income  including realized gain on sale of available for sale securities and interest income interest expense amortization of deferred financing costs income from settlement with former president equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
approximately  of the decrease results primarily from a sale by a joint venture of its only property on april  at the same time the related lease expired and approximately  relates to a decrease in rental income of another joint venture 
interest expense 
the increase is due to increased interest expense on our outstanding mortgages and credit line 
net mortgage interest expense increased by approximately  or 
mortgage interest expense increased by approximately million due to the assumption  in connection with acquisitions  of mortgage debt in the aggregate amount of million and million in connection with the financing of certain properties  which increase was partially offset by the payoff or paydown of mortgage loans aggregating million  as well as regular monthly principal amortization of other mortgages 
the weighted average interest rate of the mortgages that were paid off and paid down in 
table of contents was approximately and the weighted average interest rate of the mortgages we assumed and on the properties we financed in is approximately 
in addition  interest expense relating to our revolving line of credit increased by  due primarily to the increase  effective april   in the interest rate charged thereunder 
amortization of deferred financing costs 
the decrease was primarily due to accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs of  relating to a mortgage loan that was refinanced during this was offset in part by the amortization of deferred financing costs that were incurred in connection with new financings 
income from settlement with former president 
in november  civil litigations commenced by us as plaintiff  against our former president and chief executive officer  arising out of his inappropriate financial dealings  were settled  and we received  in cash and  shares of our common stock valued at  based on the november  closing price 
we were also assigned an interest in a real estate consulting venture  the value of which was fully reserved against 
discontinued operations the following table sets forth a comparison of discontinued operations for and year ended december  dollars in thousands difference change discontinued operations income from operations impairment charges gain on troubled mortgage restructuring  as a result of conveyance to mortgagee net gain on sales income from discontinued operations discontinued operations for includes the results of operations and the gain on sale of two properties sold in and for includes the results of operations of ten properties  five of which were conveyed by us to the mortgagee in july  three of which were sold in and two of which were sold in included in income from discontinued operations for is a  lease termination payment from a retail tenant that had been paying its rent on a current basis  but vacated the property in in march  we sold this property and recorded an impairment charge of  to recognize the loss on the sale 
also included in income from discontinued operations for is an  gain recognized in connection with the conveyance of five of our properties to the mortgagee by deeds in lieu of foreclosure 
these properties had formerly been leased to circuit city stores inc which filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws and rejected the leases for these five properties 

table of contents comparison of years ended december  and december  rental revenues the following table sets forth a comparison of revenues for and year ended december  dollars in thousands difference change revenues rental income  net lease termination fee   n a total revenues rental income 
the increase in rental revenues is primarily due to rental revenues of million earned during on twelve properties acquired by us during the increase in rental income was offset by a decrease in rent payments from two tenants adversely affected by the recession and by a lease termination in june  for which we received the lease termination fee referred to below 
lease termination fee 
the lease termination fee income received in resulted from a  lease termination payment from a retail tenant that had been paying its rent on a current basis  but had vacated the property in march  offset by the write off of the entire balance of the unbilled rent receivable and intangible lease asset related to this property  aggregating  there was no comparable fee income in this property was released effective november  operating expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of operating expenses for and year ended december  dollars in thousands difference change operating expenses depreciation and amortization general and administrative real estate acquisition costs n a real estate expenses leasehold rent total operating expenses operating income depreciation and amortization expense 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily due to increases of  on twelve properties acquired during  as well as from an increase in depreciation expense of building improvements 
real estate expenses 
real estate expenses increased primarily from real estate taxes and utilities related to a vacant property 
in addition  includes real estate taxes for another property which became subject to a lease with a new tenant under which we are responsible for the real estate taxes  and an increase in repairs  maintenance and other operating expenses at several properties 

table of contents other income and expenses the following table sets forth a comparison of other income and expenses for and year ended december  dollars in thousands difference change other income and expenses equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures gain on disposition of real estate held by unconsolidated joint venture interest and other income interest expense amortization of deferred financing costs income from settlement with former president n a gain on sale of excess unimproved land gain on disposition of real estate of unconsolidated joint venture 
in  we recognized a net gain of  on the sale by a joint venture of a vacant property 
there was no comparable gain in interest and other income 
the decrease in interest and other income resulted primarily because we had less cash available for investment as we applied available cash to purchase nine properties in september in addition  interest rates earned on short term cash equivalents declined significantly 
offsetting the decrease in interest income was  of consulting fee income and  received for granting an easement at one of our properties  both recorded in interest expense 
interest expense decreased as a result of the payoff in full of two mortgage loans during  as well as from the monthly principal amortization of other mortgages 
these decreases were offset by interest expense on fixed rate mortgages placed on three properties between september and march in addition  at the end of september  we borrowed million under our line of credit which was applied to the purchase of eight properties  of which million was repaid in november with a portion of the proceeds from a mortgage financing of one of our properties 
accordingly  interest expense relating to our line of credit increased by  during amortization of deferred financing costs 
amortization of deferred financing costs increased primarily from accelerated amortization of deferred financing costs of  relating to a mortgage loan that was refinanced during and from  relating to a mortgage loan that was repaid in full during gain on sale of excess unimproved land 
during  we sold five acres of excess unimproved land that we acquired as part of the purchase of a flex building in and recognized a gain of million 
there was no such gain in 
table of contents discontinued operations the following table sets forth a comparison of discontinued operations for and year ended december  dollars in thousands difference change discontinued operations income from operations impairment charges gain on troubled mortgage restructuring  as a result of conveyance to mortgagee n a net gain on sales   n a income loss from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations includes the operations of ten of our properties  five of which were conveyed to the mortgagee in  three of which were sold during and two of which were sold in in july  non recourse mortgages  secured and cross collateralized by five of our properties that had formerly been leased to circuit city stores inc  had an outstanding balance of  circuit city stores  inc filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws in november and rejected leases for two of our properties in december and rejected leases for the remaining three properties in march no payments were made on these mortgages from december  and a letter of default was received on march  in july  these properties were conveyed to the mortgagee by deeds in lieu of foreclosure and we and our five wholly owned subsidiaries which owned the circuit city properties were released from all obligations  including principal  interest and real estate taxes due 
we had accrued mortgage interest expense totaling  for the period december through july  and accrued real estate tax expense totaling  on these five properties 
the carrying value of the portfolio of the properties transferred of  net of the  of impairment charges taken at december   approximated their fair value at the time of transfer 
during the year ended december   we recognized an  gain based on the excess of the carrying amount of the payables mortgage  real estate taxes and mortgage interest over the fair value of the portfolio of properties transferred 
the gain also reflects the write off of deferred costs and escrows relating to these mortgages totaling in addition to the million impairment charge taken during against the circuit city properties discussed above  an impairment charge of  was taken against another property in  where a retail tenant that had been paying its rent on a current basis had vacated the property in in march  we sold this property and recorded an impairment charge of  to recognize the loss 
in october  in unrelated transactions  we sold two properties and recognized gains for accounting purposes totaling  no impairment charges had been taken with respect to these properties 
there were no comparable gains in 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital include cash flow from our operations  cash and cash equivalents  available for sale securities  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  refinancing existing mortgage loans and obtaining mortgage loans secured by our unencumbered properties 
our available liquidity at december  was approximately million  including million of cash and cash equivalents   of marketable securities and million available under our revolving line of credit 
our available liquidity as of march  was approximately million  including million of cash and cash equivalents   in available for sale securities and million available under our revolving line of credit 
liquidity increased after december  by approximately million as a result of the amendment to our credit line in january which increased the amount we are able to borrow by million and the public offering we completed in february in which we issued million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of approximately million 
liquidity and financing we expect to meet substantially all of our operating cash requirements including dividend payments from cash flow from operations 
to the extent that cash flow from operations is not adequate to cover all of our operating needs  we will be required to use our available cash and cash equivalents  sell our marketable securities or draw on our credit line to the extent permitted to satisfy operating requirements 
mortgage debt in aggregate principal amount of million is payable from march through december  ie  million in and million in 
we generally intend to refinance or extend the mortgage loans which mature in and though no assurance can be given in this regard  we believe that we will be able to refinance or extend the repayment obligation of such debt because  among other things  approximately million of such mortgage debt secures properties with long term leases ie  expiring in and and approximately million represents debt amortization payments  a portion of which will be paid from operating cash flow 
we intend to repay the amount not refinanced or extended from our existing cash position  including our marketable securities or our credit line to the extent permitted and available 
we continually seek to refinance existing mortgage loans on terms we deem acceptable  in order to generate additional liquidity 
additionally  in the normal course of our business  we sell properties when we determine that it is in our best interests  which also generates additional liquidity 
further  since each of our encumbered properties is subject to a non recourse mortgage with standard carve outs  if our in house evaluation of the market value of such property is substantially less than the principal balance outstanding on the mortgage loan  we may determine to convey such property to the mortgagee in order to terminate our mortgage obligations  including payment of interest  principal and real estate taxes  with respect to such property 
typically  we utilize funds from a credit facility to acquire a property and  thereafter secure long term  fixed rate mortgage debt on such property 
we apply the proceeds from the mortgage loan to repay borrowings under the credit facility  thus providing us with the ability to re borrow under the credit facility for the acquisition of additional properties 
as a result  in order to grow our business  it is important to have a credit facility in place in order for us to pursue an active acquisition program 
in addition  from through a portion of  borrowers were limited in their ability to obtain mortgage financing 
while we were able to obtain mortgage financing in  if we are limited in doing so in the future  it will adversely affect our ability to acquire additional properties and finance or refinance existing properties 

table of contents credit facility our revolving credit facility is provided pursuant to the second amended and restated loan agreement  dated as of march   with vnb new york corp  bank leumi usa  israel discount bank of new york and manufacturers and traders trust company  as amended as of january  the credit facility is available to us for the acquisition of commercial real estate  repayment of mortgage debt  and for any other purpose  provided  if used for a purpose other than a property acquisition or mortgage repayment  the amount borrowed for such other purpose will not exceed the lesser of million and of the permitted borrowing base 
the facility matures on march  and bears interest at the greater of i day libor plus and ii 
borrowings under the facility may not exceed million and there is an unused facility fee of per annum on the difference between the outstanding loan balance and million 
we are required to maintain at least million average outstanding collected deposit balances 
the facility is guaranteed by specified subsidiaries of our company and secured by stock or membership interests in certain subsidiaries 
net proceeds received from the sale or refinancing of properties are required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the facility if proceeds from the facility were used to purchase or refinance the property 
the terms of our revolving credit facility include certain restrictions and covenants which may limit  among other things  the incurrence of liens  and which require compliance with financial ratios relating to  among other things  the minimum amount of tangible net worth  the minimum amount of debt service coverage  the minimum amount of fixed charge coverage  the maximum amount of debt to value  the minimum level of net income  certain investment limitations and the minimum value of unencumbered properties and the number of such properties 
as of december   we were in compliance with applicable covenants 
contractual obligations the following sets forth our contractual obligations as of december   which includes interest and amortization payments and balances due at maturity under outstanding mortgages secured by our properties for the periods indicated 
it also includes the amount due at maturity under our credit facility 
payment due by period dollars in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years mortgages payable interest and amortization mortgages payable balances due at maturity credit facility purchase obligations total represents the amount outstanding as of december  we may borrow up to  under such facility 
includes  payable annually pursuant to the compensation and services agreement at the rate in effect at december  and assuming such agreement continues for only five years  amounts payable to lease office space from a related party and amounts payable pursuant to a ground lease 
as of december   we had million of mortgage debt outstanding excluding mortgage indebtedness of our unconsolidated joint ventures  all of which is non recourse subject to standard carve outs 
in february  we repaid million of mortgage debt 
we expect that 
table of contents mortgage interest and amortization payments excluding repayments of principal at maturity of approximately million due through will be paid primarily from cash generated from our operations 
we anticipate that after giving effect to the million paydown of our line of credit and the repayment of million of mortgage debt  both effected following our february public offering  debt obligations due through of approximately million  including million currently outstanding under our credit facility  will be paid primarily from cash and cash equivalents and mortgage financings and refinancings 
if we are unsuccessful in refinancing our existing indebtedness or financing our unencumbered properties  our cash flow  funds available under our credit facility and available cash  if any  may not be sufficient to repay all debt obligations when payments become due  and we may need to issue additional equity  obtain long or short term debt  or dispose of properties on unfavorable terms 
cash distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently at least of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders pursuant to internal revenue procedures 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal  state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income taxes on our undistributed taxable income ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder and are subject to federal excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 
it is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code no less than  and  if possible  of our annual taxable income  including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it will continue to be our policy to make sufficient distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our reit status under the internal revenue code 
in  our board determined that  in view of the economic environment  we should conserve our capital 
as a result  all of our dividends declared in consisted of stock and cash  pursuant to revenue procedures issued by the internal revenue service 
in  as a result of the improving economic climate  all of the dividends we declared an aggregate of per share were paid in cash 
our board of directors reviews the dividend policy at each regularly scheduled quarterly board meeting to determine if any changes to our dividend should be made and whether the distribution should consist of all cash or a combination of cash and stock 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  provided in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these critical accounting policies include the following  discussed below 

table of contents purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate the fair value of real estate acquired is allocated to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land and building  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and other value of in place leases based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land and building is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building based on management determination of relative fair values of these assets 
we assess fair value of the lease intangibles based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount rates and available market information 
the fair values associated with below market rental renewal options are determined based on our experience and the relevant facts and circumstances that existed at the time of the acquisitions 
the portion of the values of the leases associated with below market renewal options that are likely to be exercised are amortized to rental income over the respective renewal periods 
the allocation made by management may have a positive or negative effect on net income and may have an effect on the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
revenues our revenues  which are substantially derived from rental income  include rental income that our tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight line basis over the term of each lease 
it is our policy not to record straight line rent beyond the expected useful life of a building 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables which we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the term of the lease 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  that the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review unbilled rent receivables on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant payment history and the financial condition of the tenant 
in the event that the collectability of an unbilled rent receivable is in doubt  we are required to take a reserve against the receivable or a direct write off of the receivable  which has an adverse affect on net income for the year in which the reserve or direct write off is taken  and will decrease total assets and stockholders equity 
carrying value of real estate portfolio we review our real estate portfolio on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there are any indicators of impairment to the carrying value of any of our real estate assets  including deferred costs and intangibles  in order to determine if there is any need for an impairment charge 
in reviewing the portfolio  we examine the type of asset  the current financial statements or other available financial information of the tenant  the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located  the economic situation in the industry in which the tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by the tenant under its lease  as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with the tenant  including property inspection reports 
for each real estate asset owned for which indicators of impairment exist  if the undiscounted cash flow analysis yields an amount which is less than the asset carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the estimated fair value is less than the asset carrying amount 
the estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model of the expected future cash flows through the useful life of the property 
real estate assets that are expected to be disposed of are valued at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell on an individual asset basis 
we generally do not obtain any independent appraisals in determining value but rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any impairment charge taken with respect to any part of our real estate portfolio will reduce our net income and reduce assets and stockholders equity to the extent of the amount of any impairment charge  but it will not affect our cash flow or our distributions until such time as we dispose of the property 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is the effect of changes in interest rates on the interest cost of draws on our revolving variable rate credit facility and the effect of changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
at december   we had two interest rate swap agreements outstanding that were entered into march and november the fair market value of the interest rate swaps is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december   if there had been a increase in forward interest rates  the fair market value of the interest rate swaps and net unrealized gain on derivative instruments would have increased by approximately  if there were a decrease in forward interest rates  the fair market value of the interest rate swaps and net unrealized gain on derivative instruments would have decreased by approximately  these changes would not have any impact on our net income or cash 
from time to time  we utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes not for speculation 
we do not enter into interest rate swaps for trading purposes 
our mortgage debt excluding our mortgage subject to the interest swap agreements  bears interest at fixed rates and accordingly  the effect of changes in interest rates would not impact the amount of interest expense that we incur under these mortgages 
our credit facility is a revolving variable rate facility which is sensitive to interest rates 
under current market conditions  we do not believe that our risk of material potential losses in future earnings  fair values and or cash flows from near term changes in market rates that we consider reasonably possible is material 
we assessed the market risk for our revolving credit facility and believe that there is no foreseeable market risk because interest is charged at the greater of i day libor plus and ii per annum 
at december   day libor plus was approximately  therefore  a increase or decrease would not have any impact on our interest expense 
the fair market value of our long term debt is estimated based on discounting future cash flows at interest rates that our management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration 
the following table sets forth our debt obligations by scheduled principal cash flow payments and maturity date  weighted average interest rates and estimated fair market value at december  for the year ended december  thereafter total fair market value dollars in thousands fixed rate long term debt note weighted average interest rate note variable rate long term debt note note does not give effect to the repayment in february of million of mortgage debt bearing a weighted average interest rate of
