critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the use of estimates and assumptions that involve the exercise of judgment that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  and for which the impact of changes in estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial statements 
the following discussion 
table of contents addresses the accounting policies that we believe are critical based on the nature of our operations 
we believe that all of the decisions and assessments upon which our financial statements are based were reasonable at the time made  based upon information available to us at that time 
this discussion is intended to supplement the description of our significant accounting policies in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures since we commenced operations on september   most of our investment activities have been structured as joint ventures with one or more of the co investment funds under an investment allocation agreement see business co investment funds 
the joint ventures are generally capitalized through equity contributions from the members  although in certain cases they have leveraged their investments through talf financing or other lending arrangements 
in some cases these joint ventures are considered to be variable interest entities vies 
generally  a vie is an entity with one or more of the following characteristics a the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  b as a group  the holders of the equity investment at risk lack i the power  through voting rights or similar rights  to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its financial performance  ii the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity  or iii the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity  or c the equity investors have voting rights that are not proportional to their economic interests and substantially all of the entity s activities either involve  or are conducted on behalf of  an investor including its related parties that has disproportionately few voting rights 
gaap requires a vie to be consolidated in the financial statements of the entity that is determined to be the primary beneficiary of the vie 
the primary beneficiary generally is the entity that has both the following characteristics i the power to direct the activities of the vie that most significantly impact its economic performance  and ii the obligation to absorb expected losses of  or the right to receive benefits from  the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
in certain circumstances  we hold of the voting rights to elect the board of directors of the joint venture  but own varying economic interests  which currently range from to 
in other cases  our voting rights are proportional to our economic interests  however the joint ventures are subject to management or other contracts that create vies 
we have analyzed each of the joint ventures and determined that either they are not vies and we do not have a controlling financial interest  or they are vies but we are not the primary beneficiary 
in determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a vie  we consider qualitative and quantitative factors  including  but not limited to the amount and characteristics of our investment  the obligation or likelihood that we or other investors will be required to provide financial support  our and the other investors ability to control or significantly influence key decisions for the vie  and the similarity and significance of the vie s business activities to our and the other investors business activities 
significant judgments related to these determinations include estimates about the current and future fair values and performance of assets held by the vies and general market conditions 
our exposure with respect to the joint ventures is limited to amounts invested or committed to the joint ventures at inception  and neither we nor the other investors are required to provide financial or other support in excess of our capital commitments 
when we are not required to consolidate the joint ventures  we account for our investments in joint ventures using the equity method 
we initially record investments in unconsolidated joint ventures at cost and adjust for our proportionate share of net earnings or losses  cash contributions made and distributions received  and other adjustments  as appropriate 
distributions of operating profit from joint ventures are reported as part of operating cash flows on our statement of cash flows 
distributions related to a capital transaction  such as a refinancing transaction or sale  are reported as investing activities on our statement of cash flows 
the joint ventures critical accounting policies are similar to ours and their financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
we perform a quarterly evaluation of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures to determine whether the fair value of our interest in each joint venture is less than the carrying value  and  if such loss in value is other than temporary  we write down our investment to fair value 

table of contents loans receivable and interest income recognition our purchased and originated loans receivable are classified as held for investment based upon our intent and ability to hold them for the foreseeable future 
purchased loans are recorded at amortized cost  or the outstanding unpaid principal balance  net of unamortized purchase discount 
costs incurred in connection with purchased loans are expensed as incurred 
all of the purchased loans currently in our portfolio  whether held directly or indirectly though our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  were acquired at an amount that is less than the outstanding unpaid principal balance 
originated loans are recorded at amortized cost  or the outstanding unpaid principal balance  net of unamortized origination fees charged to the borrower and direct origination costs incurred 
interest income is recognized based on the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans 
purchase discount or net origination fees and origination costs are recognized as additional interest income over the remaining loan term as a yield adjustment using the interest method 
the objective of the interest method is to arrive at periodic interest income that yields a level rate of return over the loan term 
we also purchase loans at a discount to face value where  at the acquisition date  we expect to collect less than the contractual amounts due under the terms of the loan based  at least in part  on our assessment of the credit quality of the borrower 
loans acquired with evidence of deteriorated credit quality are recorded at our initial investment in the loan and subsequently accreted to our estimate of cash flows at acquisition expected to be collected 
acquired portfolios of credit distressed loans may be aggregated into loan pools based upon common risk characteristics  including loan performance  collateral type  and or geographic location of the collateral 
once a loan pool is identified  we use a composite interest rate and estimate of cash flows expected to be collected to recognize accretion 
costs and fees directly associated with acquiring loans with evidence of deteriorated credit quality are expensed as incurred 
non performing loans or loan pools acquired with evidence of deteriorated credit quality are placed upon nonaccrual status until we can reasonably estimate the amount and timing of cash flows expected to be collected 
we place performing loans or loan pools on nonaccrual status when any portion of principal or interest is more than days past due  or earlier when concern exists as to the ultimate collection of principal or interest 
when a loan or loan pool is placed on nonaccrual status  we reverse the accrual for unpaid interest and do not recognize interest income until the cash is received and the loan returns to accrual status 
generally  a performing loan or loan pool may be returned to accrual status when all delinquent principal and interest are brought current in accordance with the terms of the loan agreement and certain performance criteria have been met by the borrower 
non performing loans or loan pools are placed on accrual status ie interest income is recognized when we have sufficient information to make a reasonable estimate of cash flows expected to be collected  generally within twelve months of acquisition 
cash flows expected to be collected from loans or loan pools acquired with evidence of deteriorated credit quality are evaluated on a quarterly basis 
factors that we consider in estimating cash flows for each loan or loan pool include the expected resolution strategy for each loan or loan pool ie full payoff  discounted payoff  secondary loan sale  foreclosure  etc  the estimated value of the underlying real estate collateral  timing of expected cash flows  and any guarantees or other collateral provided by the borrower 
significant judgment is required in estimating cash flows expected to be collected from loans or loan pools acquired with evidence of deteriorated credit quality  and it is reasonably possible that actual results could differ significantly from our estimates 
we evaluate loans and loan pools for impairment on a quarterly basis  and recognize impairment when it is probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or  for loans or loan pools acquired at a discount to face value  when it is deemed probable that we will not be able to collect all amounts estimated to be collected at the time of acquisition 
we measure impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan or loan pool s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral  if the loan is collateral dependent 
upon measurement of impairment  we record an allowance to reduce the carrying value of the loan or loan pool and record a corresponding charge to net income 

table of contents significant judgment is required in determining impairment  including making assumptions regarding the value of the loan or loan pool  the value of the underlying collateral and other provisions such as guarantees 
for the year ended december  and the period from june  date of inception through december   we did not record any impairment losses on loans or loan pools held directly or indirectly through our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
income taxes we elected to be taxed as a reit  commencing with our initial taxable year ended december  a reit is generally not subject to corporate level federal and state income tax on net income it distributes to its stockholders 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement to distribute at least of our taxable income to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal and state income taxes at regular corporate rates including any applicable alternative minimum tax and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent taxable years 
even if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we and our subsidiaries may be subject to certain federal  state  local and foreign taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 
we have elected or may elect to treat certain of our subsidiaries as trss 
in general  a trs of a reit may perform non customary services for tenants of the reit  hold assets that the reit cannot hold directly and  subject to certain exceptions related to hotels and healthcare properties  may engage in any real estate or non real estate related business 
a trs is treated as a regular corporation and is subject to federal  state  local  and foreign taxes on its income and property

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of cash are to fund acquisitions of our target assets and related ongoing commitments  to fund our operations  including overhead costs and the management fee to our manager  to fund distributions to our stockholders and  to the extent we utilize leverage to acquire our target assets  to repay principal and interest on our borrowings 
we expect to meet our capital requirements using cash on hand  our credit facility  cash flow generated from our operations  and principal and interest payments received from our investments 
however  because of distribution requirements imposed on us to qualify as a reit  which generally require that we distribute to our stockholders of our taxable income  our ability to finance our growth must largely be funded by external sources of capital 
as a result  we will have to rely on third party sources of capital  including public and private offerings of securities and debt financings  which may or may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
private placement on december   we raised million  after offering costs  in the private placement 
see business recent developments private placement 
credit facility our other main source of liquidity is our credit facility 
on september   the company and certain of our subsidiaries entered into the credit agreement pursuant to which the lenders thereunder agreed to provide a credit facility in the initial aggregate principal amount of up to million  as further described below 
the credit agreement also provides the company the option to increase the aggregate principal amount of commitments to million under certain conditions set forth in the credit agreement  including each lender under the credit agreement or a substitute lender agreeing to provide commitments for such increased amount 
we use the credit facility to finance the acquisition of mortgage loans and other real estate related debt investments  and as a general source of liquidity for our operations 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under the credit agreement  which was paid off in january revolving loans under the credit agreement accrue interest at a per annum rate equal to the sum of  at our election  the one  two  three  six  or twelve month libor plus  with a libor floor 
in addition  we pay a commitment fee of of the unused amount 
during the existence of an event of default  as defined in the credit agreement  interest accrues at the default rate which is the base rate plus 
the base rate is an interest rate per annum equal to the highest of a the federal funds rate plus of  b the bank of america prime rate and c the one month libor plus  plus 
the amount available for draw under the credit agreement is limited by a borrowing base  which is calculated based upon the value of eligible assets and the annual cash flow generated by these assets 
to be included in the borrowing base an asset must meet certain criteria set forth in the credit agreement  including being free of all liens and pledges and  when taken with all other borrowing base assets  the average time to maturity must be at least years 
at march   the borrowing base was million  with no outstanding borrowings 
the initial maturity date of the credit agreement is september   subject to a one year extension option  which may be exercised by the company upon the company s satisfaction of certain conditions set forth in the credit agreement 
any revolving loans outstanding under the credit agreement upon maturity will convert automatically to fully amortizing one year term loans payable in quarterly installments 
in the event of such conversions  the term loans will continue to bear interest at the same rate as the revolving loans from which they were converted 

table of contents certain of our subsidiaries provided a continuing guaranty the guaranty under which such subsidiaries guaranty the obligations of the company under the credit agreement 
as security for the advances under the credit agreement  the company and certain of our affiliates pledged our equity interests in certain subsidiaries through which we directly or indirectly own substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreement and the guaranty contain various affirmative and negative covenants  including the following financial covenants applicable to the company and our consolidated subsidiaries a minimum consolidated tangible net worth greater than or equal to the sum of i of our gaap equity as of the closing date and ii of the net proceeds of future equity issuances by the company  b earnings before income tax  depreciation and amortization ebitda to fixed charges as of the end of each fiscal quarter not less than to  c minimum liquidity not less than the lesser of million including undrawn amounts available under the credit agreement and of total gaap consolidated assets  and d the ratio of consolidated gaap debt to consolidated gaap assets must not exceed 
at december   we were in compliance with all of these financial covenants 
the credit agreement restricts our ability to incur indebtedness to borrowings under the credit agreement and non recourse debt not to exceed of our total assets  which must not be secured by any of the borrowing base assets 
we do not anticipate these restrictions to have a material effect on our financial condition or operations 
the credit agreement also includes customary events of default  in certain cases subject to reasonable and customary periods to cure  including but not limited to failure to make payments when due  breach of covenants  breach of representations and warranties  insolvency proceedings  certain judgments and attachments  change of control  and failure to maintain status as a reit 
the occurrence of an event of default may result in the termination of the credit facility  accelerate our repayment obligations  in certain cases limit our ability to make distributions  and allow the lenders to exercise all rights and remedies available to them with respect to the collateral 
other sources of liquidity the structured transactions with the fdic were consummated in part with leverage provided by the fdic  and one of our co investments with investment funds managed by affiliates of our manager utilized funds made available under the talf 
we also secured investment level financing on our grand loan by assignment of an a note participation and may attempt to secure other investment level financing  if available  including term loans  securitizations  warehouse facilities  repurchase agreements and the issuance of debt and equity securities 
we also expect to continue to invest in a number of our assets through co investments with other investment vehicles managed by affiliates of our manager and or other third parties  which may allow us to pool capital to access larger transactions and diversify investment exposure

dividends we have made regular quarterly distributions to holders of our common stock 
us federal income tax law generally requires that a reit distribute annually at least of its reit taxable income  without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains  and that it pay tax at regular corporate rates to the extent that it annually distributes less than of its net taxable income 
we intend to pay regular quarterly dividends to our stockholders in an amount equal to our net taxable income  if and to the extent authorized by our board of directors 
before we pay any dividend  whether for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise  we must first meet both our operating requirements and debt service  if any 
in addition  our credit facility limits the annual amount of distributions we can make to the greater of i of our net income adjusted by any non cash impairment charges  write downs or losses and ii of our taxable income 
if our cash available for distribution is less than our net taxable income  we could be required to sell assets or borrow funds to make cash distributions or we may make a portion of the required distribution in the form of a taxable stock distribution or distribution of debt securities

we believe that core earnings is a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance 
the exclusion from core earnings of the items specified above allows investors and analysts to readily identify the operating results of the assets that form the core of our activity and assists in comparing those operating results between periods 
core earnings is also the basis upon which the incentive fee to our manager is calculated and is a key factor in determining the performance hurdle for the reimbursement of our manager s partial payment of the initial underwriting discounts and commissions see business our manager and the management agreement reimbursement of manager s partial payment of ipo underwriting discounts and commissions 
also  as some of our competitors use a similar supplemental measure  it facilitates comparisons of operating performance to other mortgage reits 
however  other mortgage reits may use different methodologies to calculate core earnings  and accordingly  our core earnings may not be comparable to all other mortgage reits 
core earnings does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by gaap  should not be considered as an alternative to net income as defined by gaap and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs

as a result  interest rates and other factors influence our performance more so than inflation  although inflation rates can often have a meaningful influence over the direction of interest rates

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk includes the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  credit curve spreads  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices and credit risk in our underlying investments 
the primary market risks to which the company is exposed  either directly or indirectly through its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  are credit risk  interest rate risk  credit curve spread risk and foreign currency risk 

table of contents credit risk our joint venture investments and loans receivable are subject to a high degree of credit risk 
credit risk is the exposure to loss from loan defaults 
default rates are subject to a wide variety of factors  including  but not limited to  borrower financial condition  property performance  property management  supply demand factors  construction trends  consumer behavior  regional economics  interest rates  the strength of the us economy  and other factors beyond our control 
all loans are subject to a certain probability of default 
we manage credit risk through the underwriting process  acquiring our investments at the appropriate discount to face value  if any  and establishing loss assumptions 
we also carefully monitor the performance of the loans  including those held by the joint ventures  as well as external factors that may affect their value 
interest rate and credit curve spread risk interest rate risk relates to the risk that the fair value of future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes in market interest rates 
interest rate risk is highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental  monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
credit curve spread risk is highly sensitive to the dynamics of the markets for commercial real estate loans and securities we hold 
excessive supply of these assets combined with reduced demand will cause the market to require a higher yield 
this demand for higher yield will cause the market to use a higher spread over the us treasury securities yield curve  or other benchmark interest rates  to value these assets 
the majority of the performing loans held by our unconsolidated joint ventures are fixed rate loans 
as us treasury securities are priced to a higher yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the assets increases  the price at which the joint ventures could sell some of the assets may decline 
conversely  as us treasury securities are priced to a lower yield and or the spread to us treasuries used to price the assets decreases  the value of the loan portfolios may increase 
in addition  fluctuations in libor rates may affect the amount of interest expense we incur in connection with borrowings under our credit facility  which incur interest expense at a per annum rate equal to the sum of  at our election  the one  two  three  six  or twelve month libor plus  with a libor floor 
increases in libor rates above would result in increased interest expense to the company 
we had outstanding borrowings of million under the credit facility as of december  which bore interest at plus the libor floor 
the amount was fully repaid in january and we and our unconsolidated joint ventures did not have any other variable rate debt as of december  therefore there is no interest rate sensitivity for debt outstanding as of december  as of december   we and our unconsolidated joint ventures did not have any interest rate hedges 
however  in the future  we or our unconsolidated joint ventures may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts  in order to limit the effects of fluctuations in interest rates on our operations 
the use of these types of derivatives to hedge interest earning assets and or interest bearing liabilities carries certain risks  including the risk that losses on a hedge position will reduce the funds available for distribution and that such losses may exceed the amount invested in such instruments 
a hedge may not perform its intended purpose of offsetting losses of rising interest rates 
moreover  with respect to certain of the instruments used as hedges  we are exposed to the risk that the counterparties with which we trade may cease making markets and quoting prices in such instruments  which may render us unable to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to an open position 
if we anticipate that the income from any such hedging transaction will not be qualifying income for reit income purposes  we may conduct all or part of our hedging activities through a to be formed corporate subsidiary that is fully subject to federal corporate income taxation 
our profitability may be adversely affected during any period as a result of changing interest rates 
currency risk we have foreign currency rate exposures related to our equity investments in joint ventures which hold certain commercial real estate loan investments in europe 
our sole currency exposure is to the euro 
changes in 
table of contents currency rates can adversely impact the fair values and earnings of our non us holdings 
as of december   we had approximately million  or million  in european investments 
net accumulated foreign exchange losses on the european investments were approximately million  before tax effect 
a change in the exchange rate would result in a million increase or decrease in translation gain or loss on our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
we mitigate this impact by utilizing currency instruments to hedge the capital portion of its foreign currency risk 
the type of hedging instrument that we employed on our european investments was a costless collar buying a protective put while writing an out of the money covered call with a strike price at which the premium received is equal to the premium of the protective put purchased which involved no initial capital outlay 
the puts were structured with strike prices approximately lower than our cost basis in such investments  thereby limiting any euro related foreign exchange related fluctuations to approximately of the original capital invested in the deal 
at december   we had fourteen outstanding collars with an aggregate notional amount of million and a net fair value of million 
the maturity dates of such instruments approximate the projected dates of related cash flows for specific investments 
termination or maturity of currency hedging instruments may result in an obligation for payment to or from the counterparty to the hedging agreement 
during the year ended december   full or partial termination of collars hedging the our net investments in laguna investor  crystal investor and ford investor resulted in net cash receipts of  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by counterparties for these contracts 
to manage this risk  we select major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties and perform a quarterly review of the financial health and stability of our trading counterparties 
based on our review as of december   we do not expect any counterparty to default on its obligations
