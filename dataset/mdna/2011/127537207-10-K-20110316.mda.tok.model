item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
c narrative description of business our business strategy is the development of our landholdings for their highest and best uses 
at present  our development activities include water resource  agricultural and solar energy development 
water resource development our portfolio of water resources is located in proximity to the colorado river and the colorado river aqueduct cra  the principal source of imported water for southern california  and provides us with the opportunity to participate in a variety of water supply  water storage  and conservation programs with public agencies and other partners 
the cadiz valley water conservation  recovery and storage project we own approximately  acres of land and the subsurface strata  inclusive of the unsaturated soils and appurtenant water rights in the cadiz and fenner valleys of eastern san bernardino county the cadiz fenner property 
the aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation both rain and snow within a watershed of approximately  square miles 
see item  properties the cadiz fenner valley property 
the cadiz valley water conservation  recovery and storage project the water project is designed to supply  capture and conserve billions of gallons of renewable native groundwater currently being lost annually to evaporation from the aquifer system underlying our cadiz fenner property 
by implementing established groundwater management practices  the water project will create a new  sustainable water supply for project participants without adversely impacting the aquifer system or the desert environment 
the total quantity of groundwater to be recovered and conveyed to project participants will not exceed a long term annual average of approximately  acre feet per year 
the project also offers participants the ability to carry over their annual supply and store it in the groundwater b asin from year to year  as well as approximately one million acre feet of storage capacity that can be used to store imported water 
water project facilities would include  among other things high yield wells designed to efficiently recover available native groundwater from beneath the cadiz project area  a mile conveyance pipeline to connect the well field to the cra  a pumping plant to pump water through the conveyance pipeline from the cra to the project well field  an energy source to provide power to the well field  pipeline and pumping plant  and spreading basins  which are shallow settling ponds that will be configured to efficiently percolate water from the ground surface down to the water table using subsurface storage capacity for the storage of water  if an imported water storage component of the project is ultimately implemented 
in general  several elements are needed to implement such a project a pipeline right of way from the colorado river aqueduct to the water project area  storage and supply agreements with one or more public water agencies or private water utilities  environmental permits  and construction and working capital financing 
as described below  the first three elements have been progressed on a concurrent basis 
the fourth is dependent on actions arising from the completion of the first three 
a pipeline right of way from the colorado river aqueduct to the water project area in september  we secured a right of way for the water project s water conveyance pipeline by entering into a lease agreement with the arizona california railroad company 
the agreement allows for the use of a portion of the railroad s right of way for a period up to years to construct and operate the water project s water conveyance pipeline 
the pipeline would be used to convey water between our cadiz fenner property and the colorado river aqueduct 
storage and supply agreements with one or more public water agencies or private water utilities in june  we entered into option and environmental cost sharing agreements with three water providers santa margarita water district smwd  golden state water company a wholly owned subsidiary of american states water 
nyse awr  and three valleys municipal water district 
the three water providers serve more than one million customers in cities throughout california s san bernardino  riverside  los angeles  orange and ventura counties 
in september  we also entered into option and environmental cost sharing agreements with suburban water systems  a wholly owned subsidiary of southwest water company 
suburban water systems provides water to a population of approximately  people in a square mile service area in california los angeles and orange counties 
under the terms of the agreements with the four water providers  upon completion of the water project s california environmental quality act ceqa review  each agency will have the right to acquire an annual supply of  acre feet of water at a pre determined formula competitive with their incremental cost of new water 
smwd also was given the option to purchase an additional  acre feet of water per year 
in addition  the agencies have options to acquire storage rights in the water project to allow them to manage their supplies to complement their other water resources 
we continue to work with additional water providers interested in acquiring rights to the remaining annual supply expected to be conserved by the water project and are in discussions with third parties regarding the imported storage aspect of this project 
we have also begun to develop an operating plan for the water project that will manage the delivery of conserved water to the project s subscribers 
environmental permits in order to properly develop and quantify the sustainability of the water project  and prior to initiating the formal permitting process for the water project  we commissioned internationally recognized environmental consulting firm chm hill to complete a comprehensive study of the water resources at the project area 
following a year of analysis  chm hill released its study of the aquifer system in february utilizing new models produced by the us geological survey in and  the study estimated the total groundwater in storage in the aquifer system to be between and million acre feet  a quantity on par with lake mead  the nation s largest surface reservoir 
the study also identified a renewable annual supply of native grou ndwater in the aquifer system currently being lost to evaporation 
chm hill s findings  which were peer reviewed by leading groundwater experts  confirmed that the aquifer system could sustainably support the water project 
further  and also prior to beginning the formal environmental permitting process  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the natural heritage institute nhi  a leading global environmental organization committed to protecting aquatic ecosystems  to assist with our efforts to sustainably manage the development of our cadiz fenner property 
as part of this green compact  we will follow stringent plans for groundwater management and habitat conservation  and create a groundwater management plan for the water project 
in june  as discussed in  above  we entered into environmental cost sharing agreements with all participating water providers 
the environmental cost sharing agreements created a framework for funds to be committed by each participant to share in the costs associated with the ongoing ceqa review work 
smwd has agreed to serve as the lead agency for the review process 
in july  esa associates  a leading environmental consulting firm  was retained to prepare the formal ceqa documentation 
in february  smwd issued a notice of preparation of a draft environmental impact report deir formally commencing the public portion of the ceqa permitting process for the water project 
construction and working capital once the environmental review is concluded  we expect that we will complete economic agreements with the water project participants and make arrangements for the construction phase of the water project 
construction would consist of well field facilities at the water project site and a conveyance pipeline extending approximately miles along the right of way described in  above  from the well field to the colorado river aqueduct 
other eastern mojave properties our second largest landholding is approximately  acres in the piute valley of eastern san bernardino county 
this landholding is located approximately miles from the resort community of laughlin  nevada  and about miles from the colorado river town of needles  california 
extensive hydrological studies  including the drilling and testing of a full scale production well  have demonstrated that this landholding is underlain by high quality groundwater 
the aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation both rain and snow within a watershed of approximately square miles 
discussions with potential partners with the objective of developing our piute valley assets are ongoing 
additionally  we own acreage located near danby dry lake  approximately miles southeast of our landholdings in the cadiz and fenner valleys 
the danby lake property is located approximately miles north of the cra 
initial hydrological studies indicate that it has excellent potential for a water supply project 
agricultural development within the cadiz fenner property   acres have been zoned for agriculture 
the infrastructure includes seven wells that are interconnected within this acreage  with total annual production capacity of approximately  acre feet of water 
additionally  there are housing and kitchen facilities that support up to employees 
the underlying groundwater  fertile soil  and desert temperatures are well suited for a wide variety of fruits and vegetables 
permanent crops currently in commercial production include acres of vineyards of certified organic  dried on the vine raisins and acres of lemons 
both of these crops are farmed using sustainable agricultural practices 
seasonal vegetable crops in included squash and beans 
all seasonal vegetable crops are grown organically 
we currently derive our agricultural revenues through the sale of our products in bulk or through independent packing facilities 
we incur all of the costs necessary to produce and harvest our organic raisin crop 
these raisins are then sold in bulk to a raisin processing facility 
we also incur all of the costs necessary to produce our lemon crop 
once harvested  the lemons are shipped in bulk to a packing and sales facility 
in recent periods  our agricultural revenues have declined largely due to the removal of acres of vineyard during the years through as the vineyard reached the end of its commercial life 
in  we entered into a lease agreement with a third party to replace the acreage that was taken out of production by developing up to an additiona l acres of lemon orchards 
we expect to receive lease income once the new lemon orchards reach commercial production through a profit sharing agreement within the lease 
the first acres of this new orchard were planted in march although we plan to maintain our agricultural development  revenues will continue to vary from year to year based on acres in development  crop yields  and prices 
further  we do not believe that our agricultural revenues are likely to be material to our overall results of operations once we begin to receive revenues from the water project 
renewable energy and other development opportunities in addition to the projects described above  we believe that our landholdings are suitable for other types of development  including solar energy production 
located in an area with strong solar irradiation  proximity to existing utility corridors  appropriate topography  and access to water supplies  our properties could provide an ideal setting for solar energy generation 
moreover  state  federal and local government entities  along with environmental organizations  have issued compelling calls to increase the production of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of imported fossil fuels 
solar energy development on private land  particularly in the mojave desert region where our properties are located  is being encouraged as an alternative to the use of federal desert l ands 
we believe that we can ease the demand for the use of federal lands for siting solar facilities in the mojave desert by providing solar development opportunities on our significant  contiguous private landholdings 
up to  acres at our cadiz fenner property could potentially be made available for solar energy projects 
we are presently in discussions with energy companies interested in utilizing our landholdings for various types of solar energy development 
in addition to solar energy development  we believe that over the longer term  the population of southern california  nevada  and arizona will continue to grow  and that  in time  the economics of commercial and residential development of our properties will become attractive 
we remain committed to the ongoing sustainable use of our land and water assets  and will continue to explore all opportunities for environmentally responsible development of these assets 
we cannot predict with certainty which of these various opportunities will ultimately be utilized 
seasonality our water resource development activities are not seasonal in nature 
our farming operations are limited to the cultivation of lemons and grapes raisins and spring and fall plantings of vegetables on the cadiz valley properties 
these operations are subject to the general seasonal trends that are characteristic of the agricultural industry 
competition we face competition for the acquisition  development and sale of our properties from a number of competitors 
we may also face competition in the development of water resources and siting of renewable energy facilities associated with our properties 
since california has scarce water resources and an increasing demand for available water  we believe that location  price and reliability of delivery are the principal competitive factors affecting transfers of water in california 
employees as of december   we employed full time employees ie those individuals working more than  hours per year 
we believe that our employee relations are good 
regulation our operations are subject to varying degrees of federal  state and local laws and regulations 
as we proceed with the development of our properties  including the water project  we will be required to satisfy various regulatory authorities that we are in compliance with the laws  regulations and policies enforced by such authorities 
groundwater development  and the export of surplus groundwater for sale to entities such as public water agencies  is subject to regulation by specific existing statutes  in addition to general environmental statutes applicable to all development projects 
additionally  we must obtain a variety of approvals and permits from state and federal governments with respect to issues that may include environmental issues  issues related to special status species  issues related to t he public trust  and others 
because of the discretionary nature of these approvals and concerns which may be raised by various governmental officials  public interest groups and other interested parties during both the development and the approval process  our ability to develop properties and realize income from our projects  including the water project  could be delayed  reduced or eliminated 
access to our information our annual  quarterly and current reports  proxy statements and other information are filed with the securities and exchange commission sec and are available free of charge through our web site  www

item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a number of risks  including those described below 
our development activities have not generated significant revenues at present  our development activities include water resource  agricultural and solar energy development at our san bernardino county properties 
we have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date and we do not know when  if ever  we will receive operating revenues sufficient to offset the costs of our development activities 
as a result  we continue to incur a net loss from operations 
we may never generate significant revenues or become profitable unless we are able to successfully implement programs to develop our land assets and related water resources we do not know the terms  if any  upon which we may be able to proceed with our water and other development programs 
regardless of the form of our water development programs  the circumstances under which supplies or storage of water can be developed and the profitability of any supply or storage project are subject to significant uncertainties  including the risk of variable water supplies and changing water allocation priorities 
additional risks include our ability to obtain all necessary regulatory approvals and permits  possible litigation by environmental or other groups  unforeseen technical difficulties  general market conditions for water supplies  and the time needed to generate significant operating revenues from such programs after operations commence 
the development of our properties is heavily regulated  requires governmental approvals and permits that could be denied  and may have competing governmental interests and objectives in developing our land assets and related water resources  we are subject to local  state  and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  resource protection  environmental impacts  infrastructure design  subdivision of land  construction and similar matters 
our development activities are subject to the risk of adverse interpretations or changes to us federal  state and local laws  regulations and policies 
further  our development activities require governmental approvals and permits 
if such permits were to be denied or granted subject to unfavorable conditions or restrictions  our ability to successfully implement our development programs would be adversely impacted 
the opposition of government officials may adversely affect our ability to obtain needed government approvals and permits upon satisfactory terms in a timely manner 
in this regard  federal government appropriations currently preclude spending for any proposal to store water for the purpose of export or for any activities associated with the approval of rights of way on lands managed by the needles field office of the bureau of land management 
as a result of our right of way with the arizona california railroad company  we do not believe federal approval will be required to implement the project  however  even this may be subject to challenges 
a significant portion of our cadiz fenner property is included in a study area as part of an ongoing environmental impact statement eis process for the expansion of the marine corp air ground combat center in twentynine palms  california 
there are currently six different alternatives being considered for base expansion and our property  including portions of the project area and agricultural operations  are included in one of the six different alternatives being studied 
this alternative  however  was not selected as the preferred alternative in the base expansion project draft environmental impact statement deis issued by the us department of the navy in february as a result  we do not believe that our property will ultimate ly be impacted by expansion of the base 
in the event any of the cadiz fenner valley landholdings are included in the final expansion area  then we would be entitled to full fair market value compensation for any property taken 
additionally  the statutes  regulations and ordinances governing the approval processes provide third parties the opportunity to challenge proposed plans and approvals 
in california  third parties have the ability to file litigation challenging the approval of a project  which they usually do by alleging inadequate disclosure and mitigation of the environmental impacts of the project 
opposition from environmental groups could cause delays and increase the costs of our development efforts or preclude such development entirely 
while we have worked with representatives of various environmental interests and agencies to minimize and mitigate the impacts of our planned projects  certain groups may remain opposed to our development plans 
our failure to make timely payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness may result in a foreclosure on our assets as of december   we had indebtedness outstanding to our senior secured lenders of approximately million 
our assets have been put up as collateral for this debt 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow to make principal and interest payments on this indebtedness when due  or if we otherwise fail to comply with the terms of agreements governing our indebtedness  we may default on our obligations 
if we default on our obligations  our lenders may sell off the assets that we have put up as collateral 
this  in turn  would result in a cessation or sale of our operations 
the conversion of our outstanding senior indebtedness into common stock would dilute the percentage of our common stock held by current stockholders our senior indebtedness is convertible into common stock at the election of our lenders 
as of december   our senior indebtedness was convertible into  shares of our common stock  an amount equal to approximately of the number of fully diluted shares of our common stock outstanding as of that date 
an election by our lenders to convert all or a portion of our senior secured indebtedness into common stock will dilute the percentage of our common stock held by current stockholders 
we may not be able to obtain the financing we need to implement our asset development programs based upon our current and anticipated usage of cash resources  we have sufficient funds to meet our expected working capital needs through fiscal year we will continue to require additional working capital to meet our cash resource needs from that point forward and to continue to finance our operations until such time as our asset development programs produce revenues 
if we cannot raise needed funds  we might be forced to make substantial reductions in our operating expenses  which could adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company 
we cannot assure you that our current lenders  or any other lenders  will give us additional credit should we seek it 
if we are unable to obtain additional credit  we may engage in furthe r equity financings 
our ability to obtain equity financing will depend  among other things  on the status of our asset development programs and general conditions in the capital markets at the time funding is sought 
although we currently expect our capital sources to be sufficient to meet our near term liquidity needs  there can be no assurance that our liquidity requirements will continue to be satisfied 
any further equity financings would result in the dilution of ownership interests of our current stockholders 
the issuance of equity securities under management equity incentive plans will impact earnings our compensation programs for management emphasize long term incentives  primarily through the issuance of equity securities and options to purchase equity securities 
it is expected that plans involving the issuance of shares  options  or both will be submitted from time to time to our stockholders for approval 
in the event that any such plans are approved and implemented  the issuance of shares and options under such plans may result in the dilution of the ownership interest of other stockholders and will  under currently applicable accounting rules  result in a charge to earnings based on the value of our common stock at the time of issue and the fair value of options at the time of their award 
the expense would be recorded over the vesting period of each stock and option grant 
item b 
unresolved staff comments not applicable at this time 
item properties following is a description of our significant properties 
the cadiz fenner valley property since  we have acquired approximately  acres of largely contiguous land in the cadiz and fenner valleys of eastern san bernardino county  california 
this area is located approximately miles north of the colorado river aqueduct cra 
in  we conducted investigations of the feasibility of agricultural development of this land 
these investigations confirmed the availability of high quality groundwater in quantities appropriate for agricultural development 
additional independent geotechnical and engineering studies conducted since have confirmed that the cadiz fenner property overlies an aquifer system that is ideally suited for the conservation  recovery and delivery of indigenous groundwater as well as the storage of conserved or imported water  as contemplated by the water project 
see item  business narrative description of business water resource development 
in november  the san bernardino county board of supervisors unanimously approved a general plan amendment establishing an agricultural land use designation for  acres of the property 
this action also allows for the withdrawal of more than  acre feet of groundwater from the aquifer system underlying the property 
in february  we released new details of a comprehensive year long study measuring the vast scale and recharge rate of the cadiz fenner aquifer system 
the study was conducted by internationally recognized environmental consulting firm chm hill at the project area utilizing new models produced by the us geological survey in and chm hill and additional hydrology experts that have peer reviewed the work confirmed the aquifer system can sustainably support the water project 
other eastern mojave properties we also own approximately  additional acres in the eastern mojave desert  including the piute and danby dry lake properties 
our second largest property consists of approximately  acres in the piute valley of eastern san bernardino county 
this landholding is located approximately miles from the resort community of laughlin  nevada  and about miles from the colorado river town of needles  california 
extensive hydrological studies  including the drilling and testing of a full scale production well  have demonstrated that this landholding is underlain by high quality groundwater 
the aquifer system underlying this property is naturally recharged by precipitation both rain and snow within a watershed of approximately square miles 
discussions with potential partners have commenced with the objective of developing our piute valley assets 
additionally  we own acreage located near danby dry lake  approximately miles southeast of our cadiz fenner landholdings 
our danby dry lake property is located approximately miles north of the colorado river aqueduct 
initial hydrological studies indicate that it has excellent potential for water supply 
executive offices we lease approximately  square feet of office space in los angeles  california for our executive offices 
the lease terminates in october current base rent under the lease is approximately  per month 
cadiz real estate in december  we transferred substantially all of our assets with the exception of our office sublease  certain office furniture and equipment and any sun world related assets to cadiz real estate llc  a delaware limited liability company cadiz real estate 
we hold of the equity interests of cadiz real estate  and therefore we continue to hold beneficial ownership of the properties that we transferred to cadiz real estate 
the board of managers of cadiz real estate currently consists of two managers appointed by us 
cadiz real estate is a co obligor under our senior secured convertible term loan  for which assets of cadiz real estate have been pledged as security 
because the transfer of our properties to cadiz real estate has no effect on our ultimate beneficial ownership of these properties  we refer throughout this report to properties owned of record either by cadiz real estate or by us as our properties 
debt secured by properties our assets have been pledged as collateral for million of debt outstanding on december  information regarding interest rates and principal maturities is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements

forward looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as intends  anticipates  believes  estimates  projects  forecasts  expects  plans and proposes 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions  there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward looking statements 
these include  among others  our ability to maximize value from our land and water resources and our ability to obtain new financings as needed to meet our o ngoing working capital needs 
see additional discussion under the heading risk factors above 
overview our primary asset consists of  acres of land in three areas of eastern san bernardino county  california 
virtually all of this land is underlain by high quality  naturally recharging groundwater resources  and is situated in proximity to the colorado river and the colorado river aqueduct  the major source of imported water for southern california 
our main objective is to realize the highest and best use of these land and water resources in an environmentally responsible way 
in  we secured permits for up to  acres of agricultural development at our  acre property in the cadiz valley and the withdrawal of more than one million acre feet of groundwater from the underlying aquifer system 
since that time  we have maintained various levels of agricultural development at the property and this development has provided our principal source of revenue 
although sustainable agricultural development is an important and enduring component of our business  we believe that the long term value of our assets can best be derived through the development of a combination of water supply  water storage  and solar energy projects at our properties 
the primary factors that drive the value of water supply projects are continued population growth and increasing pressure on water supplies throughout california 
southern california in particular now faces the prospect of long term and systematic water supply shortages resulting from restrictions on each of its three imported water sources the state water project  the colorado river and the owens valley 
as a result of these restrictions  water agencies must overcome significant projected supply deficiencies to meet existing and projected demands 
for example  despite experiencing above average rainfall in each of the last two years  ongoing environmental and regulatory restrictions affecting california s water supplies and infrastructure have forced many water providers to limit water deliveries to their customers 
given that the present imbalance in annual supply and demand is projected to continue for many years into the future  water providers are now evaluating new sources of supply as a method to off set their existing shortages 
opportunities in the solar energy production market are being driven by a series of policy initiatives issued by the state of california and the united states government 
this includes california s mandate to acquire of the state s electricity from renewable sources by and federal efforts to accelerate renewable energy and transmission project development in the mojave desert 
energy companies  government agencies and environmental organizations are actively working to identify suitable locations for solar energy development to meet future energy needs and have encouraged development on private lands 
as a result of these developments in the water and energy sectors  we plan to continue to pursue water supply  water storage and solar energy projects at our properties 
at present  our development efforts are primarily focused on the cadiz valley water conservation  recovery and storage project water project  which involves the capture  delivery and storage of groundwater that is otherwise lost to evaporation 
we believe that the ultimate implementation of this water project will create the primary source of our future cash flow and  accordingly  our working capital requirements relate largely to the development activities associated with this water project 
water resource development the water project involves the capture  delivery and storage of groundwater that would otherwise be lost to evaporation 
the water project would be designed  constructed and operated in accordance with prudent groundwater management principles so as to maximize the reasonable and beneficial use of groundwater  and avoid waste and harm to the environment or other consumptive users 
in general  several elements are needed to implement such a project a pipeline right of way from the colorado river aqueduct to the water project area  storage and supply agreements with one or more public water agencies or private water utilities  environmental permits  and construction and working capital financing 
as described below  the first three elements have been progressed on a concurrent basis 
the fourth is dependent on actions arising from the completion of the first three 
a pipeline right of way from the colorado river aqueduct to the water project area in september  we secured a right of way for the water project s water conveyance pipeline by entering into a lease agreement with the arizona california railroad company 
the agreement allows for the use of a portion of the railroad s right of way for a period up to years to construct and operate the water project s water conveyance pipeline 
the pipeline would be used to convey water between our cadiz fenner property and the colorado river aqueduct 
storage and supply agreements with one or more public water agencies or private water utilities in june  we entered into option and environmental cost sharing agreements with three water providers santa margarita water district smwd  golden state water company a wholly owned subsidiary of american states water 
nyse awr 
and three valleys municipal water district 
the three water providers serve more than one million customers in cities throughout california s san bernardino  riverside  los angeles  orange and ventura counties 
in september  we also entered into option and environmental cost sharing agreements with suburban water systems  a wholly owned subsidiary of southwest water company 
suburban water systems provides water to a population of approximately  people in a square mile service area in california los angeles and orange counties 
under the terms of the agreements with the four water providers  upon completion of the water project s california environmental quality act ceqa review  each agency will have the right to acquire an annual supply of  acre feet of water at a pre determined formula competitive with their incremental cost of new water 
smwd also was given the option to purchase an additional  acre feet of water per year 
in addition  the agencies have options to acquire storage rights in the water project to allow them to manage their supplies to complement their other water resources 
the option agreements had no impact on our operations  financial position  or cash flows for the year ended december  we continue to work with additional water providers interested in acquiring rights to the remaining annual supply expected to be conserved by the water project and are in discussions with third parties regarding the imported storage aspect of this project 
we have also begun to develop an operating plan for the water project that will manage the delivery of conserved water to the project s subscribers 
environmental permits in order to properly develop and quantify the sustainability of the water project  and prior to initiating the formal permitting process for the water project  we commissioned internationally recognized environmental consulting firm chm hill to complete a comprehensive study of the water resources at the project area

the study also identified a renewable annual supply of native groundwate r in the aquifer system currently being lost to evaporation 
chm hill s findings  which were peer reviewed by leading groundwater experts  confirmed that the aquifer system could sustainably support the water project 
further  and also prior to beginning the formal environmental permitting process  we entered into a memorandum of understanding with the natural heritage institute nhi  a leading global environmental organization committed to protecting aquatic ecosystems  to assist with our efforts to sustainably manage the development of our cadiz fenner property 
as part of this green compact  we will follow stringent plans for groundwater management and habitat conservation  and create a groundwater management plan for the water project 
in june  as discussed in  above  we entered into environmental cost sharing agreements with all participating water providers 
the environmental cost sharing agreements created a framework for funds to be committed by each participant to share in the costs associated with the ongoing ceqa review work 
smwd has agreed to serve as the lead agency for the review process 
in july  esa associates  a leading environmental consulting firm  was retained to prepare the formal ceqa documentation 
in february  smwd issued a notice of preparation of a draft environmental impact report deir formally commencing the public portion of the ceqa permitting process for the water project 
construction and working capital once the environmental review is concluded  we expect that we will complete economic agreements with the water project participants and make arrangements for the construction phase of the water project 
construction would consist of well field facilities at the water project site and a conveyance pipeline extending approximately miles along the right of way described in  above  from the well field to the colorado river aqueduct

in recent periods  our agricultural revenues have declined largely due to the removal of acres of vineyard during the years through as the vineyard reached the end of its commercial life 
in  we entered into a lease agreement with a third party to replace the acreage that was taken out of production by developing up to an additiona l acres of lemon orchards 
we expect to receive lease income once the new lemon orchards reach commercial production through a profit sharing agreement within the lease 
the first acres of this new orchard were planted in march although we plan to maintain our agricultural development  revenues will continue to vary from year to year based on acres in development  crop yields  and prices 
further  we do not believe that our agricultural revenues are likely to be material to our overall results of operations once we begin to receive revenues from the water project 
renewable energy and other development opportunities in addition to the projects described above  we believe that our landholdings are suitable for other types of development  including solar energy production 
located in an area with strong solar irradiation  proximity to existing utility corridors  appropriate topography  and access to water supplies  our properties could provide an ideal setting for solar energy generation 
moreover  state  federal and local government entities  along with environmental organizations  have issued compelling calls to increase the production of renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the consumption of imported fossil fuels 
solar energy development on private land  particularly in the mojave desert region where our properties are located  is being encouraged as an alternative to the use of federal desert lands 
we believe that we can ease the demand for the use of federal lands for siting solar facilities in the mojave desert by providing solar development opportunities on our significant  contiguous private landholdings 
up to  acres at our cadiz fenner property could potentially be made available for solar energy projects 
we are presently in discussions with energy companies interested in utilizing our landholdings for various types of solar energy development 
in addition to solar energy development  we believe that over the longer term  the population of southern california  nevada  and arizona will continue to grow  and that  in time  the economics of commercial and residential development of our properties will become attractive 
we remain committed to the ongoing sustainable use of our land and water assets  and will continue to explore all opportunities for environmentally responsible development of these assets 
we cannot predict with certainty which of these various opportunities will ultimately be utilized 
results of operations a year ended december  compared to year ended december  we have not received significant revenues from our water resource and real estate development activity to date 
our revenues have been limited to our agricultural operations 
as a result  we continue to incur a net loss from operations 
we had revenues of million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is primarily due to a larger raisin and lemon harvest in in comparison to the net loss totaled million for the year ended december   compared with a net loss of million for the year ended december  the higher loss was primarily due to higher stock based non cash compensation costs related to shares and options issued under the equity incentive p lan 
our primary expenses are our ongoing overhead costs ie general and administrative expense and our interest expense 
we will continue to incur non cash expenses in connection with our management and director equity incentive compensation plans 
revenues 
revenue totaled million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  the increase in revenue was primarily due to a larger raisin and lemon harvest in in comparison to revenues included million of revenues related to citrus crop sales  which were up million from the prior year  and million of revenues related to raisin sales  which were up million from the prior year 
cost of sales 
cost of sales totaled million during the year ended december   compared with million during the year ended december  the higher cost of sales for the year ended december   related largely to a reduction in carrying costs of the raisin inventory resulting in a write down of inventory in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses during the year ended december   totaled million compared with million for the year ended december  non cash compensation costs related to stock and option awards are included in general and administrative expenses 
compensation costs from stock and option awards for the year ended december  totaled million compared with million for the year ended december  the higher expense related largely to the issuance of restricted shares and the vesting of options that were issued under our equity incentive plan 
other general and administrative expenses  exclusive of stock based compensation costs  totaled million in the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the higher expenses were primarily due to new hydrological studies and an incentive fee earned for certain legal and advisory services upon completion of milestones associated with the water project

net interest expense totaled million during the year ended december   compared to million during the following table summarizes the components of net interest expense for the two periods in thousands year ended december  interest on outstanding debt amortization of debt discount amortization of deferred loan costs interest income the interest on outstanding debt increased from million to million due to the increase in interest rate from to per annum on the senior secured convertible term loan and the increase in debt outstanding under the new working capital facility  while the amortization of debt discount decreased slightly due to extension of the accretion schedule related to the conversion option embedded in the term loan 
interest income decreased to thousand from thousand in the prior year due to lower short term interest rates and a more conservative investment policy

deferred loan costs  which are primarily legal fees  are amortized over the life of each loan agreement 
in june  we refinanced our term loan with ing capital llc ing with a new senior secured convertible term loan with a different lender

an additional  of lender fees were capitalized when the term loan was modified in october these fees will be amortized over the remaining life of the term loan 
in june and october  the term loan was modified as to certain of its conversion features 
 as a result of the of these convertible debt arrangements  the change in conversion value between the original and modified instrument totaled approximately million  which was recorded as additional debt discount with an offsetting amount recorded as additional paid in capital 
such debt discount is accreted to the redemption value of the instrument over the remaining term of the loan as additional interest expense 
in connection with the modification transaction in october  a derivative liability related to the conversion option was recorded 
this derivative liability had a fair value of thousand at december   and will be marked to market at the end of each reporting period and recorded as other income expense

liquidity and capital resources a current financing arrangements as we have not received significant revenues from our development activities to date  we have been required to obtain financing to bridge the gap between the time water resource and other development expenses are incurred and the time that revenue will commence 
historically  we have addressed these needs primarily through secured debt financing arrangements  private equity placements and the exercise of outstanding stock options and warrants 
we have worked with our secured lenders to structure our debt in a way which allows us to continue development of the water project and minimize the dilution of the ownership interests of common stockholders 
in june  we entered into a million five year zero coupon senior secured convertible term loan with peloton partners llp through an affiliate and another lender the term loan 
on april   we were advised that peloton had assigned its interest in the term loan to an affiliate of lampe conway company llc lampe conway  and lampe conway subsequently replaced peloton as administrative agent of the loan 
on june   we completed arrangements to amend the term loan with lampe conway which modified certain of the conversion features and extended the maturity date to june  on october  we closed a new million working capital facility with lampe conway and our other participating lender the lenders 
under the terms of the new million facility  the company drew the first million on the closing date first tranche 
at the company s option  it may draw up to an additional million over the months following the closing date second tranche 
all interest on outstanding balances will accrue at  with no principal or interest payments required before the new facility s june  maturity date  consistent with the company s existing term debt facility 
the first tranche including accrued interest is convertible at any time into the company s common stock at a price of per share and the second tranche including accrued interest  if drawn  would be convertible into the company s common stock at per share 
also on the closing date  the company s existing term loan with the lenders was modified as to certain of its conversion features million of the existing convertible debt has been changed to allow for up to million of this amount to be converted at any time into the company s common stock at the price of per share  with the remaining amount becoming non convertible 
if the second tranche is drawn  approximately million of additional existing debt would be changed to allow for up to million of this amount to be converted at any time into the company s common stock at per share  with the remaining amount becoming non convertible 
the final million of the existing debt continues to be convertible at per share 
the term loan is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the company  and contains representations  warranties and covenants that are typical for agreements of this type  including restrictions that would limit the company s ability to incur additional indebtedness  incur liens  pay dividends or make restricted payments  dispose of assets  make investments and merge or consolidate with another person 
however  while there are affirmative covenants  there are no financial maintenance covenants and no restrictions on the company s ability to issue additional common stock to fund future working capital needs 
as a result of the modifications of the convertible debt arrangement in june and october  the change in conversion value between the original and modified instrument totaling approximately million was recorded as additional debt discount with an offsetting amount recorded as additional paid in capital 
such debt discount is accreted to the redemption value of the instrument over the remaining term of the loan as additional interest expense 
in connection with the modification transaction in october  the company recorded a derivative liability related to the conversion option 
this derivative liability had a fair value of thousand at december   and will be marked to market at the end of each reporting period and recorded as other i ncome expense 
the debt covenants associated with the loan were negotiated by the parties with a view towards our operating and financial condition as it existed at the time the agreements were executed 
at december   we were in compliance with our debt covenants 
in november and december of  we completed a private placement of  units at the price of per unit for proceeds of  each unit consists of three shares of our common stock and two common stock purchase warrants 
the first warrant entitled the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
on november   the exercise price of this callable warrant was temporarily reduced to per share 
in response  holders of  warrants exercised their warrants  resulting in our issuance of  shares of common stock with net proceeds of  the remaining  warrants were cancelled 
the second warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise pr ice of per share 
this warrant has a term of three years and is not callable by us 
in october  the company raised million with a private placement of  units at per unit 
this includes  units purchased by the lenders of the term loan pursuant to the lenders participation rights under the term loan 
each unit consists of three shares of the company s common stock and one stock purchase warrant 
the warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant has a term of three years  but is callable by the company at any time following november   if the closing market price of the company s common stock exceeds for consecutive trading days 
as we continue to actively pursue our business strategy  additional financing will be required 
see outlook  below 
the covenants in the term loan do not prohibit our use of additional equity financing and allow us to retain of the proceeds of any equity financing 
we do not expect the loan covenants to materially limit our ability to finance our water development activities 
at december   we had no outstanding credit facilities other than the convertible term loan 
cash used for operating activities 
cash used for operating activities totaled million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the cash was primarily used to fund general and administrative expenses related to our water development efforts 
cash used in provided by investing activities 
cash used in investing activities in the year ended december   was million  compared with million of cash provided by investing activities during the same period in the period included million of short term deposits that matured  which were not considered cash equivalents 
the period included additional investments in well field and environmental work related to progressing the water project 
cash provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  the results reflect million in proceeds received under our new working capital facility 
the cash provided included million of proceeds from the issuance of  shares of common stock at per share upon exercise of outstanding warrants  and million of proceeds from a private placement 
see current financing arrangements above 
b outlook short term outlook 
the million new working capital facility  which closed on october   together with our existing cash resources  provide us with sufficient funds to meet our expected working capital needs through fiscal year based on our current and anticipated usage of cash resources  we will require additional working capital commencing during the first quarter of fiscal to meet our cash resource needs from that point forward and to continue to finance our operations until such time as our asset development programs produce revenue 
if we are unable to generate this from our current development activities  then we will need to seek additional equity financing in the c apital markets 
we expect to continue our historical practice of structuring our financing arrangements to match the anticipated needs of our development activities 
see long term outlook  below 
no assurances can be given  however  as to the availability or terms of any new financing 
long term outlook 
in the longer term  we will need to raise additional capital to finance working capital needs  capital expenditures and any payments due under our senior secured convertible term loan at maturity 
see current financing arrangements above 
payments will be due under the term loan only to the extent that lenders elect not to exercise equity conversion rights prior to the loan s final maturity date 
our future working capital needs will depend upon the specific measures we pursue in the entitlement and development of our water resources and other development 
future capital expenditures will depend primarily on the progress of the water project 
 we will evaluate the amount of cash needed  and the manner in which such cash will be raised  on an ongoing basis 
we may meet any future cash requirements through a variety of means  including equity or debt placements  or through the sale or other disposition of assets 
equity placements would be undertaken only to the extent necessary  so as to minimize the dilutive effect of any such placements upon our existing stockholders 
limitations on our liquidity and ability to raise capital may adversely affect us 
sufficient liquidity is critical to meet our resource development activities 
although we currently expect our sources of capital to be sufficient to meet our near term liquidity needs  there can be no assurance that our liquidity requirements will continue to be satisfied 
if the company cannot raise needed funds  it might be forced to make substantial reductions in its operating expenses  which could adversely affect its abil ity to implement its current business plan and ultimately its viability as a company 
c critical accounting policies as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements of cadiz  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements based on all relevant information available at the time and giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policies described below 
however  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
management has concluded that the following critical accounting policies described below affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
intangible and other long lived assets 
property  plant and equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are depreciated or amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period over which the assets will generate revenue 
goodwill 
as a result of a merger in may between two companies  which eventually became known as cadiz inc  goodwill in the amount of  was recorded 
approximately  of this amount was amortized until the adoption of accounting standards codification  intangibles goodwill and other asc on january  valuation of goodwill and long lived asset 
the company assesses long lived assets  excluding goodwill  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
if it is determined that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable  the impairment is measured by using the projected discounted cash flow method 
the company reevaluates the carrying value of its water program annually 
the company tests goodwill for impairment annually as of december st  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate carrying values may not be recoverable  using the projected discounted cash flow method 
the company uses a two step impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any for the company 
the step calculation  used to identify potential impairment  compares the estimated fair value of the company to its net carrying value book values  including goodwill  on the measurement date 
if the fair value of the company is less than its carrying value  step of the impairment test is required to measure the amount of the impairment loss if any 
the step calculation of the impairment test compares the implied fair value of the goodwill to the carrying value of goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill represents the excess of the estimated fair value above the fair value of the company identified assets and liabilities 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess not to exceed the carrying value of goodwill 
the determination of the fair value of its assets and liabilities is performed as of the measurement date using observable market data before and after the measurement date if that subsequent information is relevant to the fair value on the measurement date 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowances 
to date  the company has not generated significant revenue from its water development programs  and it has a history of net operating losses 
as such  the company has generated significant deferred tax assets  including large net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income taxes for which it has recorded a full valuation allowance 
management is currently working on water storage  water supply  agriculture and solar energy development projects  including the water project  that are designed to generate future taxable income  although there can be no guarantee that this will occur 
if taxable income is generated in future years  some p ortion or all of the valuation allowance will be reversed  and an increase in net income would consequently be reported
