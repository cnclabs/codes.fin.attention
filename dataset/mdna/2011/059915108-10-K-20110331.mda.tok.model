overview and strategy our bank charter was approved in april and the bank opened for business on may  on july   the company became the bank holding company of the bank pursuant to a plan of acquisition that was approved by the boards of directors of the company and the bank and adopted by the shareholders of the bank at a special meeting held july  on june   the company s common stock was listed on a national stock exchange 
we currently operate a branch network and have received fdic and njdobi approval to open our seventh location 
our main office is located at palisade avenue  fort lee  nj and our current five additional offices are located at main street  fort lee  nj  hackensack avenue  hackensack  nj  west street  fort lee  nj  haworth avenue  haworth  nj and park street  harrington park  nj our seventh location will be located at grand avenue  englewood  nj and is expected to open during the summer of we conduct a traditional commercial banking business  accepting deposits from the general public  including individuals  businesses  non profit organizations  and governmental units 
we make commercial loans  consumer loans  and both residential and commercial real estate loans 
in addition  we provide other customer services and make investments in securities  as permitted by law 
we have sought to offer an alternative  community oriented style of banking in an area  which is presently dominated by larger  statewide and national financial institutions 
our focus remains on establishing and retaining customer relationships by offering a broad range of traditional financial services and products  competitively priced and delivered in a responsive manner to small businesses  professionals and individuals in the local market 
as a locally operated community bank  we believe we provide superior customer service that is highly personalized  efficient and responsive to local needs 
to better serve our customers and expand our market reach  we provide for the delivery of certain financial products and services to local customers and a broader market through the use of mail  telephone  internet  and electronic banking 
we endeavor to deliver these products and services with the care and professionalism expected of a community bank and with a special dedication to personalized customer service 
our specific objectives are to provide local businesses  professionals  and individuals with banking services responsive to and determined by the local market  direct access to bank management by members of the community  whether during or after business hours  to attract deposits and loans by competitive pricing  and to provide a reasonable return to shareholders on capital invested 

table of contents critical accounting policies and judgments our financial statements are prepared based on the application of certain accounting policies  the most significant of which are described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to the financial statements 
certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or subject to variation and may significantly affect our reported results and financial position for the period or in future periods 
the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when financial assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at  or adjusted to reflect  fair value 
assets carried at fair value inherently result in more financial statement volatility 
fair values and information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based on either quoted market prices or are provided by other independent third party sources  when available 
when such information is not available  management estimates valuation adjustments 
changes in underlying factors  assumptions  or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on our future financial condition and results of operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses alll represents our best estimate of losses known and inherent in our loan portfolio that are both probable and reasonable to estimate 
in determining the amount of the alll  we consider the losses inherent in our loan portfolio and changes in the nature and volume of our loan activities  along with general economic and real estate market conditions 
we utilize a segmented approach which identifies impaired loans for which specific reserves are established  classified loans for which a higher allowance is established  and performing loans for which a general valuation allowance is established 
we maintain a loan review system which provides for a systematic review of the loan portfolios and the early identification of impaired loans 
the review of residential real estate and home equity consumer loans  as well as other more complex loans  is triggered by identified evaluation factors  including delinquency status  size of loan  type of collateral and the financial condition of the borrower 
all commercial loans are evaluated individually for impairment 
specific loan loss allowances are established for impaired loans based on a review of such information and or appraisals of the underlying collateral 
general loan loss allowances are based upon a combination of factors including  but not limited to  actual loan loss experience  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions and management s judgment 
although specific and general loan loss allowances are established in accordance with management s best estimates  actual losses are dependent upon future events  and as such  further provisions for loan losses may be necessary in order to increase the level of the allowance for loan losses 
for example  our evaluation of the allowance includes consideration of current economic conditions  and a change in economic conditions could reduce the ability of borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans 
this could result in increased delinquencies and increased non performing loans  and thus a need to make increased provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
any such increase in provisions would result in a reduction to our earnings 
a change in economic conditions could also adversely affect the value of properties collateralizing real estate loans  resulting in increased charges against the allowance and reduced recoveries  and require increased provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
furthermore  a change in the composition  or growth  of our loan portfolio could result in the need for additional provisions 
at december  and  respectively  we consider the alll of  and  thousand adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
for further discussion  see provision for loan losses  loan portfolio  loan quality  and allowance for loan losses sections below in this discussion and analysis  as well as note summary of significant accounting policies and note loans and allowance for loan losses in the notes to financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowance deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the period in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period in which the change occurs 
deferred tax assets are reduced  through a valuation allowance  if necessary  by the amount of such benefits that are not expected to be realized based on current available evidence 

table of contents impairment of assets loans are considered impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due according to contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the collection of all amounts due according to contractual terms means both the contractual interest and principal payments of a loan will be collected as scheduled in the loan agreement 
impaired loans are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  except that as a practical expedient  a creditor may measure impairment based on a loan s observable market price  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the fair value of collateral  reduced by costs to sell on a discounted basis  is used if a loan is collateral dependent 
at december  and  the bank had seven impaired loans 
all of these loans have been measured for impairment using various measurement methods  including fair value of collateral 
periodically  we may need to assess whether there have been any events or economic circumstances to indicate that a security on which there is an unrealized loss is impaired on an other than temporary basis 
in any such instance  we would consider many factors including the severity and duration of the impairment  our intent to sell a debt security prior to recovery and or whether it is more likely than not we will have to sell the debt security prior to recovery 
securities on which there is an unrealized loss that is deemed to be other than temporary are written down to fair value with the write down recorded as a realized loss in securities gains losses 
the unrealized losses on two investments in u 
s 
treasury obligations and five government sponsored enterprise obligations were caused by interest rate increases 
the contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuer to settle the securities at a price less than the amortized cost basis of the investments 
because the company does not intended to sell the investments and it is not more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the investments before recovery of their amortized cost basis  which may be maturity  the company does not consider those investments to be other than temporarily impaired at december  all of the investments with unrealized losses at december  were in a loss position for less than twelve months 
at december  and  respectively  we did not have any other than temporary impaired securities 

table of contents results of operations versus the company s results of operations depend primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on its interest earning assets and the interest paid on and funds borrowed to support those assets  primarily deposits 
net interest margin is the net interest income expressed as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
net income is also affected by the amount of non interest income and non interest expenses  the provision for loan losses and income tax expense 
net income for the year ended december   net income increased by thousand  to  thousand from  thousand for the year ended december  the increase in net income for the year ended december  compared to was driven by an increase in the bank s net interest income 
the increase in net interest income is reflective of management s focus on earning assets and disciplined pricing which resulted in an increase in our net interest margin 
the increase in net interest income  which was primarily due to our increased net interest margin  more than offset the increased total other expenses 
on a per share basis  basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  were as compared to basic and diluted earnings per share of for the year ended december  analysis of net interest income net interest income represents the difference between income on interest earning assets and expense on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income depends upon the average volumes of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and yield earned or the interest paid on them 
for the year ended december   net interest income increased by million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  this increase in net interest income was primarily the result of a decrease in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  which decreased by basis points for as compared to  and an increase in loans of million  or

table of contents provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses represents our determination of the amount necessary to bring our allowance for loan losses to the level that we consider adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
see allowance for loan losses for additional information about our allowance for loan losses and our methodology for determining the amount of the allowance 
for the year ended december   the company s provision for loan losses was million  an increase of  from the provision of  for the year ended december  the increased provision is the result of the application of our allowance for loan losses methodology  and contributing factors such as the increase in the bank s loan portfolio of approximately million  as well as an increase in the bank s non performing assets 
non performing assets consist of non accruing loans  restructured loans and foreclosed assets 
at december   the bank had non performing assets of million as compared to million at december  non interest income non interest income  which consists primarily of service fees received from deposit accounts and gains on the sales of securities  for the year ended december   was  an increase of  from the  received during the year ended december  the increase in non interest income was primarily due to an increase in gains on the sales of securities of  non interest expenses non interest expenses for the year ended december  amounted to million  an increase of  or over the  for the year ended december  this increase was due in most part to increases in other real estate owned related expenses  salaries and employee benefits and professional fees which increased   and  respectively  for the year ended december   as compared to one year ago 
the increase in other real estate owned related expenses was the result of the bank s foreclosure of a residential property that had previously been reported as impaired  and the costs to get the property into a saleable condition 
salaries and employee benefits increased in part due to the opening and operating of the harrington park branch in the second quarter of  and therefore not included for the full year of income tax expense the income tax provision  which includes both federal and state taxes  for the years ended december  and was million and  respectively

loans our loan portfolio is the primary component of our assets 
total loans  which exclude net deferred fees and costs and the allowance for loan losses  increased by from million at december   to million at december  this growth in the loan portfolio continues to be primarily attributable to recommendations and referrals from members of our board of directors  our shareholders  our executive officers  and selective marketing by our management and staff 
we believe that we will continue to have opportunities for loan growth within the bergen county market of northern new jersey  due in part  to future consolidation of banking institutions within our market  which we expect to see as a result of increased regulatory standards  market pressures  and the overall economy 
we believe that it is not cost efficient for large institutions  many of which are headquartered out of state  to provide the level of personal service to small business borrowers that these customers seek and that we intend to provide 
our loan portfolio consists of commercial loans  real estate loans  consumer loans and credit lines 
commercial loans are made for the purpose of providing working capital  financing the purchase of equipment or inventory  as well as for other business purposes 
real estate loans consist of loans secured by commercial or residential real property and loans for the construction of commercial or residential property 
consumer loans including credit lines  are made for the purpose of financing the purchase of consumer goods  home improvements  and other personal needs  and are generally secured by the personal property being owned or being purchased 
our loans are primarily to businesses and individuals located in bergen county  new jersey 
we have not made loans to borrowers outside of the united states 
we have not made any sub prime loans 
commercial lending activities are focused primarily on lending to small business borrowers 
we believe that our strategy of customer service  competitive rate structures  and selective marketing have enabled us to gain market entry to local loans 
furthermore  we believe that bank mergers and lending restrictions at larger financial institutions with which we compete have also contributed to the success of our efforts to attract borrowers 
additionally  during this current economic climate  our capital position and safety has also become important to potential borrowers 

table of contents the following table sets forth the classification of the company s loans by major category as of december     and  respectively in thousands december  real estate commercial credit lines consumer total loans the following table sets forth the maturity of fixed and adjustable rate loans as of december  in thousands within to after one year years years total loans with fixed rate commercial real estate credit lines consumer loans with adjustable rate commercial real estate credit lines consumer loan quality as mentioned above  our principal assets are our loans 
inherent in the lending function is the risk of the borrower s inability to repay a loan under its existing terms 
risk elements include non accrual loans  past due and restructured loans  potential problem loans  loan concentrations  and other real estate owned 
non performing assets include loans that are not accruing interest non accrual loans as a result of principal or interest being in default for a period of days or more and accruing loans that are days past due  restructured loans and foreclosed assets 
when a loan is classified as non accrual  interest accruals discontinue and all past due interest  including interest applicable to prior years  is reversed and charged against current income 
until the loan becomes current  any payments received from the borrower are applied to outstanding principal until such time as management determines that the financial condition of the borrower and other factors merit recognition of such payments of interest 
we attempt to minimize overall credit risk through loan diversification and our loan underwriting and approval procedures 
due diligence begins at the time we begin to discuss the origination of a loan with a borrower 
documentation  including a borrower s credit history  materials establishing the value and liquidity of potential collateral  the purpose of the loan  the source and timing of the repayment of the loan  and other factors are analyzed before a loan is submitted for approval 
loans made are also subject to periodic audit and review 

table of contents at december   the bank had six non accrual loans totaling approximately million  of which three loans totaling thousand had specific reserves of thousand and three loans totaling approximately million had no specific reserves 
the bank recognized income of thousand on these loans in if interest had been accrued  such income would have been approximately thousand 
these loans were considered impaired at december   and were evaluated in accordance with asc sub topic  troubled debt restructurings by creditors 
after evaluation  specific reserves of thousand were deemed necessary at december  at december   there were seven non accruing loans totaling approximately million 
the bank recognized income of thousand on these loans in if interest had been accrued  such interest would have been approximately thousand 
these loans were considered impaired at december   and were evaluated in accordance with asc sub topic after evaluation  a specific reserve of thousand was deemed necessary 
at december   and  respectively  the bank had no non accruing loans 
at december   the bank had three residential mortgage loans that met the definition of a troubled debt restructuring tdr loan 
tdrs are loans where modifications could include a reduction in the interest rate of the loan  payment extensions  forgiveness of principal or other actions to maximize collection 
at december   tdr loans had an aggregate outstanding balance of million with specific reserves of approximately thousand 
two of the tdrs  with an aggregate outstanding balance at december  of thousand and a specific reserve of thousand are included in the bank s impaired loan totals 
during the third quarter of  two loans reported as impaired in the previous quarter  which approximated thousand  and which were fully reserved  were charged off 
a third loan  a single family residential loan with a net value of approximately million  was foreclosed on and placed in other real estate owned 
this event caused a charge off of approximately thousand during the period 
at december    and  respectively  there were no tdrs or loans past due more than days and still accruing interest 
the bank maintains an external independent loan review auditor 
the loan review auditor performs periodic examinations of a sample of commercial loans after the bank has extended credit 
this review process is intended to identify adverse developments in individual credits  regardless of payment history 
the loan review auditor also monitors the integrity of our credit risk rating system 
the loan review auditor reports directly to the audit committee of our board of directors and provides the audit committee with reports on asset quality 
the loan review audit reports may be presented to our board of directors by the audit committee for review  as appropriate 
allowance for loan losses the alll represents a critical accounting policy 
the allowance is a reserve established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses 
we maintain an alll which we believe is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
while we apply the methodology discussed below in connection with the establishment of our alll  it is subject to critical judgments on the part of management 
loan losses are charged directly to the allowance when they are judged to be uncollectable and any recovery is credited to the allowance 
risks within the loan portfolio are analyzed on a continuous basis by our officers  by external independent loan review function  and by our audit committee 
a risk system  consisting of multiple grading categories  is utilized as an analytical tool to assess risk and appropriate reserves 
in addition to the risk system  management further evaluates risk characteristics of the loan portfolio under current and anticipated economic conditions and considers such factors as the financial condition of the borrower  past and expected loss experience  and other factors which management feels deserve recognition in establishing an appropriate reserve 
these estimates are reviewed at least quarterly  and  as adjustments become necessary  they are realized in the periods in which they become known 
additions to the allowance are made by provisions charged to earnings and the allowance is reduced by net charge offs  which are loans judged to be uncollectible  less any recoveries on loans previously charged off 
although management attempts to maintain the allowance at an adequate level  future additions to the allowance may be required due to the growth of our loan portfolio  changes in asset quality  changes in market conditions and other factors 
additionally  various regulatory agencies  primarily the fdic  periodically review our alll 
these agencies may require additional provisions based upon their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination 
although management uses what it believes to be the best information available  the level of the alll remains an estimate which is subject to significant judgment and short term change 

table of contents we commenced banking operations in may   and our alll totaled   and  respectively  at december    and the growth of the allowance is primarily due to the growth and composition of the loan portfolio

we evaluate the adequacy of the alll by performing periodic  systematic reviews of the loan portfolio 
while allocations are made to specific loans and pools of loans  the total allowance is available for any loan losses 
although the alll is our best estimate of the inherent loan losses as of the balance sheet date  the process of determining the adequacy of the alll is judgmental and subject to changes in external conditions 
accordingly  existing levels of the alll may ultimately prove inadequate to absorb actual loan losses 
however  we have determined  and believe  that the alll is at a level adequate to absorb the probable loan losses in our loan portfolio as of the balance sheet dates 

table of contents investment securities in addition to our loan portfolio  we maintain an investment portfolio which is available to fund increased loan demand or deposit withdrawals and other liquidity needs  and which provides an additional source of interest income

securities are classified as held to maturity  referred to as htm  trading  or available for sale  referred to as afs  at the time of purchase 
securities are classified as htm if management intends and we have the ability to hold them to maturity 
such securities are stated at cost  adjusted for unamortized purchase premiums and discounts 
securities which are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term are classified as trading securities  which are carried at market value 
realized gains and losses  as well as gains and losses from marking trading securities to market value  are included in trading revenue

table of contents during  the company sold three securities from its afs portfolio and recognized gains of  from the transactions 
deposits deposits are our primary source of funds 
we experienced a growth of million  or  in deposits from million at december  to million at december  this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in our time deposit accounts which we believe reflects our competitive rate structure and the public perception of our safety and soundness 
during this interest rate environment  our attractive time deposit products have allowed the bank to increase its overall deposits while still being able to reduce its overall cost of deposits and thereby increasing its net interest income 
the increase is also attributable to the continued referrals of our board of directors  stockholders  management  and staff 
the company has no foreign deposits  nor are there any material concentrations of deposits

our principal sources of funds are deposits  scheduled amortization and prepayments of loan principal  maturities of investment securities  and funds provided by operations 
while scheduled loan payments and maturing investments are relatively predictable sources of funds  deposit flow and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions  and competition 
in addition  if warranted  we would be able to borrow funds 

table of contents our total deposits equaled  and  respectively  at december  and the growth in funds provided by deposit inflows during this period coupled with our cash position at the end of has been sufficient to provide for our loan demand 
through the investment portfolio  we have generally sought to obtain a safe  yet slightly higher yield than would have been available to us as a net seller of overnight federal funds  while still maintaining liquidity 
through our investment portfolio  we also attempt to manage our maturity gap by seeking maturities of investments which coincide as closely as possible with maturities of deposits 
securities available for sale would also be available to provide liquidity for anticipated loan demand and liquidity needs 
although we were a net seller of federal funds at december   we have a million overnight line of credit facility available with first tennessee bank and a million overnight line of credit with atlantic central bankers bank for the purchase of federal funds in the event that temporary liquidity needs arise 
at december   the bank had no borrowed funds outstanding 
we are an approved member of the federal home loan bank of new york  or fhlbny 
the fhlbny relationship could provide additional sources of liquidity  if required 
we believe that our current sources of funds provide adequate liquidity for our current cash flow needs 
interest rate sensitivity analysis we manage our assets and liabilities with the objectives of evaluating the interest rate risk included in certain balance sheet accounts  determining the level of risk appropriate given our business focus  operating environment  capital and liquidity requirements  establishing prudent asset concentration guidelines  and managing risk consistent with guidelines approved by our board of directors 
we seek to reduce the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates and to manage the ratio of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities within specified maturities or re pricing dates 
our actions in this regard are taken under the guidance of the asset liability committee of our board of directors  or alco 
alco generally reviews our liquidity  cash flow needs  maturities of investments  deposits and borrowings  and current market conditions and interest rates 
one of the monitoring tools used by alco is an analysis of the extent to which assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and measures our interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or re price within that time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
accordingly  during a period of rising rates  a negative gap may result in the yield on assets increasing at a slower rate than the increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  resulting in a decrease in net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  an institution with a negative gap would experience a re pricing of its assets at a slower rate than its interest bearing liabilities which  consequently  may result in its net interest income growing 

table of contents the following table sets forth the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at the periods indicated which we anticipated  based upon certain assumptions  will re price or mature in each of the future time periods presented 
except as noted  the amount of assets and liabilities which re price or mature during a particular period were determined in accordance with the earlier of the term to re pricing or the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
because we have no interest bearing liabilities with a maturity greater than five years  we believe that a static gap for the over five year time period reflects an accurate assessment of interest rate risk 
our loan maturity assumptions are based upon actual maturities within the loan portfolio 
equity securities have been included in other assets as they are not interest rate sensitive

table of contents market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in our lending and deposit taking activities 
thus  we actively monitor and manage our interest rate risk exposure 
our profitability is affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
a sudden and substantial increase or decrease in interest rates may adversely impact our earnings to the extent that the interest rates borne by assets and liabilities do not change at the same speed  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we monitor the impact of changing interest rates on our net interest income using several tools 
one measure of our exposure to differential changes in interest rates between assets and liabilities is shown in our cumulative rate sensitive balance sheet under the interest rate sensitivity analysis caption in this discussion and analysis 
in the future  we may use additional analyses  including periodic shock analysis to evaluate the effect of interest rates upon our operations and our financial condition and to manage our exposure to interest rate risk 
our primary objective in managing interest rate risk is to minimize the adverse impact of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and capital  while structuring our asset liability structure to obtain the maximum yield cost spread on that structure
