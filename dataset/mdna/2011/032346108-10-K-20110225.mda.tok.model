item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biopharmaceutical company committed to improving the lives of people with diabetes  obesity and other metabolic diseases through the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative medicines 
we are marketing two first in class medicines to treat diabetes  both launched in  byetta exenatide injection and symlin pramlintide acetate injection and we are currently seeking approval for bydureon exenatide extended release for injectable suspension  an investigational sustained release medication for type diabetes that is administered only once a week 
in and early  we executed on key initiatives for the company including initiated the required thorough qt  or tqt  study to support the regulatory application for bydureon and expect to submit our response to the united states food and drug administration  or fda  second bydureon complete response letter in the second half of  submitted a supplemental new drug application  or snda  to the fda for the expanded use of byetta as an add on therapy to basal insulin  submitted the initial sections of a rolling submission for a biologics license application  or bla  to the fda for the use of metreleptin to treat diabetes and or hypertriglyceridemia high levels of triglycerides in the bloodstream in patients with rare forms of lipodystrophy  announced results from duration  a head to head study that compared bydureon monotherapy to januvia sitagliptin  actos pioglitazone hci or metformin 
results demonstrated that bydureon efficacy and tolerability profile extended to monotherapy treatment  initiated our duration clinical study  a head to head comparison of bydureon to victoza liraglutide  a glucaon like peptide analog  with results expected in the first half of  initiated our exscel exenatide study of cardiovascular event lowering cardiovascular outcomes study for bydureon  with results expected in  and announced  with our partner takeda pharmaceuticals  inc or takeda  that we will advance the combination treatment of pramlintide metreleptin for obesity toward phase development 
byetta is the first approved medicine in a class of compounds called glucagon like peptide glp receptor agonists 
it is approved as a first line  stand alone medication monotherapy along with diet and exercise to improve glycemic control in adults with type diabetes 
byetta is also approved as an adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in patients with type diabetes who have not achieved adequate glycemic control by using metformin  a sulfonylurea and or a thiazolidinediene tzd  three common oral therapies for type diabetes 
we recently submitted a snda to the fda for expanded use of byetta as an add on to basal insulin and expect a response from the fda in net product sales of byetta were million in  million in and million in we have an agreement with our partner eli lilly and company  or lilly  for the global development and commercialization of exenatide 
this agreement includes byetta and other formulations of exenatide such as bydureon 
under the terms of the agreement  operating profits from products sold in the united states are shared equally between lilly and us  and lilly will pay us royalties for product sales outside of the united states 
lilly co promotes byetta in the united states and has primary responsibility for developing and commercializing byetta outside of the united states  including any sustained release formulations of exenatide such as bydureon 
by the end of  byetta was commercially launched in approximately countries worldwide 
symlin is the first and only approved medicine in a class of compounds called amylinomimetics 
it is approved as an adjunctive therapy to improve glycemic control in patients with either type or type diabetes who are treated with mealtime insulin but who have not achieved adequate glycemic control 
we own of the global rights to symlin  which had net product sales of million in  million in and million in we have a field force of approximately people dedicated to marketing byetta and symlin in the united states 
our field force includes our specialty sales force and our managed care organization which brings a specialty approach to endocrinologists and diabetes focused primary care physicians and is focused on targeting those doctors that write the majority of prescriptions for branded diabetes therapies 
in addition to our marketed products  we are working with lilly and alkermes  inc  or alkermes  to develop bydureon 
in may  we submitted an nda for bydureon to the fda and in march we received a complete response letter from the fda regarding the nda 
the key components of the complete response letter related primarily to finalization of product labeling with an accompanying risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems  and clarification of proprietary manufacturing processes 
the complete response letter did not contain any requests for additional pre clinical or clinical trials 
we filed our response to the complete response letter in april and in may the fda notified us that they had assigned a new prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  target action date of october  on october   we received a second complete response letter from the fda for bydureon in which the agency requested a tqt study designed to evaluate exposures of exenatide higher than typical therapeutic levels of bydureon 
a tqt study is intended to determine whether a drug has an adverse pharmacologic effect on cardiac repolarization  as detected by qt qtc prolongation 
in january  we received written feedback from the fda indicating approval of the tqt study design and initiated the study in february in addition  the fda has requested the results of our duration study  a head to head study comparing bydureon to byetta that was completed in the fourth quarter of  to evaluate the efficacy  and the labeling of the safety and effectiveness of the commercial formulation of bydureon 
our goal is to complete the tqt study and submit a reply to the fda second complete response letter in the second half of based on the requirements for additional data  we believe this will likely be considered a class resubmission requiring a six month fda review 
in  we will continue our efforts to expand the indication for byetta and target new market segments for this product 
we also plan to work toward increasing patient awareness and adherence of symlin 
we continue to work with the fda to gain approval for bydureon and plan to submit our response to the fda second complete response letter in the second half of we will also continue to focus on building a superior profile for bydureon by completing an additional clinical trial that will compare bydureon with victoza with results of this study expected in the first half of in addition  we have initiated our exscel study to demonstrate bydureon effect on cardiovascular endpoints with results of this study expected in we also plan to continue making strategic investments in the exenatide franchise including the development of a bydureon pen delivery system and an exenatide suspension formulation that could enable monthly administration of exenatide 
our long term growth strategy is focused on making prudent investment decisions based on strong clinical data to advance our obesity program including the development of pramlintide metreleptin  a combination therapy for the treatment of obesity which we and our obesity partner  takeda  are advancing toward phase development 
we are also developing metreleptin as a treatment for lipodystrophy  a very rare metabolic condition 
we plan to submit the chemistry  manufacturing and controls section of the bla to the fda by the end of because severe lipodystrophy affects a very small number of patients  metreleptin for the treatment for lipodystrophy has received orphan drug designation by the fda 
with this fast track and priority review designation  we believe that metreleptin could be available to lipodystrophy patients as soon as we maintain an active discovery research program focused on novel peptide and protein therapeutics 
we have also entered into a number of strategic alliances and business initiatives that support our expansion into new therapeutic areas  including our strategic relationship with biocon  limited  or biocon  to develop pharmaceutical products  including ac  which comes from our phybrid technology platform 
we and biocon plan to submit an investigational new drug application  or ind  and commence a phase study for ac by the end of since our inception in september  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to our research and development programs and  more recently  to the commercialization of our products 
all of our revenues prior to may were derived from milestones and amortization of up front payments under our exenatide collaboration agreement with lilly  previous symlin collaborative agreements  and previous co promotion agreements 
during the second quarter of  we began to derive revenues from product sales of byetta and symlin 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately billion 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million of restricted cash 
additionally we have million available to us pursuant to a credit facility with lilly 
although we have yet to consistently generate positive operating cash flows  we intend to continue to improve our operating results and reduce our use of cash for operating activities in compared to refer to the discussions under the headings liquidity and capital resources below and cautionary factors that may affect future results in part i  item a for further discussion regarding our anticipated future capital requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation  inventory costs  research and development expenses and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements see note to our consolidated financial statements on page f 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products  license fees and milestones as earned 
net product sales we sell byetta and symlin primarily to wholesale distributors  who in turn  sell to retail pharmacies and government entities 
decisions made by these wholesalers and their customers regarding the levels of inventory they hold  and thus the amount of byetta and symlin they purchase  may materially affect the level of our product sales in any particular period 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when delivery has occurred  title has transferred to the customer  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and we have no further obligations 
we record product sales net of allowances for product returns  rebates and wholesaler chargebacks  wholesaler discounts and prescription vouchers 
we are required to make significant judgments and estimates in determining some of these allowances 
if actual results differ from our estimates  we will be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future 
product returns we do not offer our wholesale customers a general right of return 
however  we will accept returns of products that are damaged or defective when received by the wholesale customer or for any unopened product during the period beginning six months prior to and up to months subsequent to its expiration date 
product returned is generally not resalable as our products require refrigeration 
we refund the sales price for product returns in cash or credit to our customers 
we estimate product returns based on our historical returns experience and record an allowance for estimated returns at the time of sale 
additionally  we consider several other factors in our estimation process including our internal sales forecasts  the expiration dates of product shipped and third party data to assist us in monitoring estimated channel inventory levels and prescription trends 
actual returns could exceed our historical experience and our estimates of expected future returns due to factors such as wholesaler and retailer stocking patterns and inventory levels and or competitive changes 
to date actual returns have not differed materially from our estimates 
rebates and wholesaler chargebacks allowances for rebates include mandated discounts under the medicaid drug rebate program and contracted discounts with commercial payors 
rebates are amounts owed after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant and are based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector and public sector eg medicaid benefit providers 
the allowance for rebates is based on contractual discount rates  expected utilization under each contract and our estimate of the amount of inventory in the distribution channel that will become subject to such rebates 
our estimates for expected utilization for rebates are based on historical rebate claims and to a lesser extent third party market research data 
rebates are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
wholesaler chargebacks are discounts that occur when contracted customers purchase directly from an intermediary wholesale purchaser 
contracted customers  which currently consist primarily of federal government entities purchasing off the federal supply schedule  generally purchase the product at its contracted price  plus a mark up from the wholesaler 
the wholesaler  in turn  charges back to us the difference between the price initially paid by the wholesaler and the contracted price paid to the wholesaler by the customer 
the allowance for wholesaler chargebacks is based on expected utilization of these programs and reported wholesaler inventory levels 
actual rebates and wholesaler chargebacks could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future participation in these programs 
to date  actual rebate claims and wholesaler chargebacks have not differed materially from our estimates 
wholesaler discounts wholesaler discounts consist of prompt payment discounts and distribution service fees 
we offer all of our wholesale customers a prompt pay discount within the first days after the date of the invoice 
distribution service fees arise from contractual agreements with certain of our wholesale customers for distribution services they provide to us and are generally a fixed percentage of their purchases of our products in a given period 
prompt payment discounts and distribution service fees are recorded as a reduction to gross sales in the period the sales occur 
the allowance for wholesaler discounts is based upon actual data of product sales to wholesale customers and not on estimates 
prescription vouchers prescription vouchers result in amounts owed to pharmacies that have redeemed vouchers for a free prescription 
we provide prescription vouchers to physicians  who in turn distribute them to patients 
patients may redeem a voucher at a pharmacy for a free prescription 
we reimburse the pharmacy for the price it paid the wholesaler for the medicine and record this reimbursement as a reduction to gross sales 
the allowance for prescription vouchers is based on the number of unredeemed vouchers in circulation  and the estimated utilization rate 
the estimated utilization rate is based on our historical utilization rates experience with prescription vouchers 
the allowance for prescription vouchers could exceed historical experience and our estimates of future utilization rates 
to date  actual prescription voucher utilization has not differed materially from our estimates 
revenues under collaborative agreements revenues under collaborative agreements consist of the amortization of product and technology license fees and milestone payments earned 
upfront product and technology license fees under multiple element arrangements are deferred and recognized over the period of such services or performance if such arrangements require on going services or performance 
non refundable amounts received for substantive milestones are recognized upon achievement of the milestone 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
valuation of stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation to employees in accordance with the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation arrangements which requires us to expense the estimated fair value of non cash  stock based payments to employees 
we estimate the fair value of stock based payments to employees using the black scholes model 
this estimate is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of inputs that require us to make significant estimates and judgments 
these inputs include the expected volatility of our stock price  the expected term of employee stock options  the risk free interest rate  expected dividends and expected forfeiture rate 
we estimate volatility based upon the historical volatility of our common stock for a period corresponding to the expected term of our employee stock options and the implied volatility of market traded options on our common stock with various maturities between six months and two years 
the determination to use implied volatility in addition to historical volatility was based upon the availability of data related to actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that the addition of implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility alone 
the expected life of our employee stock options represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding in consideration of historical exercise patterns and the assumption that all outstanding options will be exercised at the mid point of the then current date and their maximum contractual term 
the risk free interest rates are based on the yield curve of united states treasury strip securities in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of our employee stock options 
we have never paid dividends and do not anticipate doing so for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we have assumed no dividend yield for purposes of estimating the fair value of our stock based payments to employees 
stock based compensation expense recognized is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and therefore is reduced by expected forfeitures 
we estimate forfeitures based upon historical forfeiture rates  and will adjust our estimate of forfeitures if actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from such estimates 
changes in estimated forfeitures will be recognized through a cumulative adjustment in the period of the change and will also impact the amount of stock based compensation expense in future periods 
if factors underlying the above assumptions change in future periods  the associated estimated non cash  stock based compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
research and development expenses research and development costs are expensed as incurred and include salaries  benefits  bonus  stock based compensation  license fees  milestone payments due under license agreements  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  and develop drug materials and delivery devices  and associated overhead and facilities costs 
reimbursed research and development costs under collaborative arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses and are recognized in the period in which the related costs are incurred 
clinical trial costs are a significant component of research and development expenses and include costs associated with third party contractors 
invoicing from third party contractors for services performed can lag several months 
we accrue the costs of services rendered in connection with third party contractor activities based on our estimate of management fees  site management and monitoring costs and data management costs 
differences between actual clinical trial costs from estimated clinical trial costs have historically not been material and are adjusted for in the period in which they become known 
income taxes we have net deferred tax assets relating primarily to net operating loss carryforwards and research and development tax credit carryforwards 
subject to certain limitations  these deferred tax assets may be used to offset taxable income in future periods 
since we have been unprofitable since inception and the likelihood of future profitability is not assured  we have established a valuation allowance for most of these net deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets at december  and if we determine that we are able to realize a portion or all of these deferred tax assets in the future  we will record an adjustment to increase their recorded value and a corresponding adjustment to increase income or additional paid in capital  as appropriate  in that same period 
we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
we provide estimates for unrecognized tax benefits which relate primarily to issues common among corporations in our industry 
we apply a variety of methodologies in making these estimates which include advice from industry and subject experts  evaluation of public actions taken by the internal revenue service and other taxing authorities  as well as our own industry experience 
if our estimates are not representative of actual outcomes  our results could be materially impacted 
inventories and related reserves inventories consist of raw materials  work in process and finished goods for symlin and byetta 
we maintain inventory reserves primarily for production failures and potential product expiration 
the manufacturing processes for our products are complex 
deviations in the manufacturing process may result in production failures and additional inventory reserves 
obsolete inventory due to expiration may also result in additional inventory reserves 
in estimating inventory obsolescence reserves  we analyze the shelf life  expiration dates and internal sales forecasts  each on a product by product basis 
we expense costs relating to the purchase and production of pre approval inventories for which the sole use is pre approval products as research and development expense in the period incurred until such time as we believe future commercialization is probable and future economic benefit is expected to be recognized 
with respect to capitalization of unapproved product candidates  we produce inventory in preparation for the launch of the product and in amounts sufficient to support forecasted initial market demand 
typically  capitalization of such inventory does not begin until the product candidate is considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval 
this generally will occur only after we have submitted an nda to the fda  and only if our assessment of the status of the regulatory review has led us to conclude there is a high probability of receiving regulatory approval 
if we are aware of any specific risks or contingencies that are likely to impact the regulatory approval process or if there are any specific issues identified during our research and development process relating to safety  efficacy or manufacturing of the product candidate  we would not capitalize the related inventory 
we manage the levels of inventory at each stage of the manufacturing process to optimize the shelf life of the inventory and avoid product expiration issues relative to anticipated market demand following launch 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate all inventory  including inventory capitalized for which regulatory approval has not yet been obtained  to determine if any lower of cost or market adjustment is required 
as our evaluation relates to pre approval inventory  we consider several factors including expected timing of fda approval  projected sales volume  expiration dates of the inventory and estimated selling price 
projected sales volume is based on several factors including market research  sales of similar products and competition in the market 
estimated sales price is based on the price of existing products sold for the same indications  market research and expected market demand 
once we have capitalized inventory for a product candidate that is not yet approved  we will monitor  on a quarterly basis  the status of such candidate within the regulatory approval process 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory upon a change in our judgment of future commercialization and future economic benefit expected to be recognized  due to a denial or delay of approval by the fda  a delay in the timeline for commercialization or other potential factors 
convertible senior notes during  we adopted new authoritative guidance that significantly impacts the accounting for our convertible senior notes issued in june by requiring us to account separately for the liability and equity components of the notes 
the liability component is measured so the effective interest expense associated with the notes reflects the issuer borrowing rate at the date of issuance for similar debt instruments without the conversion feature 
the difference between the cash proceeds associated with the notes and this estimated fair value is recorded as a debt discount and amortized to interest expense over the life of the notes 
determining the fair value of the liability component requires the use of accounting estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are judgmental in nature and could have a significant impact on the determination of the liability component and  in effect  the associated interest expense 
according to the guidance  the carrying amount of the liability component is determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component 
if no similar liabilities exist  estimates of fair value are primarily determined using assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the liability component  including market interest rates  credit standing  yield curves and volatilities 
recently issued accounting pronouncements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements  refer to the section titled recently issued accounting standards within note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net product sales net product sales for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively  and consisted of sales of byetta and symlin  less allowances for product returns  rebates and wholesaler chargebacks  wholesaler discounts  and prescription vouchers 
the following table provides information regarding net product sales in millions year ended december  byetta symlin the decrease in net product sales for byetta for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily reflects reduced prescription demand due to new entrants to the market  partially offset by higher prices 
the decrease in net product sales for byetta for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily reflects decreased prescription demand following an august fda update on a prior alert referencing pancreatitis and an allowance for rebates related to the us department of defense dod tricare retail pharmacy program discussed below 
these decreases are partially offset by higher prices in the year ended december  compared to the same period in the increase in net product sales for symlin for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily reflects higher prices  partially offset by reduced prescription demand 
the slight decrease in net product sales for symlin for the year ended december  compared to the same period in primarily reflects higher prices offset by a reserve for the dod tricare retail pharmacy program  discussed below  and a reduction in prescription demand 
in a final rule related to the dod tricare retail pharmacy program was issued clarifying the dod interpretation of the national defense authorization act of  or ndaa 
the final rule changed the process by which rebate obligations for the tricare retail pharmacy program are created such that a contractual agreement is no longer required and that obligation to pay such rebates emanates from the ndaa itself 
in consideration of this final rule we recorded allowances of million and million for such rebates for the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in the million allowance recorded in is million which represents a retroactive rebate assessment for sales made during sales of our products in future periods may be impacted by numerous factors  including potential competition  the potential approval of additional products including bydureon  regulatory matters  economic factors and other environmental factors 
revenues under collaborative agreements the following table summarizes the components of revenues under collaborative agreements for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  amortization of up front payments recognition of milestone payments amortization of up front payments increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period of due primarily to amounts earned pursuant to our obesity collaboration with takeda 
for the year ended december   amortization of up front payments consists entirely of amounts earned pursuant to our obesity collaboration with takeda  while amortization of up front payments for the year ended december  consists of amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration with lilly  for which amortization ended in  and our collaboration with takeda  for which amortization began in late during the year ended december  amortization of up front payments consists of amounts earned pursuant to our collaboration with lilly 
milestone payments for the year ended december  consisted primarily of a million milestone earned as a result of lilly launch of byetta in japan in late there were no milestone payments in or in future periods  we expect that revenues under collaborative agreements will consist of continued amortization of the million up front payment received from takeda upon signing of our collaboration agreement in this up front payment is being amortized ratably over a ten year period representing the estimated development period of the compounds subject to the takeda collaboration agreement 
additionally  beginning in we expect to begin to earn royalties on product sales of byetta and or bydureon  if approved  outside of the united states 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was million  representing a gross margin of  million  representing a gross margin of  and million  representing a gross margin of  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cost of goods sold is comprised primarily of manufacturing costs associated with byetta and symlin sales during the period 
the increase in gross margin in  as compared to  primarily reflects higher net sales prices partially offset by slightly higher per unit costs 
the increase in gross margin in  as compared to  primarily reflects higher net sales prices and lower unit costs for byetta driven by reduced inventory reserves and efficiencies driven by our reduced cost structure 
annual fluctuations in gross margins may be influenced by production volumes  product mix  pricing and the level of sales allowances 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease in compared to primarily reflects lower sales force and business infrastructure expenses following a restructuring of our sales force  and continued efforts to drive efficiencies in our cost structure 
the million decrease in compared to reflects our reduced cost structure following restructurings that occurred in late and in mid we  along with lilly  are jointly responsible for the co promotion of byetta within the united states  and share equally in sales force costs and external marketing expenses 
accordingly  amounts due to or from lilly related to sharing of these expenses are reflected as an increase to or a reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses  as appropriate 
research and development expenses currently  our research and development efforts are focused on programs for the treatment of diabetes and obesity in various stages of development 
the drug development process in the united states includes a series of steps defined by the fda 
the process begins with discovery and preclinical evaluation leading up to the submission of an ind to the fda  which allows for the initiation of the clinical evaluation of a potential drug candidate in humans 
clinical evaluation is typically comprised of three phases of study phase  phase and phase generally  the majority of a drug candidate total development costs are incurred during phase  which consists of trials that are typically both the longest and largest conducted during the drug development process 
successful completion of phase clinical testing is followed by the submission of an nda to the fda for marketing approval 
it is not uncommon for the fda to request additional data following its review of an nda  which can significantly increase the drug development timeline and expenses 
following initial regulatory approval for a drug candidate  companies generally initiate additional clinical trials aimed at expanding product labeling and market potential 
the timing and costs to complete the successful development of any of our drug candidates are highly uncertain  and therefore difficult to estimate 
our research and development costs are comprised of salaries and bonuses  benefits  non cash stock based compensation  license fees  milestones under license agreements  costs paid to third party contractors to perform research  conduct clinical trials  and develop drug materials and delivery devices  and associated overhead expenses and facilities costs 
reimbursed research and development costs under collaborative arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development costs 
we charge direct internal and external program costs to the respective development programs 
we also incur indirect costs that are not allocated to specific programs because such costs benefit multiple development programs and allow us to increase our pharmaceutical development capabilities 
these consist primarily of facilities costs and other internal shared resources related to the development and maintenance of systems and processes applicable to all of our programs 
the following table sets forth information regarding our research and development expenses for our major projects for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  diabetes obesity research and early stage programs indirect costs research and development expenses for the years ended december  and have been revised to conform with the current presentation 
research and development expenses for our diabetes program consist primarily of costs associated with byetta and bydureon which are shared by lilly pursuant to our collaboration agreement 
cost sharing payments received from lilly are recorded as a reduction to research and development and were million  million and million for the years ended december   and research and development expenses for our obesity program include costs associated with our collaboration agreement with takeda 
cost sharing payments received from takeda are recorded as a reduction to research and development and were million  million and for the years ended december   and research and development expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million decrease primarily reflects decreased development expenses for our obesity programs  driven by development expense cost sharing with takeda 
the decrease in obesity development expenses is partially offset by increased bydureon expenses associated with manufacturing readiness  a cardiovascular outcomes study and development activities for the exenatide suspension formulation 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the million decrease primarily reflects our reduced cost structure and decreased development expenses for our obesity programs following recently completed clinical trials  partially offset by increased costs for our diabetes programs associated with manufacturing readiness activities at our ohio manufacturing facility for bydureon 
collaborative profit sharing collaborative profit sharing was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  and consists of lilly share of the gross margin for byetta sales in the united states 
restructuring during the year ended december  we reduced our workforce by approximately employees  or the restructuring  and recorded restructuring charges of million consisting of employee separation costs  facilities related charges  asset impairment charges and other direct incremental charges 
in  we announced a restructuring of our sales force to merge our existing primary care and specialty sales forces into a single organization  or the restructuring 
the restructuring reduced the total number of amylin sales representatives by approximately employees 
we recorded restructuring charges of million during the year ended december  consisting of employee separation costs and facilities related charges 
in  we announced a strategic restructuring and workforce reduction  or the restructuring  that reduced the size of our san diego workforce by approximately  or employees 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded restructuring charges of million which are comprised of employee separation costs  facility related charges  asset impairment charges and other direct incremental charges 
the facilities related charges recorded in each of the three years ended december  consist of expenses related to facility leases for exited facilities  including impairments of related tenant improvements 
the following table sets forth the components of the restructuring charges recognized for the years ended december   and in millions year ended december  facility related charges employee separation costs asset impairments other restructuring charges we have substantially completed all of the above activities included in the restructuring plan and all costs associated with the restructurings were incurred during the years ended december   and interest and other expense  net the following table provides information regarding our interest and other expense  net in millions year ended december  interest and other income interest and other expense loss on impairment of investments total interest and other expense  net interest and other income consist primarily of interest income from investment of cash and investments 
the decrease in compared to primarily reflects lower average investment balances and lower interest rates in as compared to the decrease in compared to primarily reflects lower average investment balances and lower interest rates in compared to interest and other expense consist primarily of interest expense resulting from our long term debt obligations and mark to market gains and losses on derivative financial instrument and include interest payments and the amortization of debt issuance costs 
the increase in compared to primarily reflects a decrease in interest capitalized on our ohio manufacturing facility in the decrease in compared to primarily reflects an increase in interest capitalized to our ohio manufacturing facility and mark to market gains on derivative financial instruments which  in  were mark to market losses 
we recognized a loss on impairment of investments of million for the year ended december  the loss represents credit related losses associated with one security in our portfolio and was based upon the amortized cost basis and the observed market prices for the security 
at december   gross unrealized losses on our short term investments were million  all of which we determined to be temporary 
we recognized a loss on impairment of investments of million for the year ended december  the loss represents credit related losses associated with two securities in our portfolio and was based upon the amortized cost basis and the observed market prices for the securities 
we recognized a loss on impairment of investments of million for the year ended december  this primarily represents a recognized million other than temporary impairment loss on an equity investment in a privately held entity based upon our assessment of the entity financial and technical performance and the entity ability to raise additional capital in significantly deteriorated financial markets to fund ongoing operations 
during the year ended december  we also recognized a million other than temporary impairment loss on a corporate debt security in our investment portfolio based upon our assessment of the impact of bankruptcy proceedings of the issuer on the recoverability of our investment 
net loss our net loss for the year ended december  was million compared to million in and million in the decrease in our net loss in compared to primarily reflects the decreased expenses partially offset by the decreased net product sales discussed above 
the decrease in our net loss in compared to primarily reflects the decreased expenses discussed above 
we may incur operating losses for the next few years 
our ability to reach profitability in the future will be heavily dependent upon the amount of product sales that we achieve for byetta  symlin and bydureon  if approved 
our ability to achieve profitability in the future will also depend on our ability to control our operating expenses  including ongoing expenses associated with the continued commercialization of byetta and symlin  costs associated with the development and commercialization of bydureon  if approved  and expenses associated with our research and development programs  including our obesity and our early stage development programs and related support infrastructure 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter as a result of differences in the timing of expenses incurred and revenues recognized 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations primarily through public sales and private placements of our common and preferred stock  debt financings  payments received pursuant to our exenatide collaboration with lilly and our obesity collaboration with takeda  reimbursement of symlin development expenses through earlier collaboration agreements  and since the second quarter of  through product sales of byetta and symlin 
at december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  compared to million at december  and we have million of cash available to us pursuant to the loan agreement with lilly discussed below 
we have debt maturities of million in the second quarter of we have demonstrated strong financial discipline over the last few years and we are committed to continuing to manage our expenses closely in line with expected revenues 
we will continue to aggressively manage our expenses to minimize the amount of cash we use for operating activities 
our current business plan does not contemplate a need to raise additional funds from outside sources  however  we may evaluate opportunities to refinance existing indebtedness from time to time 
if we require additional financing in the future  we cannot assure you that it will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
although we have previously been successful in obtaining financing through our debt and equity securities offerings  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
our operating activities used cash of million  provided cash of million and used cash of million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our cash used by our operating activities for the year ended december  includes a net loss of million  million of which is comprised of non cash items consisting primarily of stock based compensation  depreciation and amortization and restructuring charges 
cash provided by operating activities in the year ended december  included an up front payment of million from takeda in connection with our collaboration with them and cash used by operations in the year ended december  reflects an up front payment of million from lilly in connection with our collaboration with them 
our primary uses of cash for our operating activities for the year ended december  includes uses of cash due to decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  accrued compensation and payable to collaborative partner of million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily reflects lower expense levels for the year ended december  compared to the same period of the decrease in accrued compensation reflects lower incentive compensation due to the decision to not pay the discretionary corporate bonus for the year ended december  the decrease in the payable to the collaborative partner reflects a reduced net payable to lilly which resulted from higher cost sharing payments due from lilly as well as lower collaborative profit sharing due to lilly 
the higher cost sharing payments due from lilly were caused by increased development expenses for bydureon  and the lower collaborative profit sharing is the result of lower byetta sales and gross profit in the twelve months ended december  our primary sources of cash for our operating activities for the year ended december  includes sources of cash due to an increase in deferred collaborative profit sharing of million  and decreases in inventories  accounts receivable and other current assets of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in deferred collaborative profit sharing reflects payments due to us from lilly for its share of the capital expenditures we have made for the bydureon pen device 
the decrease in inventories primarily reflects reductions in raw materials  work in process and finished goods inventory due to the timing and volume of production for byetta and symlin 
as indicated in note to the consolidated financial statements  inventories as of december  includes million of raw materials specific to bydureon which amount is entirely comprised of exenatide  the active pharmaceutical ingredient for bydureon 
as of december   the exenatide balance was recorded in other current assets because exenatide for bydureon can also be used to manufacture byetta 
we are currently manufacturing bydureon to support lilly requirements for launches outside of the united states 
lilly expects an action by the european medicines agency in the first half of the decrease in accounts receivable is primarily due to lower product sales 
the decrease in other current assets is due to declines in prepaid expenses 
working capital changes may fluctuate from quarter to quarter due to timing of inventory and other current asset purchases and the timing of payment of accounts payable  accrued compensation and other current liabilities 
our investing activities provided cash of million in the year ended december  and used cash of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
investing activities in all three years consisted primarily of purchases and sales of short term investments and purchases of property  plant and equipment 
purchases of property  plant and equipment decreased to million in from million in  and decreased to in from million in the decrease in was as expected and primarily reflects a reduction of costs associated with our manufacturing facility for bydureon  offset by costs incurred in connection with the bydureon pen device 
the initial capital investment for the pen is expected to be million over the next few years  which will be funded by lilly and by us 
through december   we have incurred million in capital expenditures associated with the bydureon pen device and incurred total combined capital expenditures for the manufacturing facility and the pen device of million 
we have billed lilly million for its share of expenditures for the pen device  of which million has been received to date  million of which was received during and is included in cash used for operating activities as discussed above 
we expect that our capital expenditures will continue to decrease in and will be principally focused on strategically investing in exenatide life cycle management  of which lilly shares in of the costs 
we will continue to evaluate potential additional investments in our ohio manufacturing facility during the product life cycle for bydureon  if approved 
financing activities used cash of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively  and provided cash of million in the year ended december  financing activities in include million in scheduled repayments of our note payable  which was paid in full during the year  offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities in include million in repayments of our note payable partially offset by proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan 
financing activities in include proceeds from the exercise of stock options and proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan 
at december   we had million in aggregate principal amount of the notes due april  and million of the notes due june  outstanding 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to million shares of our common stock at approximately per share and are not redeemable at our option 
the notes are currently convertible into a total of up to million shares of our common stock at approximately per share and are not redeemable at our option 
in october  we entered into a loan agreement with lilly pursuant to which lilly made available to us a million unsecured line of credit that we can draw upon from time to time until june  as of december  we had not drawn upon this line of credit 
any interest due under this credit facility will bear interest at the five day average three month libor rate immediately prior to the date of the advance plus and shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on the first business day of each quarter 
all outstanding principal  together with all accrued and unpaid interest  shall be due and payable the earlier of months following the date on which the loan commitment is fully advanced or june  in december  we entered into a million credit agreement which provided for a million term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility also provided for the issuance of letters of credit and foreign exchange hedging up to the million borrowing limit 
in connection with the credit agreement we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which resulted in a fixed interest rate of under the term loan and expired in december in december we paid the term loan in full and terminated the revolving credit facility 
as of december  we had million of letters of credit outstanding which are secured by million of restricted cash pursuant to a line of credit and cash collateral agreement entered into in december the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and maturity dates as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term convertible debt interest on long term convertible debt inventory purchase obligations construction contracts operating leases total excludes long term obligation of million related to deferred compensation  the payment of which is subject to elections made by participants that are subject to change 
in addition  under certain license and collaboration agreements we are required to pay royalties and or milestone payments upon the successful development and commercialization of related products 
we expect to make development milestone payments up to million associated with licensing agreements in the next months 
additional milestones of up to approximately million could be paid over the next two to seven years if development and commercialization of all our early stage programs continue and are successful 
the majority of these milestones relate to potential future regulatory approvals and subsequent sales thresholds 
given the inherent risk in pharmaceutical development  it is highly unlikely that we will ultimately make all of these milestone payments  however  we would consider these payments as positive because they would signify that the related products are successfully moving through development and commercialization 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the amount of product sales we and lilly achieve for byetta and bydureon  if approved  net of profit sharing payments to lilly  and product sales for symlin  costs associated with the continued commercialization of byetta and symlin and the commercialization of bydureon  if approved  costs associated with the operation of our bydureon manufacturing facility  costs of potential licenses or acquisitions  the potential need to repay existing indebtedness  our ability to receive or need to make milestone payments  our ability  and the extent to which we establish collaborative arrangements for symlin or any of our product candidates  progress in our research and development programs and the magnitude of these programs  costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  enforcing or defending our patents  competing technological and market developments  and costs of manufacturing  including costs associated with establishing our own manufacturing capabilities or obtaining and validating additional manufacturers of our products  and scale up costs for our drug candidates 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are currently or reasonably likely to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our excess cash primarily in united states government securities  asset backed securities  and debt instruments of financial institutions and corporations with investment grade credit ratings 
these instruments have various short term maturities 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions in any material fashion 
accordingly  we believe that  while the instruments held are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  equity prices or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive investments 
our debt is not subject to significant swings in valuation as interest rates on our debt are fixed 
the fair value of our notes and notes at december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our financial instruments that are exposed to changes in interest rates
