item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the selected historical consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
general since the late s  we have derived virtually all of our revenue from the sale of suspension assemblies to a small number of customers 
we currently supply a variety of suspension assemblies to all manufacturers of disk drives and head gimbal assemblers for all sizes of disk drives 
suspension assemblies are a critical component of disk drives  and our results of operations are highly dependent on the disk drive industry 
the disk drive industry is intensely competitive  and demand for disk drive components fluctuates 
our results of operations are affected from time to time by disk drive industry demand changes  adjustments in inventory levels throughout the disk drive supply chain  technological changes that impact suspension assembly demand  shifts in our market position and our customers market position  changes in supply chain alignment by a customer  our customers production yields and our own product transitions  production yields and production capacity utilization 
our biomeasurement division is engaged in the development  production and commercialization of products for the medical device market 
net sales from the inspectra sto systems during  our fourth full year in the market  were  slower than expected sales growth based on the current pace of adoption of the inspectra sto systems and spending constraints in healthcare markets world wide led us to initiate operating changes within the biomeasurement division in to reduce our operating loss 
in  due to the weak economy  consumer spending declined and retail demand for computers and other consumer electronics decreased  as well as business demand for computer systems  and demand for suspension assemblies therefore was adversely impacted 
in response to weakened demand and due to changing and uncertain market and economic conditions  in we took actions to reduce our cost structure and improve our cash flow to help us to meet the current portion of our debt obligations and make strategic investments as needed 
to achieve improvements in efficiency and facility utilization and to reduce operating costs  we closed our sioux falls  south dakota facility at the end of june and consolidated the related suspension assembly operations into our eau claire  wisconsin and hutchinson  minnesota sites 
we also consolidated photoetching operations into our hutchinson  minnesota site and trace operations into our eau claire  wisconsin site 
in addition to the weakened demand  during the third quarter of  we were notified by one of our customers  seagate  that it intended to significantly reduce its procurement of our suspension assemblies 
while the overall market for suspension assemblies grew in  our shipments of suspension assemblies declined from due to further market share losses 
in addition  a defect on some of our tsa product resulted in lost volume in the third and fourth quarters of during the fourth quarter  we took actions to reduce costs and preserve cash 
in  improvements in our tsa product yield and output  together with a faster than expected ramp of our assembly operation in thailand  provided an opportunity to further lower our operating costs 
with the transition from our legacy tsa component manufacturing process to our more automated tsa process  we needed fewer employees to meet customers volume requirements 
additionally  progress at our thailand assembly operation enabled us to accelerate the transition of assembly manufacturing to that location and consolidate our hutchinson  minnesota components operations into our operations in eau claire  wisconsin 
our hutchinson  minnesota site continues to serve as our corporate headquarters  our center for research and development  our biomeasurement division site and for manufacturing of suspension assemblies and precision components for several industries outside of the disk drive industry 
we are also taking additional actions to resize the company  reduce costs and improve cash flow while keeping intact capabilities core to our competitive position and future growth 
the consolidation and restructuring actions included elimination of approximately positions from our us workforce resulting in estimated charges for severance of  subsequent to year end  due to the flooding in thailand  we are leveraging our us assembly operations to offset the temporary loss of capacity in thailand 
this is expected to result in our retaining approximately employees in our hutchinson  minnesota manufacturing facility that we previously expected to terminate and that were included in our expected severance charges 
this will result in a reduction of our severance expense by approximately  during our quarter ending december  approximately  of other expenses and  of capital expenditures related to consolidation of the hutchinson  minnesota components operations into our operations in eau claire  wisconsin 
as of september    of other expenses and the full  of capital expenditures had been paid 
shortening of the lives of the hutchinson  minnesota components operations long lived assets  which resulted in accelerated depreciation of  included within cost of sales 
the full realization of our cost reductions from the consolidation and restructuring actions will be delayed by the impact of the flooding in thailand on our operations 
we still estimate our plan will reduce our costs by approximately  on an annualized basis 
when we will fully realize those benefits depends on how quickly we are able to resume operations and increase our assembly output in thailand 
we completed construction of our thailand assembly facility in during our fourth quarter  approximately of our sales originated out of that facility 
by the end of that quarter  our thailand operations had an assembly capacity of four to five million parts per week and was meeting our expectations for volume  quality and costs 
subsequent to our year end  severe flooding in thailand required us to suspend our thailand assembly operations in the second week of october although we expect it will take multiple quarters  we intend to fully resume operations in thailand  restore our operation to its previous assembly capacity and work with third parties to mitigate the impact that future flooding could have on our operations  as our thailand operation remains integral to enabling us to become the industry s lowest cost producer of suspension assemblies 
we spent approximately  in capital expenditures in related to our thailand assembly operation 
we also spent approximately  in and  in on facility start up expenses 
the floodwaters have recently receded and we have started to assess the damage to our operations and the financial impact of our recovery effort and insurance proceeds 
at the time our thailand facility flooded  it had a book value of approximately  our manufacturing and office equipment in thailand had book value of approximately  and we had approximately  of inventories in thailand  including inventory hubs at off site locations in thailand 
the replacement value of our manufacturing equipment is higher than the recorded book values 
in the first quarter of  we expect to record impairment charges estimated at between  to  related to facility equipment and fixtures  manufacturing equipment and tooling and inventories that were damaged due to the floodwater 
in  we estimate we will spend  to  excluding any reimbursements from insurance coverage related to our thailand operation including thailand facility equipment and restoration expenses  manufacturing equipment and tooling and other expenses  and expenses associated with the higher cost of our us manufacturing 
all of these estimates are based on our preliminary damage assessment and it is reasonably possible that the estimate will change in the near term and the effect of the change could be material 
our insurance policy provides for  of flood coverage for property and casualty damages and business interruption 
we currently expect that our claims will exceed this amount 
subsequent to year end  we received an initial insurance payment of  the timing of our cash flows for flood related expenditures and insurance proceeds is uncertain at this time 
however  we have modeled various scenarios and we believe we have sufficient liquidity to manage through the recovery 
we are leveraging our us assembly operations to offset the temporary loss of capacity in thailand 
our available assembly capacity and vertically integrated components operations in the us are enabling us to meet current levels of customer demand and should provide us with the flexibility to respond to increases in demand as the supply chain recovers 
as we enter  in addition to the impact on our operations  the flooding in thailand is constraining the overall capacity of the hard disk drive supply chain 
the resulting reduction in disk drive production is expected to result in a material decrease in demand for suspension assemblies in our first quarter 
in this uncertain environment  we estimate our first quarter suspension assembly shipments will be million to million 
as the industry and the supply chain recover  inventories will likely need to be replenished and we expect suspension assembly demand to recover 
to return to profitability  we must increase revenues through volume growth in our disk drive components division 
volume growth will come through capturing overall market growth and through regaining market share 
we believe improvements in our tsa efficiency and output  coupled with cost reductions that will result from restoring and ramping up assembly operations at our plant in thailand  will help us resume volume growth 
in  we completed offers to exchange for new securities or purchase for cash a portion of our outstanding notes 
we retired an aggregate principal amount of  of our  original aggregate principal amount of notes 
we made cash payments of  for the purchase of  aggregate principal amount of the notes and we issued  aggregate principal amount of our notes in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
after completion of the exchanges and purchases  we have reduced the outstanding principal amount of the notes from  to  in our biomeasurement division  we have substantially reduced costs to narrow the division s operating losses 
the division s loss from operations for was  compared to a  loss for the biomeasurement division s loss for includes  of asset impairments in this division 
the following table sets forth our quarterly suspension assembly shipment quantities for our disk drive components division in millions for the periods indicated by quarter by quarter first second third fourth first second third fourth suspension assembly shipment quantities in our second quarter  our percent sequential quarter decline in shipments was more than the estimated decline in world wide suspension assembly shipments 
this market share loss resulted primarily from our broad implementation of a tsa process improvement in that quarter that prevented us from meeting demand and from share shifts among disk drive manufacturers 
our third quarter shipments declined about percent sequentially  primarily due to reductions in disk drive makers production plans 
in addition  we lost volume late in the quarter due to a defect on some of our tsa product that prevented us from realizing expected share growth opportunities on certain customer programs 
our fourth quarter shipments declined about five percent due to inventory reductions at a certain customer that reduced our shipments  and shipments were also negatively impacted by the tsa product defect we encountered late in the third quarter of our first quarter shipments decreased about four percent compared with the preceding quarter  primarily due to one of our customers managing down its existing inventory 
our second quarter shipments decreased an additional four percent compared with the preceding quarter as a result of our customers reduced production plans 
our third quarter suspension assembly shipments increased percent to million 
shipments to all of our customers increased and we estimate that we gained a modest amount of market share in all disk drive segments as a result of share shifts among our customers and improvements in our share positions on some existing customer programs 
our fourth quarter shipments increased eight percent sequentially primarily due to an increase in shipments of suspension assemblies for mobile applications 
our average selling price decreased from in the first half of to in our fourth quarter the decrease in our average selling price was a result of a continuing competitive pricing environment and a change in the mix of products shipped 
suspension assembly pricing is likely to remain competitive  though normal pricing pressures could be offset somewhat during the current supply chain disruptions due to flooding in thailand 
our gross profits have fluctuated and will continue to fluctuate based upon a variety of factors  key among them being changes in demand for our suspension assemblies 
our customers often prefer a multiple source supply strategy and  therefore  may allocate their demand among suppliers 
we plan our production and inventory based primarily on forecasts of customer demand  including forecasts of customer pulls of product out of our vmi facilities 
certain agreements with our customers also provide that we maintain minimum finished goods inventory levels for them 
both customer demand and the resulting forecasts often fluctuate substantially 
these factors  among others  create an environment where scheduled production and capacity utilization can vary significantly from week to week  leading to variability in gross profits and difficulty in estimating our position in the marketplace 
from the end of to the first quarter of  we substantially improved our gross margin despite a decline in net sales 
the improvement was the result of the actions we took in to restructure our business and reduce our costs  as well as a turnaround in demand that began in the latter half of gross profit decreased in the remainder of and the first half of  however  due to reduced sales as a result of a decline in suspension assembly shipments primarily due to market share losses and lower average selling prices 
in the second half of  gross profit was benefited by increased suspension assembly shipments due to modest market share gains  the mix of products sold and cost savings from our consolidation and restructuring plan 
in addition to increases in suspension assembly demand  improvement in our gross profits and operating profits will depend  in part  on the successful management of our corporate infrastructure and our suspension assembly production capacity 
our business is capital intensive and requires a high level of fixed costs 
our profits are sensitive to our level of fixed costs  as well as changes in volume  capacity utilization and product mix 
in the future  we may need to adjust our overall employment level due to fluctuating demand 
our overall employment level was  at the end of   at the end of and  at the end of we shipped million tsa suspension assemblies during  up from million in and million in for  we expect tsa suspension assemblies to account for a steadily increasing proportion of our shipments  growing from approximately of our shipments in the fourth quarter of to of our shipments by the end of we believe the industry will fully transition to additive suspensions over the next two to four years 
we are also purchasing additive flexures to fill other customer requirements 
we continue to see strong customer interest in dual stage actuated or dsa suspension assemblies and we are working with our customers on multiple dsa programs 
we currently expect demand for dsa suspensions to develop gradually in the first half of  depending primarily on the pace at which the disk drive makers launch new programs during this period of industry disruption due to the thailand flooding and  therefore  suspension assemblies 
we are ready to meet the demand for dsa suspensions as it materializes and all of our dsa capacity is currently at our us sites 
for  our capital expenditures were  primarily for tsa suspension production capacity  new program tooling and deployment of new process technology and capability improvements 
capital expenditures for were  primarily for manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements  new program tooling and thailand assembly related equipment 
prior to the flooding in thailand  we estimated our capital expenditures in to be approximately  primarily for manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements  such as dsa suspension assemblies and new program tooling 
the estimate does not take into account capital expenditures that will be required to restore operations in thailand  which we estimate will be an additional  to  market trends our suspension assemblies are components in hard disk drives used in computers and a variety of consumer electronics products 
we believe that the continued growth of digital content world wide requires increasingly higher storage capacity in order to store  aggregate  host  distribute  manage and backup content  which we believe will continue to result in increased demand for disk drives 
non compute applications  such as digital video recorders dvrs  gaming devices  digital cameras and internet based storage of consumer data are driving the broad  global growth of digital content through creation and sharing of all types of digital content  such as high resolution photos  high definition video and movies  and music by consumers and data by enterprises  collection and distribution of digital content through services and other company offerings such as youtube by google  inc  network infrastructure  including broadband  cable and satellite  which is enabling the access  hosting and distribution of digital content  consumption of digital content through dvrs  handheld devices and gaming consoles  and protection of content through storage backup devices and services 
however  the demand for disk drives and  therefore  suspension assemblies can be volatile as experienced since calendar due to market and world economic conditions 
in a weak economy  consumer spending tends to decline and retail demand for computers and other consumer electronics tends to decrease  as does business demand for computer systems 
demand for suspension assemblies  therefore  may be adversely impacted as a result of a weaker economy 
in the long term  however  we expect that the growth in digital content and the expanding use of enterprise computing and storage  desktop and mobile computers  increasingly complex software as well as the data intensive non compute market will increase demand for disk drives and  therefore  suspension assemblies 
we also believe demand for disk drives will continue to be subject  as it has in the past  to rapid or unforeseen changes resulting from  among other things  changes in disk drive inventory levels  technological advances  responses to competitive price changes and unpredicted high or low market acceptance of new drive models and the end devices in which disk drives are used 
as in past years  disk drives continue to be the primary storage device of choice for applications requiring shorter access times and higher capacities because of their speed and low cost per unit of stored data 
the cost of storing data on disk drives continues to decrease primarily due to increasing data density  thereby increasing storage capacity in disk drives or reducing the number of components  including suspension assemblies  required in a disk drive 
the continual pursuit of increased data density and lower storage costs is leading to suspension assemblies with flexures that have finer electrical conductors  greater lead counts and increased complexity such as interleaved or stacked traces or dsa suspension designs  and to the adoption of value added features for suspension assemblies  such as formed and polished headlifts  larger dampers with through hole features and a variety of limiter configurations 
the development of next generation read write technology and the introduction of new types or configurations of read write heads configurations and sizes  and the continuing improvement in data density and the use of disk drives in consumer electronics applications will require even finer electrical conductors on the suspension assembly 
next generation disk drives also may require additional electrical conductors 
these changes may temporarily increase our development spending and reduce our manufacturing yields and efficiencies 
we are investing in developing the process capabilities and related capital equipment required to meet new industry specifications in and beyond 
the advent of new disk drive technologies may initially decrease our customers yields with the result that we may experience temporary elevations of demand for some types of suspension assemblies 
as programs mature  higher customer yields decrease the demand for suspension assemblies 
in addition  disk drive manufacturers are increasingly seeking lower cost designs and suspension assembly pricing is highly competitive 
while we are generally able to increase our selling price for suspension assemblies when they are introduced  our selling prices decrease as our products mature 
operations to operations the following table sets forth our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales from period to period 
percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses severance and other expenses asset impairment and other charges loss from operations gain on extinguishment of debt other income  net interest expense gain loss on short and long term investments loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net loss net sales for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  suspension assembly sales decreased  primarily as a result of an percent decrease in suspension assembly unit shipments and our average selling price decreased nine percent year over year from an average of in to an average of in due to a competitive pricing environment and the mix of products shipped 
the decrease in suspension assembly unit shipments in was primarily due to market share losses 
net sales in our biomeasurement division were  in  compared to  in gross profit for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  gross profit as a percent of net sales was four percent in  compared to nine percent in the lower gross profit in was primarily the result of reduced sales  which reduced our ability to cover our fixed costs  no longer classifying our thailand assembly manufacturing start up expenses as selling  general and administrative expenses and  of accelerated depreciation as a result of the consolidation and restructuring plan 
these were partially offset by the cost savings from our consolidation and restructuring plan discussed above 
research and development expenses for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease was primarily related to lower labor expenses as a result of cost reduction actions 
research and development expenses specific to our biomeasurement division were  in and  in research and development expenses as a percent of net sales were five percent in and six percent in selling  general and administrative expenses for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  the lower selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to classifying our thailand assembly manufacturing expenses as cost of sales beginning with the quarter ended march  and lower biomeasurement division expenses primarily due to restructuring actions 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were percent in and percent in selling  general and administrative expenses specific to our biomeasurement division were  in and  in during the second quarter of  we announced a manufacturing consolidation and restructuring plan that included eliminating approximately positions from our us workforce 
the workforce reduction and manufacturing consolidation resulted in a charge for severance and other expenses of  of which  was related to our biomeasurement division 
at the end of   remained to be paid 
subsequent to year end  due to the flooding in thailand  we are leveraging our us assembly operations to offset the temporary loss of capacity in thailand 
this is expected to result in our retaining approximately employees in our hutchinson  minnesota manufacturing facility that we previously expected to terminate and that were included in our expected severance charges 
this will result in a reduction of our severance expense by approximately  during our quarter ending december  the workforce reductions are expected to be completed by the end of our second quarter during the fourth quarter of  we announced actions to reduce costs  including eliminating approximately positions company wide 
the workforce reduction resulted in a charge for severance expenses of  loss from operations for included a  loss from operations for our biomeasurement division compared to a  loss for the biomeasurement division s loss for included  of asset impairments in this division 
the biomeasurement division operating loss was reduced by restructuring actions 
interest income for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a lower investment balance 
the gain on short and long term investments for was  compared to a loss of  for the gain in was due to payments we received under a settlement agreement 
auction rate securities ars previously held by us were subsequently sold by the settlement parties at a price that was higher than the price identified in the settlement agreement 
the loss for was due to the settlement agreement providing for the sale of a portion of our ars portfolio 
in february  we retired an aggregate principal amount of  of the notes 
we made cash payments of  for the purchase of  aggregate principal amount of the notes and we issued  aggregate principal amount of the notes in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
in july  we completed another exchange  in which we issued  aggregate principal amount of the notes and made aggregate cash payments of  in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
a total of  aggregate principal amount of the notes remained outstanding after completion of the july exchange 
we determined that the purchases and exchanges were a substantial debt modification and applied debt extinguishment accounting 
the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the liability component of our debt at the date of extinguishment was recorded as an  gain on extinguishment of debt 
the difference between the fair value of the liability component and the fair value of the consideration exchanged was applied as reacquisition of the equity component  which resulted in a  reduction to additional paid in capital 
the income tax provision for was  compared to a benefit of  for the income tax benefit for was primarily due to a change in us tax law that enabled us to carry back some of our operating losses to prior years and apply for a refund of taxes paid in those years 
this benefit was partially offset by foreign income tax expense 
operations to operations net sales for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  suspension assembly sales decreased  primarily as a result of a seven percent decrease in suspension assembly unit shipments and our average selling price decreased eight percent year over year from an average of in to an average of in due to competitive pressures 
the decrease in suspension assembly unit shipments in was primarily due to market share losses 
net sales in our biomeasurement division were  in  compared to  in gross profit for was  compared to  for  an increase of  gross profit as a percent of net sales was nine percent in  compared to two percent in the higher gross profit in was primarily due to the benefits of our restructuring and cost reduction actions  and lower deprecation

research and development expenses for were  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease was primarily related to lower labor expenses as a result of our restructuring and cost reduction actions  partially offset by  of asset impairments in our biomeasurement division 
research and development expenses specific to our biomeasurement division were  in and  in research and development expenses as a percent of net sales were six percent in and seven percent in selling  general and administrative expenses for were  compared to  for  an increase of  the higher selling  general and administrative expenses were primarily due to  of thailand operation start up expenses and  of asset impairments in our biomeasurement division  offset by reductions in labor expenses as a result of our restructuring and cost reduction actions 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were percent in and percent in selling  general and administrative expenses specific to our biomeasurement division were  in and  in in response to weakening demand for suspension assemblies and due to changing and uncertain market and economic conditions  we took actions to reduce our costs in during the first quarter of  we announced a restructuring plan that included eliminating positions company wide 
during january  we eliminated approximately  positions 
the workforce reduction resulted in a charge for severance and other expenses of  which were included in our first quarter of financial results 
the workforce reductions were completed by the end of january during the first quarter of  we recorded non cash impairment charges of  for the impairment of long lived assets related to manufacturing equipment in our disk drive components division s assembly and component operations 
the impairment review was triggered by weakened demand for suspension assemblies and uncertain future market conditions 
in response to these conditions  we made structural changes to consolidate some of our component and assembly manufacturing among our sites 
during the second quarter of  we took actions to further restructure the company and reduce our overall cost structure in our disk drive components division 
we closed our sioux falls  south dakota facility at the end of june and consolidated the related suspension assembly operations into our eau claire  wisconsin and hutchinson  minnesota sites 
the assembly operations consolidation resulted in a net elimination of approximately positions 
in addition  we consolidated our eau claire  wisconsin site s photoetching operations into our hutchinson  minnesota site and our hutchinson  minnesota site s trace operations into our eau claire  wisconsin site to achieve improvements in efficiency and facility utilization and to reduce operating costs 
we also reduced the workforce in our components operation in eau claire  wisconsin by approximately positions 
the second quarter workforce reductions resulted in a charge for severance and other expenses of  in response to further weakened demand for suspension assemblies and as a result of the additional restructuring actions in the second quarter discussed above  we recorded non cash impairment charges of  in the second quarter of for the impairment of long lived assets related to manufacturing equipment in our disk drive components division s assembly and component operations 
during the third quarter of  we took actions to reduce costs and improve cash flow 
we further restructured the company to adjust to market conditions and the expected phase out of suspension assembly shipments to one of our customers  seagate 
the restructuring actions included eliminating approximately additional positions 
the third quarter workforce reductions resulted in a charge for severance and other expenses of  during the third quarter of  as a result of the expected phase out of suspension assembly shipments to seagate  and the restructuring actions in the third quarter discussed above  we recorded additional non cash impairment charges of  for the impairment of long lived assets primarily related to assembly manufacturing equipment in our disk drive components division 
during the fourth quarter of  we announced actions to further reduce costs  including eliminating approximately positions company wide 
the workforce reduction resulted in a charge for severance expenses of  of which   remains to be paid 
loss from operations for included a  loss from operations for our biomeasurement division compared to a  loss for the biomeasurement division s loss for includes  of asset impairments in this division  discussed above 
interest income for was  compared to  for  a decrease of  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to a lower investment balance and a decline in interest rates as a result of an overall lower interest rate environment 
the loss on short and long term investments for was  compared to a gain of  for the gain in was primarily due to a gain of  in the value of the securities subject to the offer by ubs ag  ubs financial services inc and ubs securities llc collectively  ubs to issue to us ars rights the rights offering  which was offset by a  loss we recognized due to an impairment of our ars held with ubs 
during  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our convertible subordinated notes that were retired in march of the notes the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at varying discounts to face value 
upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  is included in our consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
at the time of repurchase  the notes had a book value of  which includes the par value of the notes  offset by the remaining debt discount of  upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  is included in our consolidated financial statements 
the income tax benefit for was  the income tax benefit in was due primarily to a change in us tax law that enabled us to carry back some of our operating losses to prior years and apply for a refund of taxes paid in those years of  these refunds were offset by  of foreign tax expense 
the income tax benefit for was  the income tax benefit for was due primarily to certain provisions of the american recovery and reinvestment act of that permit certain tax credits to be converted into cash refunds in lieu of claiming bonus depreciation  which was partially reduced by foreign income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and additional financing capacity  if available given current credit market conditions and our operating performance 
our cash and cash equivalents increased from  at september   to  at september  our short and long term investments decreased from  to  during the same period 
in total  our cash and cash equivalents and short and long term investments decreased by  this decrease was primarily due to  used for repurchases of short and long term debt   for capital expenditures and  of cash used by operations 
the decreases were partially offset by  in borrowings outstanding at year end under the revolving credit and security agreement between us and pnc bank 
in light of the significant decreases in our net sales over the past two completed fiscal years and current uncertain market and economic conditions  we are aggressively managing our cost structure and cash position to ensure that we will meet our debt obligations while preserving the ability to make investments that will enable us to respond to customer requirements and achieve long term profitable growth 
we currently believe that our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations and additional financing  if needed and as available given current credit market conditions and our operating performance  will be sufficient to meet our forecasted operating expenses  other debt service requirements  debt and equity repurchases and capital expenditures through we currently have outstanding  aggregate principal amount of our notes 
holders of our notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash as early as january  we also currently have outstanding  aggregate principal amount of our notes 
holders of our notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash as early as january  we anticipate that we would need to obtain additional financing if the holders of our notes require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on that date 
we may from time to time seek to prepay or retire our outstanding debt through cash purchases in open market or privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
these transactions  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend upon a number of factors  including our future performance and financial results and general economic and capital market conditions 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to raise additional financing on terms acceptable to us  including covenants that we will be able to comply with in the short term  or at all  if needed 
if we are unable to obtain new financing  if and when necessary  our future financial results and liquidity could be materially adversely affected 
effective december   we entered into a settlement with ubs that provided liquidity for our ars portfolio held with ubs and to resolve pending litigation between the parties 
the settlement provided for certain arrangements  one of which was our acceptance of an offer by ubs to issue the rights offering to us  which allowed us to require ubs to repurchase at par value all of the ars held by us in accounts with ubs at any time during the period from june  through july  if our ars had not previously been sold by us or by ubs on our behalf or redeemed by the respective issuers of those securities 
during the fourth quarter of  we exercised the rights issued to us in the rights offering for the remaining ars held by us and subject to the rights offering 
as part of the ubs settlement  we also entered into a loan agreement with ubs credit corp 
ubs credit  which provided us with a line of credit secured only by the ars we held in accounts with ubs 
the proceeds derived from any sales of the ars we held in accounts with ubs were to be applied to repayment of the ubs credit line 
following our exercise of the rights issued to us in the rights offering  the proceeds of the repurchase of ars were applied to repay borrowings under the loan agreement 
as of september   we had repaid all of the line of credit available to us from ubs credit 
on march   we entered into a settlement agreement with citigroup global markets inc cgmi providing for the sale of a portion of our ars 
we received approximately  in cash plus accrued interest in exchange for  in principal amount of our ars 
as a result  we recorded an additional realized loss on the sale of these ars of  during the quarter ended march  as of december   we had recorded an other than temporary realized loss of  on these ars 
for a three year period  the settlement agreement with cgmi provides us with the option to repurchase some or all of these ars at the price for which we sold them  and the potential for additional recoveries in the event of issuer redemptions 
as part of the settlement agreement  we agreed to dismiss with prejudice an arbitration proceeding between us and cgmi and an affiliate of cgmi relating to these ars 
in january  we issued  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the notes were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of january  the indenture 
interest on the notes is payable on january and july of each year  which began on july  since january   we have had the right to redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at specified redemption prices  as provided in the indenture  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but excluding  the applicable redemption date 
holders of the notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash on january   january   and january   or in the event of a fundamental change  at a purchase price equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  to  but excluding  the purchase date 
we may from time to time seek to retire portions of the outstanding notes through cash repurchases or exchanges for the securities in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
under certain circumstances  holders of the notes may convert their notes based on a conversion rate of shares of our common stock per  principal amount of notes which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
upon conversion  in lieu of shares of our common stock  for each  principal amount of notes a holder will receive an amount in cash equal to the lesser of i  or ii the conversion value  determined in the manner set forth in the indenture  of the number of shares of our common stock equal to the conversion rate 
if the conversion value exceeds  we also will deliver  at our election  cash or common stock or a combination of cash and common stock with respect to the remaining common stock deliverable upon conversion 
during the fourth quarter of  we spent  to repurchase  par value of our notes on the open market using our available cash and cash equivalents  at an average discount to face value of approximately percent 
at the time of the repurchase  the notes had a book value of  which includes the par value of the notes  offset by the remaining debt discount of  upon completion of the repurchases  the repurchased notes were cancelled 
the resulting gain of  is included in our consolidated financial statements 
in february  we completed a tender exchange  through which we retired an aggregate principal amount of  of the notes 
we made cash payments of  for the purchase of  aggregate principal amount of the notes and we issued  aggregate principal amount of the notes pursuant to an indenture dated as of february  in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
the notes are senior in right of payment to any of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness  including the notes that remain outstanding 
interest is payable on the notes on january and july of each year  beginning july  the notes mature on january  each  principal amount of the notes is convertible into shares of our common stock which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
we have the right to redeem the notes i on or after january  to  but excluding  january   if the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds of the conversion price  and ii at any time on or after january   in either case in whole or in part  for cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be redeemed plus any accrued but unpaid interest to  but excluding the redemption date 
holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes at par on each of january   january  and january  for cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus any accrued but unpaid interest to but excluding the repurchase date 
if a fundamental change as defined in the indenture occurs  each holder of notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or any portion of that holder s notes for cash equal to percent of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus any accrued but unpaid interest to  but excluding the repurchase date 
in july  we completed an exchange  in which we issued  aggregate principal amount of the notes and made aggregate cash payments of  in exchange for  aggregate principal amount of the notes 
a total of  aggregate principal amount of the notes remained outstanding after completion of the july exchange 
at a special meeting held june   our shareholders approved the issuance of up to  aggregate principal amount of additional notes and the issuance of our common stock upon conversion thereof for cash in one or more future private placements or registered offerings 
accordingly  we may  but are not obligated to  issue a limited amount of additional notes without further shareholder approval 
on september   we entered into a revolving credit and security agreement with pnc bank under which  was outstanding at the end of the credit agreement provides us with a revolving credit facility in a principal amount of up to  subject to a borrowing base 
the credit facility is secured by substantially all of the personal property of hutchinson technology incorporated 
the maturity date of the credit facility is october  if  by october   the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the notes is reduced to  or less and we have at least  of liquidity remaining  otherwise the maturity date is october  the credit agreement contains customary representations  warranties  covenants and events of default  including  but not limited to limitations on the payment of dividends and repurchases of stock  financial covenants requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda and minimum liquidity 
we maintain an account at pnc bank with a minimum balance of  as required under the credit agreement 
subsequent to our fiscal year end  the suspension of production in our thailand facility related to the flooding there triggered an event of default provision related to business interruptions under the credit agreement  and we have obtained a waiver of the event of default 
we currently have no borrowings drawn under the credit agreement and the event of default did not trigger any cross default provisions in our other financing arrangements 
due to the expected material negative impact of the thailand flooding on our results of operations  we also may be out of compliance with one financial covenant in the credit agreement at the end of our first quarter 
if necessary  we intend to negotiate a waiver of any noncompliance or an amendment of the financial covenant specific to the applicable period 
our suspension assembly business is capital intensive 
the disk drive industry experiences rapid technology changes that require us to make substantial ongoing capital expenditures in product and process improvements to maintain our competitiveness 
significant industry technology transitions often result in increasing our capital expenditures 
the disk drive industry also experiences periods of increased demand and rapid growth followed by periods of oversupply and subsequent contraction  which also results in fluctuations in our capital expenditures 
cash used for capital expenditures totaled  for   for and  for capital expenditures for were primarily for manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements  new program tooling and thailand assembly related equipment 
capital expenditures for were primarily for additional tsa flexure production capacity  establishing our thailand assembly operation and new program tooling 
we currently anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately  in  primarily for manufacturing equipment for new process technology and capability improvements  such as dsa suspension assemblies and product tooling 
the estimate does not take into account capital expenditures that will be required to restore operations in thailand  which we estimate will be an additional  to  as the full transition to tsa suspensions takes place over the next one to three years  our capital expenditures could increase as we add capacity as needed 
financing of these capital expenditures will be principally from operations  our current cash  cash equivalents  the revolving credit and security agreement with pnc bank or additional financing  if available given current credit market conditions 
our capital expenditures for the disk drive components division are planned based on process improvements to be incorporated in our manufacturing operations and the rate at which our customers adopt new generations of higher performance disk drives and next generation read write technology and head sizes  which may require new or improved process technologies  such as additive processing to produce flexures for our tsa suspensions or dsa suspensions  anticipated customer demand for our suspension assembly products and market demand for disk drives 
capital spending is also based on our ability to finance capital expenditures  as discussed above 
we manage our capital spending to reflect the capacity that we expect will be needed to meet disk drive industry customer forecasts 
however  existing work in process with vendors and lengthy lead times sometimes prevent us from adjusting our capital expenditures to match near term demand 
this can result in underutilization of capacity  which could lower gross profit 
as we develop the market for our inspectra sto systems  we will continue to spend money on medical device sales in our biomeasurement division 
for  our biomeasurement division incurred an operating loss of  and we expect the division to continue to incur losses in our future losses  however  along with growing working capital needs as the business grows  will negatively affect our ability to generate cash 
in  our board of directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to spend up to  to repurchase shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
the maximum dollar value of shares that may yet be purchased under the share repurchase program is  we have not repurchased any shares since contractual obligations the following table presents our contractual obligations at september  in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years total debt interest expense capital leases operating leases total as of september   the liability balance for uncertain tax positions was  we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods these amounts will ultimately be settled 
holders of our  par value outstanding notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash as early as january  we also currently have outstanding  aggregate principal amount of our notes 
holders of our notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes for cash as early as january  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
following are our most critical accounting policies that affect significant areas and involve judgment and estimates 
if these estimates differ materially from actual results  the impact on the consolidated financial statements may be material 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of our products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs associated with products sold are classified as revenue 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order as evidence of an arrangement 
delivery generally occurs when product is delivered to a common carrier 
certain of our products are delivered on an fob destination basis 
we defer our revenue associated with these transactions until the product has been delivered to the customer s premises 
we also store disk drive components division inventory in vmi facilities  which are warehouses located close to the customer s manufacturing facilities 
revenue is recognized on sales from such facilities upon the transfer of title and risk of loss  following the customer s acknowledgement of the receipt of the goods 
we also enter into arrangements with customers that provide us with reimbursement for engineering services and specific program capacity to partially offset the costs of our investment 
we recognize the associated revenue over the estimated life of the program to which the services and capacity relate 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market by analyzing market conditions  current sales prices  inventory costs and inventory balances 
we are dependent on a limited number of customers and a limited number of product programs for each customer 
because our products are custom built  we typically cannot shift work in process or finished goods from customer to customer or from one program to another for a particular customer 
we evaluate inventory balances for excess quantities and obsolescence on a regular basis by analyzing backlog  estimated demand  inventory on hand  sales levels and other information 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to the lower of cost or market based on the analysis 
long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry downturn or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of long lived assets  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets will be written down based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
fair value would generally be determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows 
our impairment analysis for the second quarter of indicated that no charge for impairment was required 
based on our forecast model at that time  there was a cushion in excess of between our expected undiscounted cash flows and the carrying value of our assets 
changes in these estimates could have a material effect on the assessment of long lived assets 
at september   our forecast model confirmed the previous analysis 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb guidance on accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized based on future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we must include an expense or a benefit within the tax provision in our statement of operations 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances arise due to the uncertainty of realizing deferred tax assets 
at september   and september   we had valuation allowances of  and  respectively 
the fasb guidance requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence  using a more likely than not standard 
in making such assessments  significant weight is to be given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a company s current or previous losses are given more weight than its future outlook 
under the guidance  our three year historical cumulative loss was a significant negative factor 
this loss  combined with uncertain near term market and economic conditions  reduced our ability to rely on our projections of future taxable income in determining whether a valuation allowance was appropriate 
accordingly  we concluded that a full valuation allowance is appropriate 
we will continue to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realizable  and our valuation allowance will be adjusted accordingly  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
other matters see note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements 
inflation management believes inflation has not had a material effect on our operations or on our financial condition 
we cannot be sure that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no earnings or cash flow exposure due to market risk on our debt obligations that are subject to fixed interest rates 
interest rate changes  however  would affect the fair market value of this fixed rate debt 
at september   we had fixed rate debt of  with a fair market value of approximately  at september   we had borrowed  under the credit facility available under the revolving credit and security agreement with pnc bank 
subsequent to year end all of such borrowings had been repaid 
if we borrow additional amounts under the credit facility in the future  such amounts will be subject to cash interest  at our election  at a rate equal to either i pnc bank s alternate base rate as defined in the credit agreement plus per annum or ii libor plus per annum 
after march   such loans  if any  will be eligible to bear cash interest at a reduced rate equal to either i pnc bank s alternate base rate plus per annum or ii libor plus per annum if no defaults or events of default exist under the credit agreement 
our investing activities are guided by an investment policy  which is reviewed at least annually by our board of directors  and whose objectives are preservation and safety of capital  maintenance of necessary liquidity and maximizing of the rate of return within the stated guidelines 
our policy provides guidelines as to the maturity  concentration limits and credit quality of our investments  as well as guidelines for communication  authorized securities and other policies and procedures in connection with our investing activities 
we are exposed to various market risks and potential loss arising from changes in interest rates in connection with our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held in investment accounts
