item management discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition executive summary and note to consolidated financial statements 
item business introduction presidential life corporation is an insurance holding company that  through its wholly owned subsidiary  presidential life insurance company the insurance company  markets and sells a variety of fixed annuity  life insurance and accident and health insurance products 
we manage our business and report as a single business segment 
we are a delaware corporation founded in through the insurance company  we are licensed to market our products in all states and the district of columbia 
approximately of our sales of annuity  life insurance and accident and health products were made to individuals residing in the state of new york 
headquartered in nyack  new york  we had full time employees as of december  unless the context otherwise requires  the company  we  us  our and similar references shall mean presidential life corporation and the insurance company  collectively 
business strategy our core business strategy is to expand our individual annuity business and to increase our risk adjusted returns on invested capital by prudently managing investment spreads and investment risk 
key elements to our multiyear strategy include the following expand regional platform into national platform 
our annuity business is concentrated in the new york area primarily due to our having a new york domiciled life insurance operating company 
we are planning to expand this platform by adding a broadly licensed  non ny life insurance operating company  to be domiciled outside of new york state 
we believe that such an expansion will increase our ability to more effectively compete nationwide and enable us to offer more innovative annuity products with a competitive speed to market approach 
broaden annuity product offerings to include all four major product types 
currently our annuity product line includes guaranteed traditional fixed book value deferred and immediate annuity offerings 
we intend to increase product offerings to include indexed and market value adjusted annuities 
specifically  the increasing popularity of fixed index annuity products that allow equity and bond market participation without the risk of loss of the premium deposit presents a significant long term opportunity to grow our annuity business 
build on our distribution channels 
ppgas personal producing general agents are currently the major distributor of our annuity products 
due to our planned national expansion and broader range of annuity products  we believe that an opportunity exists to build on our distribution channels to include the larger brokerage general agents and to enhance our independent producer channel 
we also plan on recruiting mid size independent marketing organizations that will be required to meet certain specific minimum volume amounts and quality standards 
enhance investment spread capabilities 
we intend to build on our experience and expertise in managing the investment spread over a range of interest rate environments to achieve our targeted spreads and increase our risk adjusted returns on invested capital 
we intend to continue to reduce risk in the investment portfolio by reducing exposure to limited partnerships 
we redeemed a substantial amount of our hedge fund investments at year end and plan additional hedge fund redemptions 
we expect that the proceeds from these redemptions along with capital returned to the company from remaining limited partnership investments will be redeployed into more liquid securities with more predictable revenue streams and with lower capital requirements 
focus of high quality service to agents and policyholders 
we strive to continually improve the timeliness and accuracy of our service 
our internal business processes and technology platform are undergoing an extensive review with the objective being to further enhance our commitment to high quality service to our agents and policyholders 
products we offer a range of fixed annuity  life insurance and accident and health insurance products 
during  our product mix was approximately annuities  life insurance and accident and health insurance 
due to the competitive nature of the traditional term  whole life and universal life insurance business and the negative impact of that competition on our profitability  in  management decided to stop offering those traditional life insurance products 
we continue to service the in force policies and continue to issue the more profitable graded benefit life and simplified issue whole life products 
for financial statement purposes  revenues from the sale of ordinary life insurance  annuity contracts with life contingencies and accident and health insurance are treated as revenues whereas the sale of annuity contracts without life contingencies  deferred annuities and universal life insurance products are reported as additions to policyholders account balances on our balance sheet 
annuities we sell a variety of fixed annuity products including single and flexible premium deferred annuities  single premium immediate annuities and a selection of special annuities 
each of these products is designed to meet the needs of increasingly sophisticated consumers for supplemental retirement income and estate planning 
annuities currently enjoy an advantage over certain other savings mechanisms because the annuitant receives a tax deferred accrual of interest on his or her investment 
due to the prevailing low interest rate environment  industry wide demand for fixed annuity products was weak in single premium deferred annuities 
single premium deferred annuities spdas provide for a single  lump sum premium at time of issue  an accumulation period and an annuity payout period beginning at some future date 
during the accumulation period  the account value of the annuitant is credited with earnings at a current interest rate that is guaranteed for periods ranging from one to six years  at the annuitant s option  and thereafter is subject to change based on market and other conditions 
each contract also has a minimum guaranteed rate 
the accrual of interest during the accumulation period is on a tax deferred basis to the annuitant 
after the number of years specified in the annuity contract  the annuitant may elect to take the proceeds of the annuity as a single payment  a specified income for life  or a specified income for a fixed number of years 
the annuitant is permitted at any time during the accumulation period to withdraw all or part of the single premium paid plus the amount credited to his or her account 
any such withdrawal  however  typically is subject to a surrender charge during the early years of the annuity contract 
flexible premium deferred annuities 
flexible premium deferred annuities provide similar benefits to those provided by single premium products  but instead permit periodic premium payments in such amounts as the holder deems appropriate 
flexible premium deferred annuities are not available in every state 
all of our deferred annuity products provide minimum interest rate guarantees 
these minimum guaranteed rates range from to annually and the contracts except for immediate contracts discussed below are designed to permit us to change the crediting rates annually after the initial guarantee period subject to the minimum guaranteed rate 
in determining the frequency and extent of changes to the interest crediting rate  we take into account the profitability of our annuity business and its relative competitive position in the marketplace 
our deferred annuity products are designed to encourage persistency by incorporating surrender charges that exceed the cost of issuing the policy 
an annuitant may not terminate or withdraw substantial funds for periods generally ranging from one to seven years after purchase of the annuity without incurring significant penalties in the form of surrender charges 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our deferred annuity contracts in force measured by reserves are subject to surrender charges 
single premium immediate annuities 
our single premium immediate products guarantee a stream of payments  which begin within the first contract year as opposed to being deferred and continue for the life of the annuitant or for a specified period of time 
in an immediate annuity  the payment may be guaranteed for a period of time typically five to twenty years 
if the annuitant dies during the guarantee period  payments will continue to be made to the annuitant s beneficiary for the balance of the guarantee period 
immediate annuities differ from deferred annuities in that they generally provide for fixed payments that are not subject to surrender or loan 
the implicit interest rate on immediate annuities is based on market conditions that exist at the time the annuity is issued and is guaranteed for the term of the annuity 
a deferred immediate annuity sentinel was approved by the new york state insurance department nysid and was introduced in the following table summarizes annuity products in force measured by reserves  as well as certain statistical data for each of the years in the five fiscal year period ended december   in each case  as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap

annuity considerations the following table sets forth certain information with respect to our annuity considerations for each of the five fiscal years ended december   as determined in accordance with statutory accounting principles  which include as revenue the consideration from policyholders in such years other than consideration from immediate annuities without life contingencies 
the information below differs from the premiums shown on the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap in that  under gaap  consideration from single premium annuity contracts without life contingencies  universal life insurance products and deferred annuities are not reported as premium revenues  but are reported as additions to policyh older account balances  which are liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
distribution of products by gross annuity considerations for the fiscal years ended december  single premium dollars in thousands deferred immediate other annuities total annuities life insurance we offer the following life insurance products graded benefit whole life 
graded benefit life policies are designed for the upper age ie  ages in most states  substandard applicant 
depending upon age  these policies provide for a limited death benefit of the return of premium plus interest for either two or three years 
thereafter  the death benefit is limited to the face amount of the policy 
this product typically is offered with a maximum face value of  simplified issue whole life 
in  we introduced a simplified issue whole life policy for customers who would not qualify for standard risk rates  but who want immediate coverage as opposed to graded benefit life  which has a modified face amount for two to three years 
the rates are substandard based on the impairments that are deemed acceptable by the company for that risk classification 
the maximum face amount available is  and underwriting is required to approve for issue 
field underwriting by the agent is required at the time of the application 
the applicant is required to disclose medical information  which is then verified by the company to ascertain if the risk is acceptable or greater than the impairments that qualify for the product 
if the applicant is not eligible by underwriting standards  we can offer a graded benefit life policy 
underwriting rules for reinstatement of a simplified issue whole life policy must meet the same risk classification it was at issue  or the policyholder is declined reinstatement 
group life group term life insurance provided through the workplace provides financial coverage in the event of premature death 
ad d insurance  as well as coverage for spouses  children or domestic partners  are also available 
insurance consists primarily of renewable term life insurance with the amount of coverage provided being either a flat amount  a multiple of the employee s earnings  or a combination of the two 
other 
other life insurance products in force  but no longer being issued  include universal life  whole life and term life 
universal life policies  both flexible premium and single premium  are interest sensitive products  which typically provide the insured with non participating ie  non dividend paying life insurance with a cash value 
current interest is credited to the policy s cash value based primarily upon prevailing interest rates but not less than the guaranteed rate specified in the policy 
whole life policies are products that provide the insured with life insurance with a guaranteed cash value 
typically  a fixed premium  which costs more than comparable term coverage when the policyholder is younger  but less than comparable term coverage as the policyholder grows older  is paid over a period of years 
whole life insurance products combine insurance protection with a savings plan that gradually increases over a period of time  which the policyholder may borrow against 
term life policies are products that provide insurance protection if the insured dies during the time period specified in the policy 
no cash value is built up 
term life products provide the maximum benefit for the lowest initial premium outlay 
the company continues to maintain its life insurance in force business and this may require additional underwriting ie  reinstatements  re entries and conversions 
in that regard  the insurance has adopted and follows detailed  uniform underwriting procedures designed to assess and quantify insurance risks 
to the extent that a policyholder eligible for reinstatement  reentry or conversion does not meet the company s underwriting standards at the standard risk classifications  the company may offer to issue a classified  substandard or impaired risk policy for a risk adjusted premium amount rather than declining the application 
the amount of the insurance company s impaired risk insurance in force in proportion to the total amount of its individual life insurance in force was approxim ately at december  insurance policies in force the following table sets forth universal  whole and term life insurance policies in force  as well as certain statistical data for each of the five years ended december  dollars in thousands beginning of year universal whole term total sales and additions universal whole term total terminations death surrenders and conversions lapses other total end of year universal whole term total total reinsurance ceded total insurance in force at end of year net of reinsurance includes graded benefit life insurance products accident and health insurance new york statutory disability benefits dbl are short term disability contracts issued to employers of one or more employees in new york state 
the benefit must be equal or better  in every respect  to the minimum benefits defined in the new york disability benefits law 
the minimum benefit allowed is of the weekly earnings to a maximum of commencing on the th day of non occupation disabilities for a maximum of weeks in any week period for any one disability 
with few exceptions  employers are required to provide this coverage to their new york employees 
ancillary products we offer ancillary accident and health lines designed to further protect against risks to which our core customer is typically exposed 
these products combined contributed only to our total premiums in  however  we are expecting this percentage to increase in the majority of these products  excluding dental  is reinsured and the administration of these products is handled by a third party administrator 
our ancillary product offerings include the following medical stop loss medical stop loss coverage is sold to employers not individual employees to cover their liabilities as incurred in the administration of self funded medical plans 
these are plans that are governed by erisa 
the employer does not buy a fully insured plan from a carrier  but instead opts to pay the benefits for its medical plan itself 
the parameters of these benefits are spelled out in a plan document that is disseminated to employees 
the employer then purchases stop loss coverage to insure it against claims in excess of contractually designated amounts 
the coverage purchased by the employer will typically cover the risk that a claim on an individual employee exceeds a certain level and the risk that the overall claims for the plan less whatever amount is covered under the specific deductible exceeds a given level 
both types of plans generally have a maximum reimbursement level and are reinsured at approximately 
group dental in the third quarter of  the company began providing group dental insurance 
dental benefit plans provide funding for necessary or elective dental care 
this policy provides dental coverage and is available only in new york to employer groups 
coverage is provided through a preferred provider organization ppo or out of network arrangement in which this coverage is subject to deductibles  coinsurance and annual or lifetime maximums 
individual impaired risk disability the individual substandard disability product provides disability income insurance 
individually underwritten policy for the substandard risk market  this was designed for individuals that may have been declined for normal disability coverage with another carrier 
hospital indemnity products this is a limited benefit policy that provides a combination of hospital indemnity and limited medical surgical benefits  available to persons and their dependents 
optional accidental death and dismemberment ad d  dental or vision benefits are offered 
our hospital indemnity products provide a daily benefit ranging from to  per day for medically necessary inpatient confinements up to a maximum number of days and a limited dollar benefits for treatment of medical conditions 
the policy does not cover all medical expenses 
accident products this is a limited benefit policy not intended to cover all medical expenses 
our accident emergency room policy provides accident only benefits for accident dental medical and ad d with an accident sickness emergency room benefit 
subject to deductibles  limits and maximums  the policy will pay the selected benefit amount ranging from  to  per injury sickness 
marketing and distribution the insurance company is licensed to market insurance products in all states and the district of columbia 
the insurance company distributes our annuity and life insurance products through  independent general agents of which are located in new york state 
these general agents  in turn  distribute the insurance company s products through their  licensed insurance agents or brokers  most of whom also distribute similar products marketed by other insurance companies 
we believe that we offer innovative products and quality service and that our product commission rates are competitive 
the new york state department of insurance nysid regulates general agent commission rates 
the independent general agent system is our primary product distribution system 
management believes that the general agent distribution system provides cost advantages to us because we incur minimal fixed costs associated with recruiting  training and maintaining agents via our general agents 
therefore  a substantial portion of the costs normally associated with product distribution is variable 
distribution costs rise and fall with the level of business 
we utilize many general agents to distribute our products and therefore we are not dependent on any one general agent for a substantial amount of our business 
on the other hand  independent general agents and their licensed agents and brokers are not captive to the company 
management believes that interest crediting rates  general agent product commission levels  annuity and life product features  company support services and perceived company financial stability help determine our competitive position at any given point in time and influence general agents and their licensed agents and brokers to distribute our products 
generally  we issue annuity contracts along with the general agent s commission within two business days after application receipt 
we also provide general agent support by providing direct access to the insurance company s senior executives 
annuity contract and life insurance policyholders may access information regarding their individual holdings via the company s website or toll free telephone number 
our top ten general agents  as measured by combined annuity and life premiums  accounted for approximately of our sales in no single general agent accounted for more than 
management does not believe that the loss of any single distribution source would have a material adverse impact on our business 
however  the simultaneous loss of several distribution sources would diminish our product distribution and reduce sales unless these sources were timely replaced 
to guard against this contingency  we continuously recruit new independent general agents 
policy claims individual life claims are received and reviewed by claims examiners at our home office 
the initial review of claims includes verification that coverage is in force and that the claim is not subject to exclusion under the policy 
birth and death certificates are basic requirements 
medical records and investigative reports are ordered for contestable claims 
reinsurance we follow the usual industry practice of reinsuring ceding portions of our life insurance and medical stop loss risks with other companies  a practice that permits us to write policies in amounts larger than the risk we are willing to retain and to obtain commissions on the insurance ceded and thereby reduce our net commission expense 
the maximum amount of individual life insurance we normally retain on any one life is  per policy and  per life 
we cede primarily on an automatic basis  under which risks are ceded to a reinsurer on specific blocks of business where the underlying risks meet certain predetermined criteria  and on a facultative basis  under which the reinsurer s prior approval is required on each risk reinsured 
the maximum retention of the group medical stop loss business varies  but typically we cede to on a quota share basis 
use of reinsurance does not discharge an insurer from liability on the insurance ceded 
an insurer is required to pay the full amount of its insurance obligations regardless of whether it is entitled or able to receive payments from the reinsurer 
at december   of the approximately billion of the company s individual life insurance in force  we had ceded to reinsurer s approximately million 
the principal reinsurance companies of individual life policies with whom we did business at december  were transamerica international re  ltd 
not rated by am best and swiss re life and health america  inc am best rating of a excellent 
competition we operate in a highly competitive environment 
there are numerous insurance companies  banks  securities brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products  annuities and other investments that compete with us  and many of these companies are more highly rated and have substantially greater resources than we do 
management believes that the principal competitive factors in the sale of annuity and life insurance products are product features  commission structure  perceived stability of the insurer  claims paying rating and service 
many other insurance and financial services companies are capable of competing for sales in our target markets 
management believes that our ability to compete is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to retain and attract independent general agents to market our products and to successfully develop competitive  profitable products 
management believes that we have good relationships with our agents  that we have an adequate variety of products approved for issuance and that we generally are competitive within the industry in all applicable areas

the portfolio is diversified  with individual holdings of primarily investment grade companies 
given their large and continuing need for additional capital  public utilities are sensitive to a general rise in overall interest rates 
however  regulatory agencies generally provide regulatory support in increasing interest rate environments because of the nature of utility service

in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments ie  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity  which except for hedge fund investments  may be mitigated by our ability to receive quarterly distributions of partnership earnings

these withdrawals are subject to a holdback of  with final distributions pending the completion of the partnership s annual audit 
one of these partnerships contain private special investments  which equal approximately of its carrying value  that may also be excluded from the withdrawal process and subject to liquidation at a later date 
one of the hedge funds had its assets located at the prime brokerage unit of lehman brothers international europe lbi e  located in the united kingdom 
since september  when lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy  the assets were frozen and the claims to such assets are subject to the resolution of the bankruptcy proceedings 
due to the complexities surrounding the lbie proceedings  the company cannot forecast with any certainty when it will be resolved 
on december   the company liquidated four hedge fund investments at market value except for approximately  of private special investments held by one of the liquidated funds 
approximately of the company s investment portfolio in limited partnerships is involved in distressed asset investments 
these limited partnerships take positions in debt and equity securities  loans originated by banks and other liabilities of financially troubled companies 
investments in companies undergoing debt restructurings  which by their nature have a high degree of financial uncertainty  may be senior  unsecured or subordinated indebtedness 
this makes such underlying investments particularly sensitive to interest rate increases  which could affect the ability of the borrower to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its fixed charges 
approximately of the company s limited partnership portfolio generally invests in real estate assets  real estate joint ventures and real estate operating companies 
these partnerships seek to achieve significant rates of return by targeting investments that provide a strategic or competitive advantage and are priced at levels that the general partner believes to be attractive

despite earning positive returns on its limited partnership investments and their substantial contributions to the company s profits in the years prior to the very significant market and economic downturn from to  the company s limited partnership investments have performed poorly since late  contributing significant pressure on our net investment income and net income 
in addition  the ratings agencies that evaluate the company s claims paying ability generally have an unfavorable view of such investments  which the company believes has had a negative effect on the insurance company s am best ratings 
as such  although the limited partnersh ip investments have historically contributed substantially to the company s profits  they have not enabled the company to achieve the ratings upgrades that might be expected to accompany our profitable performance 
this factor is continually monitored by company s management in determining whether and to what extent the company will continue to invest in limited partnerships at current  reduced or increased levels 
the company has not made any new commitments to limited partnership investments since april such decisions will be subject to the approval of the chief investment officer and the investment committee and the review and approval by the board of directors of the insurance company and the company  as the case may be 
there can be no assurance that we will again achieve the same level of positive returns on our investments in limited partnerships that we achieved in years prior to the downturn or that we will achieve any returns on such investments at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will receive a return of all or any portion of our current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure to receive the return of a material portion of our capital investments in limited partnerships would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
other investments as of december   the company s investment portfolio included approximately million invested in preferred stock  and approximately million invested in common stock

in addition  many transactions require prior notification to or approval of the superintendent of insurance of the state of new york the superintendent 
in addition  insurance regulators periodically examine the insurance company s financial condition  adherence to statutory accounting practices and compliance with the insurance department s rules and regulations 
as part of their routine regulatory oversight process  the new york state insurance department nysid conducts detailed examinations of the books  records and accounts of the insurance company every three years 
the insurance company s most recently completed examination covered the three year period ending december  and the nysid issued its final report on march  the nysid s review did not reveal any issues that materially affected the company s financial condition or that deviated from the new york insurance law  nysid regulations and circular letters or the opera ting rules of the company 
the nysid indicated that it would continue to review the pricing methodologies and assumptions of our products in light of new york s self support regulations  which state that life insurance companies domiciled or conducting business in the state of new york are prohibited from selling insurance products that are priced with an expected loss based on reasonable actuarial assumptions 
the nysid is currently conducting an examination of the insurance company for the three year period ending december  and a final report is expected in statutory reporting practices the insurance company prepares its statutory financial statements in accordance with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the nysid 
the nysid has adopted the provisions of the naic s statutory accounting practices sap as the basis for its statutory reporting practices 
sap is used to prepare statutory financial statements for regulatory filings of stock life insurance companies differ in certain instances from gaap 
the following are some of the major differences between sap and gaap sap  unlike gaap  utilizes asset valuation reserves and interest maintenance reserves  which are intended to stabilize surplus from fluctuations in the value of the investment portfolio 
future policy benefits and policyholders account balances under sap differ from gaap due to differences between actuarial assumptions and reserving methodologies 
certain policy acquisition costs  such as commissions  sales inducements and certain expenses related to policy issuance and underwriting are expensed as incurred under sap  but are deferred under gaap and amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies or based on past and projected profits to achieve a matching of revenues and expenses 
under gaap  deferred federal income taxes provide for temporary differences which are recognized in the consolidated financial statements in a different period than for federal income tax purposes 
deferred taxes are also recognized under sap  however  there are limitations as to the amount of deferred tax assets that may be reported as admitted assets 
under sap  the change in the deferred taxes is recorded in surplus  rather than as a component of income tax expense 
under sap  the company s portfolio of debt securities are recorded at amortized cost  except for securities that are in or near default  that are reported at fair value 
under gaap  debt securities are carried at amortized cost or fair value based on their classification as either held to maturity or available for sale 
certain assets  such as furniture and equipment  agents debit balances  and prepaid expenses  are not admissible under sap but are recognized under gaap 
under sap  premiums from universal life and deferred annuities are recognized as premiums when received 
under gaap  the premiums received are recorded as an increase in liability for policyholder account balances and revenues are recognized primarily when the policy administration fee portion of premiums and surrender charges are received 
regulation of dividends and other payments from the insurance company the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries 
as a holding company with no other business operations  its primary sources of cash needed to meet its obligations  including dividend payments on its common stock  are rent from its real estate  income from its investments and dividends from the insurance company 
the insurance company is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the maximum amount of payments  including loans or cash advances  that it may make to the company without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
under new york law  the insurance company is permitted  without prior regulatory clearance  to pay a dividend to the company as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its statutory surplus as of the end of the immediately preceding calendar year  or ii its statutory net gain after tax from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year 
any dividend in excess of such amount is subject to approval by the superintendent 
the superintendent has broad discretion in determining whether the financial condition of a stock life insurance company would support the payment of such dividends to its stockholders 
the nysid has establishe d informal guidelines for such determinations 
the guidelines focus on  among other things  an insurer s overall financial condition and profitability under statutory accounting practices  which  as discussed above  differ in certain respects from accounting principles used in financial statements prepared in conformity with gaap 
in  the insurance company paid million in dividends to the company 
in  the insurance company will be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend of up to million to the company without prior regulatory clearance 
however  there can be no assurance that this level of dividend payments will continue to be permitted in future periods 
accordingly  the company cannot provide assurance that the insurance company will have adequate statutory earnings to support payment of dividends to the company in an amount sufficient to fund the company s cash requirements  including the payment of dividends to our shareholders  or that the superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that the insurance company must submit for the superintendent s consideration 
investment reserves asset valuation reserve 
statutory accounting practices require a life insurance company to maintain an asset valuation reserve avr to absorb realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on a portion of an insurer s fixed income securities and equity securities 
the avr is required to stabilize statutory surplus from fluctuations in the market value of bonds  stocks  mortgages  real estate and other long term investments 
the maximum avr is calculated based on the application of various factors that are applied to the assets in the insurer s portfolio 
the avr captures credit related realized and unrealized capital gains and losses on such a ssets 
each year the amount of an insurer s avr will fluctuate as the investment portfolio changes and capital gains and losses are absorbed by the avr 
to adjust for such changes over time  contributions must be made to the avr in an aggregate amount equal to of the difference between the maximum avr as calculated and the actual avr 
these contributions may slow the rate of growth in or reduce the insurance company s surplus 
the impact of the avr on the insurance company s surplus depends in part on the future composition of the insurance company s investment portfolio 
interest maintenance reserve 
the interest maintenance reserve imr captures capital gains and losses net of taxes on fixed income investments primarily bonds and mortgage loans resulting from interest rate changes  which are amortized into net income over the estimated remaining periods to maturity of the investments sold 
the extent of the impact of the imr depends on the amount of future capital gains and losses on fixed maturity investments resulting from interest rate changes 
naic iris ratios the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and primarily is intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies industry ratios and specifies normal ranges for each ratio 
the iris ratios were designed to advise state insurance regulators of significant changes in an insurance company s product mix  large reinsurance transactions  increases or decreases in premiums received and certain other changes in operations 
these changes need not result from any problems with an insurance company  but merely indicate changes in certain ratios outside ranges defined as normal by the naic 
when an insurance company has four or more ratios falling outside normal ranges  state regulators may  but are not obligated to  inquire of the company regarding the nature of the company s business to determine the reasons for the ratios being outside the normal range 
no regulatory significance results from being out of the normal range on fewer than four of the ratios 
for the year ended december   the insurance company had one ratio that fell outside the normal range 
the change in premium ratio fell outside of the normal range due to the significant decrease in our annuity premiums 
annuity sales decreased by over million as a direct result of the low interest rate environment 
riskbased capital under the naic risk based capital rbc formula  insurance companies must calculate and report information under a risk based capital formula 
the standards require the computation of a risk based capital amount which is compared to a company s actual total adjusted capital 
the computation involves applying factors to various financial data to address four primary risks asset default  adverse insurance experience  disintermediation and external events 
this information is intended to permit insurance regulators to identify and require remedial action for inadequately capitalized insurance companies  but is not designed to rank adequately capitalized companies 
the naic formula provides for four levels of potential involvement by state regulators for inadequately capitalized insurance companies  ranging from a requirement for an insurance company to submit a plan to improve its capital company action level to regulatory control of the insurance company mandatory control level 
at december   the insurance company s company action level was million and the mandatory control level was million 
the insurance company s adjusted capital at december  and was million and million  respectively  which exceeds all four action levels 
the company s rbc ratio as of december  and was and  respectively 
assessments against insurers most jurisdictions require insurance companies transacting business in that jurisdiction to participate in guaranty funds that compensate policyholders of insolvent insurance companies 
insurers authorized to transact business in these jurisdictions generally are subject to assessments based on annual direct premiums written in that jurisdiction 
these assessments may be deferred or forgiven under most guaranty laws if they would threaten an insurer s insolvency and  in certain instances  may be offset against future state premium taxes 
the amount of these assessments against the insurance company in and prior years have not been material 
however  the amount and timing of any future assessment against the insurance company under these laws cannot be reasonably estimated and are beyond the control of the company and the insurance company 
as such  no reasonable estimate of such assessments can be made 
federal regulation although the federal government generally does not directly regulate the insurance business  federal initiatives often have an impact on the business in a variety of ways 
current and any future federal measures that may significantly affect the insurance business include limitations on antitrust immunity  minimum solvency requirements  and the removal of barriers restricting banks from engaging in the insurance and mutual fund business 
in particular  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act of dodd frank act  among other things  established the federal insurance office fio within the us treasury 
under this law  re gulations will need to be created for the fio to fulfill its mandate to focus on systemic risk oversight 
the fio is required to gather information regarding the insurance industry and report to congress a plan to modernize and improve insurance regulation in the us at this time  it is difficult to predict the extent the dodd frank act  or any resulting regulations  will impact the company s operations 
environmental considerations as an owner and operator of real property  the company is subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
inherent in such ownership and operation is also the risk that there may be potential environmental liabilities and costs in connection with any required remediation of such properties 
we cannot provide assurance that unexpected environmental liabilities will not arise 
however  based on information currently available to management  we believe that any costs associated with environmental regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
enterprise risk management under the current economic environment  the company s enterprise risk management erm program has become more critical in supporting executive decision making regarding capital management  investment decisions and other key decisions  contributing to the preservation and enhancement of shareholder value 
in  the company adopted an erm policy as a methodology and process for the company to actively manage risks 
management adopted the use of robust capital modeling to help optimize executives key decisions 
management has developed a structured erm framework in order to identify  monitor and mitigate major risks 
status on key risk management initiatives  as well as risk dashboard reports  is provided to the board of directors quarterly 
the framework also allows the company to clarify corporate governance structure  ensure clear accountability and identify any potential gaps that may emerge in current risk management practices 
ratings many insurance buyers  agents and brokers use the ratings assigned by am best and other agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies from which they are considering purchasing insurance 
in may  the am best company affirmed the financial strength rating of b good and issuer credit rating icr of bbb good for the insurance company and the icr of bb fair for presidential life corporation 
the ratings have been assigned a stable outlook 
these ratings were derived from an in depth evaluation of our balance sheets  operating performance and business profile

am best ratings are intended to provide an independent opinion of an insurer s ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not an evaluation directed at investors 
ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position in the insurance and financial services marketplace 
there can be no assurance that the company s or the insurance company s ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
in the event the ratings are downgraded  the level of revenues or the prospects of the insurance company s business may be adversely impacted

item a 
risk factors the following are certain risk factors that could affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 
these risk factors should also be considered in connection with evaluating the forward looking statements contained in this form k 
our business has been  and may continue to be  negatively impacted by recent adverse economic and market conditions 
our business has been adversely affected by the economic and capital markets downturns over the past two years 
these downturns have been characterized by higher unemployment  lower family income  lower consumer spending and generally poor investment returns 
until the us economy improves  our business will continue to be negatively impacted 
in this type of economic environment  among other things  consumers may refrain from purchasing our annuity products  we may experience a higher incidence of claims and lapses or surrender of policies  and our policyholders may choose to defer or stop paying insurance premiums 
each of these occurrences  and the occurrence of other negative effects which we may not anticipate resulting from the economic downturn or from slow economic growth  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
because our financial condition and operating results are significantly affected by the performance of our investment portfolio  we may be adversely affected by changes in bond yields and interest rates 
our financial condition and operating results are heavily affected by the performance of our investment portfolio 
most of our portfolio is invested in fixed income securities which are valued on our balance sheet at market value 
the market value of fixed income securities generally moves in the opposite direction of the market yields of bonds bond prices decline when their yields rise 
bond yields may rise or fall in response to market expectations of future interest rates and as a result of changes in the market valuation of the credit worthiness of the relevant issuers 
bond yields were volatile during  which impacted our financial results 
changes in bond yields also affect the rate at which funds are reinvested and this may have an adverse effect on investment income and consequently on our results of operations 
significant increases or decreases in market interest rates can materially and adversely affect the profitability of our products  our ability to earn predictable returns  the fair value of our investments and the reported value of shareholders equity 
a rise in interest rates generally will increase the unrealized loss position of our investment portfolio 
the value of long duration bonds in our investment portfolio is also sensitive to interest rate changes 
bond yields and interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary policies  domestic and international economic and political conditions and other factors beyond our control 
although we attempt to manage the risks of investing in a changing interest rate environment  we may not be able to mitigate interest rate sensitivity effectively 
our interest rate strategy includes maintaining a diversified investment portfolio emphasizing higher rated securities 
despite our mitigation efforts  a significant increase in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the returns of our investment portfolio and our results of operations 
deterioration in the public debt and equity markets would likely lead to losses in our investment portfolio  which would negatively impact our financial results 
although our investment policies stress diversification of risks  conservation of principal and liquidity through conservative investment guidelines  our investments are subject to general economic conditions  market risks and fluctuations  as well as to risks inherent in particular securities 
prolonged and severe disruptions in the public debt and equity markets  including  among other things  widening of credit spreads  bankruptcies  defaults  and significant ratings downgrades  may put our investments at risk 
market volatility can make it difficult to value certain of our securities if trading becomes less frequent 
depending on market conditions  we could incur substantial additional realized and unrealized investment losses in future periods 
separately  the occurrence of large claims may force us to liquidate securities at an inopportune time  which may cause us to realize capital losses 
large investment losses could decrease our asset base  ther eby affecting our ability to underwrite new business 
additionally  such losses would have a material adverse impact on our equity  business and financial strength 
our investment portfolio includes below investment grade or unrated securities that have a higher degree of credit or default risk 
default losses could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our investment portfolio is primarily invested in high quality  investment grade securities 
however  a small portion of the portfolio is invested in below investment grade or unrated securities 
at december   below investment grade or unrated securities comprised approximately of our investment portfolio 
these securities have a higher degree of credit or default risk and are much less liquid than the rest of our portfolio 
these securities may also be less liquid in times of economic weakness or market disruptions 
while we have in place investment guidelines to monitor the credit risk and liquidity of our invested assets  it is possible that  in periods of prolonged economic weakness  we may experience default losses in our portfolio 
this may result in a reduction of net income and capital  adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations 
our investments in limited partnerships have a significant impact on our results of operations 
as of december   approximately million of the company s investment portfolio consisted of interests in over limited partnerships managed by various general partners  which are engaged in a variety of investment strategies  including real estate  infrastructure  debt restructurings  oil and gas and merchant banking 
historically  the returns on these limited partnership investments  although representing a small percentage of our investment assets  have had a disproportionately large impact on our results of operations 
given the significant impact of our limited partnership investments on our total revenues  the performance of our limited partnership investments has a significant impact on our results of operations 
in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments ie  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve the same level of returns on our investments in limited partnerships that we achieved in the years prior to the downturn or that we will achieve any returns on such investments at all 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will receive a return of all or any portion of our current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure to receive the return of a material portion of our investments in limited partnerships could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we face competition from companies that have greater financial resources  a broader array of products  higher ratings and stronger financial performance than us  which may impair our ability to retain existing customers  attract new customers and maintain our profitability and financial strength 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
there are numerous insurance companies  banks  securities brokerage firms and other financial intermediaries marketing insurance products  annuities  and other investments that compete with us 
management believes that our ability to compete is dependent upon  among other things  our ability to retain and attract independent general agents to market our products and our ability to successfully develop competitive  profitable products  which includes paying competitive interest rates on our products 
if our competitors are more successful than we are at offering compelling products and paying competitive rates  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
because we are a holding company with no direct operations  the inability of our principal subsidiary  the insurance company  to pay dividends to us in sufficient amounts would harm our ability to meet our obligations 
we are a holding company and we have no direct operations 
our principal asset is the capital stock of the insurance company 
our ability to fund overall operations  pay dividends to shareholders and pay corporate expenses depends primarily on the ability of the insurance company to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us 
under new york laws and regulations  the insurance company may pay dividends to us without prior approval of nysid up to a certain threshold  or must receive prior approval of nysid to pay a dividend if such dividends  along with all other dividends paid within the preceding consecutive months exceed the statutory limitation 
the current statutory limitation is the lesser of of the statutory surplus  as shown on its last annual statement on file with the commissioner or the insurer s statutory net gain from operations for the p rior calendar year 
in addition  the ability of the insurance company to pay dividends and advances or repayment of funds to us is restricted by laws requiring insurance companies to hold a specified amount of minimum reserves in order to meet future obligations on their outstanding policies 
these regulations specify that the minimum reserves shall be calculated to be sufficient to meet future obligations  after giving consideration to future required premiums to be received  and are based on certain specified mortality and morbidity tables  interest rates and methods of valuation  which are subject to change 
in order to meet its claims paying obligations  the insurance company regularly monitors its reserves to ensure that it holds sufficient amounts to cover actual or expected contract and claims payments 
at times  we may determine that reserves in excess of the minimum may be needed to ensure sufficiency 
changes in these laws can constrain the ability of the insurance company to pay dividends or to advance or repay funds to us in sufficient amounts and at times necessary to meet our corporate expenses 
regulatory  accounting or tax changes may affect the cost of  or demand for  our products or services 
our insurance business is subject to comprehensive regulation and supervision throughout the united states by both state and federal regulators 
the primary purpose of state regulation of the insurance business is to protect contract owners  and not necessarily to protect other constituencies such as creditors or shareholders 
state insurance regulators  state attorneys general  the national association of insurance commissioners  the securities and exchange commission sec and the financial industry regulatory authority finra continually reexamine existing laws and regulations and may impose changes in the future 
changes in federal legislation and administra tive policies in areas such as employee benefit plan regulation  financial services regulation  and federal taxation could lessen the advantages of certain of our products as compared to competing products  or possibly result in the surrender of some existing contracts and policies or reduced sales of new products and  therefore  could reduce our profitability 
the adoption of new laws or regulations  enforcement actions or litigation  whether or not involving the company  could influence the manner in which we distribute our insurance products  which could have an adverse effect on us 
different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
generally accepted accounting principles are complex  continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us  our independent registered public accounting firm and the sec 
such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances 
differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
downgrades in our claims paying ability  financial strength or credit ratings may increase our future cost of capital and reduce new sales and increase policy surrenders and withdrawals 
financial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies 
a downgrade  or the potential for such a downgrade  of any of the ratings for the company could have a number of adverse effects on our business  including materially increase the number of annuity contract surrenders and withdrawals  result in the termination of relationships with broker dealers  banks  agents  wholesalers  and other distributors of the company products and services  and reduce new sales of annuity contracts or increase the minimum interest rate the company may be required to pay under new annuity contracts 
any of these consequences could adversely affect the company profitability and financial condition 
if our estimated gross profits change significantly from initial expectations we may be required to expense our deferred policy acquisition costs in an accelerated manner  which would reduce our profitability 
deferred policy acquisition costs represent costs that vary with and primarily relate to the acquisition of new business 
these costs are capitalized when incurred and are amortized over the life of the contracts 
current amortization of these costs is generally in proportion to expected gross profits from interest margins and  to a lesser extent  from surrender charges 
unfavorable experience with regard to expected expenses  investment returns  mortality or withdrawals may cause acceleration of the amortization of these costs resulting in an increase of expenses and lower profitability 
changes in rating agency policies or practices could result in ratings changes unrelated to the company s business 
rating organizations assign ratings based upon numerous factors 
while most of the factors relate to the rated company  some of the factors relate to the views of the rating organization  general economic conditions  and circumstances outside the rated company control 
in addition  rating organizations may employ different models and formulas to assess financial strength of a rated company  and from time to time rating organizations have  in their discretion  altered the models 
changes to the models  general economic conditions  or circumstances outside the company control could impact a rating organization judgment and the subsequent rating it assigns the company 
the company cannot predict what actions rating organizations may take  or what actions it may be required to take in response to the actions of rating organizations  which could adversely affect the company 
we rely on general agents and agents who are independent from the company for the distribution of our products 
the independent general agent system is our primary product distribution system 
independent general agents and agents are not captive to the company 
management believes that interest crediting rates  general agent product commission levels  annuity and life product features  company support services and perceived company financial stability help determine our competitive nature at any given point in time and influence general agents and their agents to distribute our products 
the insurance company s top ten general agents  as measured by combined annuity and life premiums  accounted for approximately of our sales in no single general agent or agent accounted for more than of total sales 
the simultaneous loss of several distribution sources would diminish our product distribution and reduce sales and could have an adverse material i mpact on our business unless these sources are timely replaced 
a failure in our operational systems or infrastructure could impair our liquidity  disrupt our businesses  damage our reputation and cause losses 
shortcomings or failures in our internal processes  people or systems could lead to impairment of our liquidity  financial loss  disruption of our businesses  liability to clients  regulatory intervention or reputational damage 
for example  our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  a large number of transactions 
the transactions we process have become increasingly complex and often must adhere to client specific guidelines  as well as legal and regulatory standards 
our financial  accounting  data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control  adversely affecting our ability to process these transactions 
despite the contingency plans and facilities we have in place  our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses 
our operations rely on the secure processing  storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks 
although we take protective measures and endeavor to modify them as circumstances warrant  our computer systems  software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access  computer viruses or other malicious code and other events that could have a security impact 
if one or more of such events occur  it could potentially jeopardize our or our clients confidential and other information processed and stored in  and transmitted through  our computer systems and networks  or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations  which could result in significant losses or reputational damage 
we may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabil ities or other exposures  and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us 
our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees 
our performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals 
competition in the financial services industry for qualified employees is intense 
our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees  an inability to do so may impact our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or remediate inefficiencies 
discrepancies between actual claims experience and assumptions used in setting prices for our products would have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we establish liabilities for amounts payable under life insurance policies  accident and health insurance policies and annuity contracts 
generally  these amounts are payable over a long period of time and the profitability of the products is dependent on the pricing 
principal assumptions used in pricing policies and in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are investment returns  mortality  expenses and persistency 
the reserves reflected in the company consolidated financial statements are based upon the company best estimates of mortality  persistency  expenses and investment income  with appropriate provisions for adverse statistical deviation and the use of the net level premium method for all non interest sensitive products 
while we historically have not experienced significant adverse deviations from our assumptions  there can be no guarantee that future estimates and assumptions will not significantly dev iate from actual results 
our business may be adversely affected if the decline in annuity contracts in force were to continue for an extended period of time the declining trend in annuity in force primarily reflects unusually large volumes of business written in thru these contracts started to come off surrender charge at the end of  through the end of  at a relatively large expected surrender rate 
in  annuity surrenders  death claims and policy lapses outpaced new sales causing a slight decline in total annuity in force see chart on page 
the company believes that surrenders and death claim activity combined with the challenging low interest rate environment for annuity sales may cause total annuities in force to fall 
our system of internal control ensures the accuracy or completeness of our disclosures and a loss of public confidence in the quality of our internal controls or disclosures could have a negative impact on us 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to provide an annual report on our internal control over financial reporting  including an assessment as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
we are also required to have our auditors opine on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
we have discovered  and may in the future discover material weaknesses in our internal control that need remediation 
if we determine that our remediation has been ineffective  or we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  we could be subjected to additional regulatory scrutiny  future delays in filing our financial statements and a loss of public confidence in the reliability of our financial statements  which could have a negative impact on our liquidity  access to capital markets and financial condition

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included under item of this form k 
explanatory note regarding restatement this form k reflects the restatement of the company s consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and to apply the fair value method of accounting for investments in limited partnerships in which we have less than a interest and do not have influence over the operating and financial policies of the partnership  and to apply the equity method of accounting where we have either a or greater interest  or less than a interest but with respect to which partnership we have more than virtually no influence over the operating and financial policies of the partnership 
the restatement primarily impacts the net investment income  change in deferred policy acquisition costs and provision benefit for income taxes amounts in the statement of income and the limited partnerships investments  deferred policy acquisition costs  deferred income tax asset and shareholders equity amounts in the balance sheet 
historically  the company applied the equity method of accounting based primarily on actual cash distributions from or contributions to the limited partnerships 
each quarter  the company recorded cash distributions either as income loss or return of capital  as appropriate 
subsequent to the end of the fiscal year  upon receipt of the schedule k s and annual audited gaap basis financial statements provided by the limited partnerships  the company would record changes in market values of the limited partnerships as a component of equity in other comprehensive income or loss  the company would also record its allocable share of undistributed earnings losses  recognized by the limited partnerships during the preceding year  on its income statement as a component of consolidated net income 
the sec informed the company in march that it believed we erred in our application of the equity method under asc topic  i investments equity method and joint ventures 
as a result  we concluded that  i under the equity method  the company should record its share of investee earnings  whether realized or unrealized  as a component of consolidated net income in each quarterly and annual period  and ii certain qualitative factors previously used by the company to assess its level of influence with respect to the partnerships should not  in fact  be considered in determining whether to use the equity method  rather than the fair value method 
the company now accounts for its limited partnership investments as follows where consolidation is not appropriate  the company applies the equity method of accounting consistent with asc  investments equity method and joint ventures  to limited partnerships in which the company holds either a a five percent or greater interest or b less than a five percent interest  but with respect to which partnership the company has more than virtually no influence over the operating or financial policies of the limited partnership 
the company records realized and unrealized earnings or losses of the limited partnerships as equity in earnings loss each period 
generally  the company records its share of its earnings using a three month lag 
the company applies the fair value method of accounting consistent with asc  financial services insurance  to those limited partnerships in which the company holds less than a five percent interest and does not have more than virtually no influence over the operating or financial policies of the limited partnership 
the company recognizes the unrealized change in fair value of a partnership interest as a component of equity other comprehensive income or loss each period and recognizes distributed gains and losses in realized gains losses each period 
the company considers certain qualitative factors in assessing whether it has more than virtually no influence for partnership interests of less than five percent

our revenues are derived primarily from premiums received from the sale of annuity contracts and life  accident and health products  and from gains net of losses from our investment portfolio 
under gaap  our revenues from the sale of whole life insurance products and annuity contracts with life contingencies are treated differently from our revenues from the sale of annuity contracts without life contingencies  deferred annuities and universal life insurance products 
premiums from the sale of whole life insurance products and life contingent annuities are reported as premium income on our income statement 
premiums from the sale of deferred annuities  universal life insurance products and annuities without life contingencies are not reported as revenues  but rather are reported as additions to policyholders account balances on our balance sheet 
for these products  revenues are recognized over time in the form of policy fee income  surrender charges and mortality and other charges deducted from policyholders account balances 
the profitability of our individual annuities  individual life insurance and group accident and health products depends largely on the size of our in force book of business  the adequacy of product pricing and underwriting discipline  and the efficiency of our claim and expense management 
as described under ratings and regulation  the company s business is substantially affected by capital ratios and their impact on the company s ratings 
insurance sales are being made with a greater selectivity based on increased profit level requirements for new business 
we have determined that the level of competition in the sale of traditional and universal life insurance products has made it very difficult for smaller insurance companies to participate in that business in a profitable way 
accordingly  under th e current market conditions  we are not engaged in the sale of traditional and universal life policies 
unless specifically stated otherwise  all references to  and refer to our fiscal years ended  or the dates  as the context requires  december   december  and december   respectively

certain factors that may affect our business there are numerous factors  some of which are outside our control  which could have a material impact on our business 
we have described these factors in detail under the heading risk factors 
certain of these factors  which include market conditions  legal and regulatory changes  operational risk and interest rate risk  have a particular impact on our business market conditions 
like all companies  we are affected by the general state of financial markets and economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
the pressures related to the recent recession and slow recovery  coupled with the significant dislocation in the capital markets during late and have resulted in a historically difficult business environment and the ability to obtain desired returns on the investment portfolio  without exposing the company to excess risk  has never been more challenging 
legal and regulatory risk 
as an insurance company  we are subject to substantial regulatory control 
any material change in the framework in which we operate could have a material impact on the business 
for further discussion on the regulatory environment in which we operate  see item business insurance regulation 
operational risk 
our business is dependent on our ability to process  on a daily basis  our payment obligations under outstanding policies and the condition of the investment portfolio 
any failures in our internal processes  people or systems could lead to material  adverse consequences to the company 
in addition  despite the contingency plans in place  the ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a significant disruption in the infrastructure that supports our business and the community in which we are located 
interest rate risk 
our principal product is deferred annuities  which are interest rate sensitive instruments 
in an interest rate environment of falling or stable rates  annuity holders are less likely to seek to surrender their annuities prior to maturity due to the absence of alternative  higher yielding investments 
however  in an environment of moderately or significantly increasing rates  such surrenders should be expected to increase 
as of december   the existence of surrender fees on approximately of the insurance company s outstanding deferred annuities acts as a deterrent against surrenders 
however  if interest rates climb sufficiently  such fees may not have a significant deterrent effect 
moreover  the surrender fees are only in effect primarily for up to the first seven years of eac h annuity policy 
in the event of a substantial increase in surrenders during a short period of time  we may have to sell longer term assets to pay current surrender liabilities 
we continually develop strategies to address the match between the timing of our assets and liabilities 
to that end  in  and  a significant number of policies came off surrender charge and a significant portion of this business did surrender 
the company anticipated this event and maintained a significant level of cash equivalents to fund surrenders  avoiding the need to sell long term assets at a loss 
the company believes that the heavy surrender activity associated with the period is now largely behind us 
additionally  management has increased the incentive for agents to retain this business with the company by paying full first year compensation on internal rollovers 
since  a significantly smaller amount of business has been coming off surrender charge 
the tab le below shows the in force deferred annuities that are within the surrender charge period and the projected timing regarding the expiration of these surrender charges 
account value with surrender charges expiring year expiring account value in millions percent of account value expiring and later total pricing management believes that we are able to offer our products at competitive prices to the company s targeted markets as a result of i maintaining relatively low issuance costs by selling through the independent general agency system  ii minimizing home office administrative costs  and iii utilizing appropriate underwriting guidelines 
the long term profitability of sales of life and most annuity products depends on the degree of margin of the actuarial assumptions that underlie the pricing of such products 
actuarial calculations for such products  and the ultimate profitability of sales of such products  are based on four major factors i persistency  ii rate of return on cash invested during the life of the policy or contract  iii expenses of acquiring and administering the policy or contract  and iv mortality 
persistency is the rate at which insurance policies remain in force  expressed as a percentage of the number of policies remaining in force over the previous year 
policyholders can either surrender policies or cause their policies to lapse by failing to pay premiums 
ratio of annualized voluntary terminations surrenders and lapses to mean life insurance in force the assumed rate of return on invested cash and desired spreads during the period that insurance policies or annuity contracts are in force also affects pricing of products and currently includes an assumption of a specified rate of return and or spread on our investments for each year that such insurance or annuity product is in force 
investment results the following table summarizes our investment results for the periods indicated  as determined in accordance with gaap 
year ended december  as restated  see footnote in thousands cash and total invested assets net investment income effective yield net realized investment losses gains average of cash and aggregate invested amounts at the beginning and end of period 
net investment income is net of investment expenses and excludes capital gains and losses and provision for income taxes 
net investment income loss divided by average cash and total invested assets  based on book value including accrued investment income 
net realized investment gains losses include provisions for impairment in value that are considered other than temporary and exclude provisions for income taxes 
investments the company derives a predominant portion of its total revenues from investment income 
the company manages most of its investments internally 
all investments made on behalf of the company are governed by the statement of investment policy established and approved by the finance and investment committee and the board of directors of the insurance company and the company and by qualitative and quantitative limits prescribed by applicable insurance laws and regulations 
the finance and investment committee meets regularly to set and review investment policy and to approve current investment plans 
the actions of the finance and investment committees are subject to review and approval by the board of directors of the insurance company and the company 
the company statement of investment policy must comply with nysid regulations and the regulations of other applicable regulatory bodies 
the company investment philosophy generally focuses on purchasing investment grade securities with the intention of holding such securities to maturity 
however  as market opportunities  liquidity or regulatory considerations may dictate  securities may be sold prior to maturity 
the company has categorized all fixed maturity securities as available for sale and carries such investments at market value 
the company s goal in managing its investment portfolio is to meet the diversification  yield and liquidity requirements of its insurance policy and annuity contract obligations 
the company liquidity requirements are monitored regularly so that cash flow needs are satisfied 
adjustments periodically are made to the company investment policies to reflect changes in the company short and long term cash needs  as well as changing business and economic conditions 
the company seeks to manage its investment portfolio in part to reduce its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
in general  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuations in interest rates  and our net investment income increases or decreases in direct relationship with interest rate changes 
for example  if interest rates decline  the company fixed maturity investments generally will increase in market value  while net investment income will decrease as fixed income investments mature or are sold and proceeds are reinvested at the declining rates  and vice versa 
management is aware that prevailing market interest rates frequently shift and  accordingly  has adopted strategies that are designed to address either an increase or decrease in prevailing rates 
the companys principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
when assessing our intent to sell a fixed maturity security or if it is more likely that we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its cost basis  we evaluate facts and circumstances such as  but not limited to  decisions to reposition our security portfolio and sale of securities to meet cash flow needs 
in order to determine the amount of the credit loss for a fixed maturity security  we calculate the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the current cash flows and future cash flows we expect to recover 
the discount rate is the effecti ve interest rate implicit in the underlying fixed maturity security 
the effective interest rate is the original yield or the coupon if the fixed maturity security was previously impaired 
if an other than temporary impairment otti exists and we have the intent to sell the security  we conclude that the entire otti is credit related and the amortized cost for the security is written down to current fair value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our consolidated statements of income 
if we do not intend to sell a fixed maturity security or it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis but the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security referred to as the credit l oss  we conclude that an otti has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our consolidated statements of income  as this is also deemed the credit portion of the otti 
the remainder of the decline to fair value is recorded to other comprehensive income oci  as an unrealized otti loss on our consolidated balance sheets  as this is considered a noncredit ie  recoverable impairment 
to determine the recovery period of a fixed maturity security  we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer  including  but not limited to  the following historic and implied volatility of the security  length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area  failure  if any  of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments  and recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date 
for all fixed maturities securities evaluated for otti  we consider the timing and amount of the cash flows 
when evaluating whether our collateralized mortgage obligations cmos are other than temporarily impaired  we also examine the characteristics of the underlying collateral  such as delinquency  loss severities and default rates  the quality of the underlying borrower  the type of collateral in the pool  the vintage year of the collateral  subordination levels within the structure of the collateral pool  the quality of any credit guarantors  the susceptibility to variability of prepayments  our intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
in assessing corporate fixed maturities securities for ot ti  we evaluate the ability of the issuer to meet its debt obligations and the value of the company or specific collateral securing the debt position  including the fundamentals of the issuer to determine what we would recover if they were to file bankruptcy versus the price at which the market is trading  fundamentals of the industry in which the issuer operates  expectations regarding defaults and recovery rates and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency 
for an equity security  if we do not have the ability and intent to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for a recovery in value  we conclude that an otti has occurred  and the cost of the equity security is written down to the current fair value  with a corresponding change to realized gain loss in our consolidated statements of income 
we base our review on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the equity security as well as the cause of the decline  the length of time we have held the equity security  any third party research reports or analysis  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the security s issuer  taking into consideration the economic prospects of the issuer s industry and geogr aphical location 
as of december   of the company s invested assets approximately million consisted of short term commercial paper with maturities of less than days 
this compares to of the company s invested assets approximately million as of december  this commercial paper consisted of direct obligations of various corporations rated a minimum of a by standard and poor s and p by moody s 
this cash balance was reduced by million during  as the company determined that its cash balances were more than sufficient to cover projected cash needs from annuity surrenders and required payments 
as part of its asset liability management strategy  the insurance company had kept elevated levels of cash investments since  but management currently believes that its excess cash should be invested in additional fixed income investments to augment investment income 
as of december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company total invested assets were invested in limited partnerships and equity securities 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   the company was committed  if called upon during a specified period  to contribute an aggregate of approximately million of additional capital to certain of these limited partnerships 
commitments of million are expected to expire in  million in  and million in in general  risks associated with such limited partnerships include those related to their underlying investments ie  equity securities  debt securities and real estate  plus a level of illiquidity 
nbs p  with the exception of hedge funds  these risks are mitigated by our ability to receive quarterly distributions of partnership earnings 
despite earning positive returns on its limited partnership investments and their substantial contributions to the company s profits in the years prior to the very significant market and economic downturn from to  the company s limited partnership investments performed poorly in late and in  contributing significant pressure on net income in these periods 
performance rebounded somewhat in there can be no assurance that we will again achieve the same level of positive returns on our investments in limited partnerships that we achieved in years prior to the downturn or that we will achieve any returns on such investments at all 
 in addition  there can be no assurance that we will receive a return of all or any portion of our current or future capital investments in limited partnerships 
the failure to receive the return of a material portion of our capital investments in limited partnerships  or to achieve historic levels of returns on such investments  would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
approximately million or of the limited partnership portfolio is invested in restructuring funds 
approximately of the funds invested in this segment by the company are in four partnerships which are managed by two different general partners  each of which have significant experience in distressed debt investing 
these general partners seek to invest in situations that reflect a significant discount to underlying collateral value or enterprise value  or both  with the intent of recovering substantial premiums to acquisition prices 
a common element to each general partner s approach is to identify good companies with weak balance sheets through a rigorous fundamental analysis of each individual investment  combined with an emphasis on the acquisition of securities in the upper part of the capital structure 
securities or obligations of entities involved in or emerging from reorganization proceedings under u 
s 
bankruptcy laws are often available at prices that may represent significant discounts to underlying collateral values or enterprise values 
investment strategies in this segment include investments in secured debt of distressed companies where the general partner believes it can significantly influence the outcome of events by acquiring a controlling or blocking interest in order to maximize recoveries and returns 
control focused strategies can provide for the ability to mitigate risk by influencing not only the timing of a re organization but also the structure of a company s reorganized balance sheet 
the primary market risks in the company s investment portfolio are interest rate risk  credit risk and market valuation risk 
changes in credit risk are generally measured by changes in corporate yields in relation to the underlying treasuries corporate spreads as well as changes in the credit default swap cds market  although the company is a cash investor and does not buy or sell credit default swaps 
the company exposure to foreign exchange risk is insignificant 
the company has no direct commodity risk 
changes in interest rates can potentially impact our profitability 
in certain scenarios where interest rates are volatile  we could be exposed to disintermediation risk asset liability mismatch and reduction in net interest rate spread or profit margin

benefits and expenses interest credited and benefits to policyholders interest credited and benefits paid to policyholders amounted to million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal these represent an increase of comparing fiscal to fiscal and a increase in comparing fiscal to fiscal in  and  the insurance company s average credited rate for reserves and account balances was less than the company s ratio of net investment income to mean assets based on book value rate on investments for the same period as noted above under net investment income 
there can be no assurance that the company ratio of net investment income to book value mean assets the spread will not decline in future periods or that such decline will not have a material adverse effect on the company financial condition and results of operations 
depending  in part  upon competitive factors affecting the industry in general  and the company  in pa rticular  the company may  from time to time  change the average credited rates on certain of its products 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to reduce such rates or that any such reductions will broaden the spread 
the company has performed an updated loss recognition test to re confirm the recoverability of deferred acquisition costs  with best estimate actuarial assumptions 
the actual spread  excluding capital gains  for the months ended december   and was  
and  respectively 
for the year ending december  as restated see footnote as restated see footnote rate on investments credited rate spread interest expense on notes payable the interest expense on our notes payable amounted to approximately million in and approximately million in the decrease in was due to the repayment of our senior note in february of the company did not incur any interest expense in general expenses and taxes  commissions  costs related to consent revocation and proxy solicitation general expenses  taxes  commissions to agents and costs related to consent revocation and proxy solicitation totaled million in as compared to million in and million in this represents a decrease of comparing to and an increase of comparing to the decrease in was primarily due to lower commissions as low interest rates dramatically slowed the sales of deferred annuities 
the increase in was primarily due to increased corporate and legal expenses in connection with herbert kurz s commencement of a failed consent solicitation 
change in deferred policy acquisition costs dac the change in the net dac for the year ended december  resulted in a charge of approximately million  as compared to a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  and a charge of approximately million for the year ended december  changes in dac consist of three elements deferred costs associated with product sales  amortization of the dac on deferred annuity business and amortization of the dac on the remainder of the company s business  and is summarized below for the years ended december  as restated see footnote as restated see footnote deferred costs associated with product sales amortization of dac on deferred annuity business amortization of dac on the remainder of the company s business net change in dac under applicable accounting rules  dac related to deferred annuities is amortized in proportion to the estimated gross profits over the estimated lives of the contracts 
essentially  as estimated profits of the insurance company related to these assets increase  the amount and timing of amortization is accelerated 
the difference between the net change in dac in and in is primarily attributable to the lower level of deferred costs associated with product sales during c 
income loss before income taxes for the reasons discussed above  income loss before income taxes amounted to approximately million in  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in d 
income taxes income tax expenses of approximately million and million were generated in and  respectively  as compared to a benefit of approximately million in higher income in and generated higher income taxes 
the benefit in was primarily attributable to a lower net income and a deferred tax benefit realized on other than temporary impairments incurred on the company s investment portfolio 
e 
net income as a result of the factors and results discussed above  the company had net income of approximately million in  as compared to million in and a net loss of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income accumulated other comprehensive income increased from approximately million at december  to million at december  the increase was due to an increase in net unrealized investment gains  net of taxes  during the year of approximately million 
general economic and market conditions were the primary reasons for the increase 
the following information summarizes the components of the unrealized investment gains losses as of december  december  as restated see footnote in thousands fixed maturities limited partnerships common stocks tax effect contra dac effect liquidity and capital resources general the company is an insurance holding company and its primary uses of cash are operating expenses and dividend payments 
the company s principal sources of cash are sales of and interest on the company s investments  rent from its real estate and dividends from the insurance company 
in  the board of directors reduced the quarterly dividend by to 
per share as a prudent measure to preserve capital 
during  and  the company did not repurchase any of its common stock  although at december   the company was authorized to purchase approximately  shares of common stock 
the insurance company is subject to various regulatory restrictions on the maximum amount of payments  including loans  dividends or cash advances  that it may make to the company without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
under the new york insurance law  the insurance company is permitted  without prior insurance regulatory clearance  to pay a dividend to the company as long as the aggregate amount of all such dividends in any calendar year does not exceed the lesser of i of its statutory surplus as of the immediately preceding calendar year or ii its statutory net gain from operations for the immediately preceding calendar year after tax  excluding realized capital gains and losses 
the insurance company will only be permitted to pay a dividend to the company in excess of that amount if it files notice of its intention to declare such a dividend and the amount thereof with the superintendent and the superintende nt does not disapprove the distribution 
the insurance company paid million  million and million in dividends to the company in fiscal  and  respectively 
in  the insurance company would be permitted to pay a stockholder dividend of up to million to the company without prior regulatory clearance 
on a going forward basis  there can be no assurance that the insurance company will have sufficient statutory earnings to fund its cash requirements and pay cash dividends or that the superintendent will not disapprove any dividends that the insurance company must submit for the superintendent s consideration 
the company was able to meet all its liquidity needs in  including the payment of dividends  and anticipates being able to meet those needs in and for the reasonably foreseeable future 
principal sources of funds at the insurance company are premiums and other considerations paid  net investment income received and proceeds from investments called  redeemed or sold 
the principal uses of these funds are the payment of benefits on annuity contracts and life insurance policies including withdrawals and surrender payments  the payment of policy acquisition costs  operating expenses and the purchase of investments 
given the insurance company s historical cash flow and current financial results  management believes that  for the reasonably foreseeable future  the insurance company s cash flow from operating activities will provide sufficient liquidity for the operations of the insurance company 
the insurance company s inability to upstream a dividend could have an adverse material impact on the company 
with no debt on the balance sheet  currently the company s biggest cash outlay is to its shareholders in the form of cash dividends  which at the current level of 
per share annually  total approximately million per year 
the insurance company s current capital and surplus level does not trigger an urgent need for capital raising at the company 
however  the company  from time to time  explores capital raising options for various reasons  including  but not limited to  the following positive impact on credit rating agencies analysis  increasing new business capacity and market share  opportunities for future possible mergers and or acquisitions  increasing financial flexibility  possible additional restrictions by the nysid on dividends that could be up streamed from the insurance company 
should the company decide to raise capital subject to current financial and economic environments  it will be challenging and expensive 
several options are available including  but not limited to  the following bank lines of credit loans  sale of home office property  public or private offerings of common stock  preferred stock or other securities 
if the insurance company does not have the financial flexibility to upstream a dividend to the company and the company is restricted in its ability to raise capital  the board of directors may decide to reduce or suspend the payment of dividends to shareholders until capital conditions improve 
under gaap  net cash provided by used in the company s operating activities was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash provided by the company investing activities principally reflecting investments purchased  called  redeemed or sold was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for purposes of the company consolidated statements of cash flows  financing activities relate primarily to sales and surrenders of the insurance company annuity and universal life insurance products 
the payment of dividends by the company to its stockholders is also considered to be a financing activity 
net cash used in the company financing activities amounted to approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these fluctuations primarily are attributable to changes in policyholder account balances as a result of surrenders  sales and interest earned by the policyholders 
the repayment of the corporate debt was also a primarily use of cash in and market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of our primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed 
we believe that a portfolio composed principally of fixed rate investments that generate predictable rates of return should back our fixed rate liabilities 
we do not have a specific target rate of return 
instead  our rates of return vary over time depending on the current interest rate environment  the slope of the yield curve  the spread at which fixed rate investments are priced over the yield curve  and general economic conditions 
our portfolio strategy is designed to achieve adequate risk adjusted returns consistent with our investment objectives of effective asset liability matching  liquidity and safety 
in order to maintain consistency in our portfolio  our deferred annuity products incorporate surrender charges to discourage surrenders or withdrawals 
annuitants may not terminate or withdraw funds from their annuity contracts for a significant initial period generally seven years without incurring penalties in the form of surrender charges 
these surrender charges generally range from to of the investment 
approximately  and of the insurance company deferred annuity contracts in force measured by reserves as of december    and were surrenderable without charge 
the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio changes as interest rates change 
in general  rate decreases cause asset prices to rise  while rate increases cause asset prices to fall 
based on market values and prevailing interest rates as of december   a hypothetical instantaneous increase in interest rates of basis points would produce a loss in fair value of our fixed maturity assets of approximately million 
conversely  a hypothetical instantaneous decrease in interest rates of basis points would produce a gain in fair value of our fixed maturity assets of approximately million 
asset liability management a persistent focus of our management is maintaining the appropriate balance between the duration of invested assets and the duration of contractual liabilities to the company s annuity holders and credit suppliers 
towards this end  at least quarterly  the investment department of the company determines the duration of the company s invested assets in coordination with the company s actuaries  who are responsible for calculating the liability duration 
in the event it is determined that the duration gap between its assets and liabilities exceeds a one year target level  the company may re position its assets through the sale of invested assets or the purchase of new investments 
the company manages the investment portfolio focusing on duration management to support our current and future liabilities 
through periodic monitoring of the effective duration of the company s assets and liabilities  the company ensures that the degree of duration mismatch is within the guidelines of the company s policy which provides for a mismatch of up to one year 
as of december  and december   the effective duration of the company fixed income portfolio was approximately and years  respectively 
the effective duration of the company s liabilities for the same periods was approximately and years 
another element of the asset liability management strategy is to hedge against the risks posed by a rapid and sustained rise in interest rates by entering into a form of derivative transaction known as a payor swaption 
the effect of this transaction would be to lessen the negative impact on the company of a significant increase in interest rates 
with payor swaptions  the company should be able to maintain more competitive crediting rates to policyholders when interest rates rise 
during the period  the company established and implemented a program of payor swaptions designed to lessen the impact of a basis points rise in interest rates 
the company established international swaps and derivatives association isda credit support agreements with its various counterparties  which are six money center banks with credit ratings exceeding aa by moody s and a by standard and poor s 
the final contract expired on june  with no residual value 
from year end to expiration  the change in market value was a loss of  in december  the company executed a new series of payor swaptions expiring in january  and for a total consideration of  the counterparties were major us money center banks rated aaa aaa and aa aa by moody s and standard poor s  respectively 
total notional value of the swaptions is  and is designed to cover approximately of the potential portfolio loss in the event of a basis point rise in interest rates from current levels 
future consideration of these transactions or other asset liability management strategies is dependent upon periodic testing based on updated asset and liability data 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has not entered into any off balance sheet financing arrangements and has made no financial commitments or guarantees with any unconsolidated subsidiary or special purpose entity 
all of the company s subsidiaries are wholly owned and their results are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations the following presents a summary of the company s significant contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations less than year years years after years total unfunded limited partnership commitments uncertain tax liabilities policy liabilities total contractual obligations see note d summary of significant accounting policies  investments  of the consolidated financial statements the difference between the recorded liability of  million  and the total payment obligation amount of  million  is  million and is comprised of i future interest to be credited  ii the effect of mortality discount for those payments that are life contingent  and iii the impact of surrender charges on those contracts that have such charges 
of the total payment of  million   million  or is from the company s deferred annuity  life  and accident and health business 
determining the timing of these payments involves significant uncertainties  including mortality  morbidity  persistency  investment returns  and the timing of policyholder surrender 
notwithstanding these uncertainties  the table reflects an estimate of the timing of such payments 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes in a rising interest rate environment  the company average cost of funds would be expected to increase over time  as it prices its new and renewing annuities to maintain a generally competitive market rate 
in addition  the market value of the company fixed maturity portfolio would be expected to decrease  resulting in a decline in shareholders equity 
concurrently  the company would attempt to place new funds in investments that were matched in duration to  and higher yielding than  the liabilities associated with such annuities 
moreover  surrenders of its outstanding annuities would likely accelerate 
management believes that liquidity necessary in such an interest rate environment to fund withdrawals  including surrenders  would be available through income  cash flow  the company cash reserves and  if necessary  proceeds from the monetization of the payor swaption investments described above and the sale of short term and long term investments 
in a declining interest rate environment  the company cost of funds would be expected to decrease over time  reflecting lower interest crediting rates on its fixed annuities 
conversely  in an increasing interest rate environment  the cost of funds would be expected to increase  reflecting higher interest crediting rates 
should increased liquidity be required for withdrawals in such an interest rate environment  management believes that the portion of the company investments that are designated as available for sale in the company consolidated balance sheet could be sold without materially adverse consequences in light of the general strengthening in market prices that would be expected in the fixed maturity security market 
interest rate changes also may have temporary effects on the sale and profitability of our annuity products 
for example  if interest rates rise  competing investments such as annuity or life insurance products offered by the company competitors  certificates of deposit  mutual funds and similar instruments may become more attractive to potential purchasers of the company products until the company increases the rates credited to holders of its annuity products 
in contrast  as interest rates fall  we would attempt to lower our credited rates to compensate for the corresponding decline in net investment income 
as a result  changes in interest rates could materially adversely affect the financial condition and results of operations of the company depending on the attractiveness of alternative investments available to the company customers 
in that regard  in the current interest rate environment  the company has attempte d to maintain its credited rates at competitive levels designed to discourage surrenders and also to be considered attractive to purchasers of new annuity products 
recent accounting pronouncements see note  item n  notes to the consolidated financial statements for a full description of the new accounting pronouncements including the respective dates of adoption and the effects on the results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
the critical accounting policies  estimates and related judgments underlying the companys consolidated financial statements are summarized below 
in applying these accounting policies  management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
many of these policies  estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries  others are specific to the company s business operations 
fair value the company defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
in many cases  the exit price and the transaction or entry price will be the same at initial recognition 
however  in certain cases  the transaction price may not represent fair value 
it requires that fair value be a market based measurement in which the fair value is determined based on a hypothetical transaction at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of a market participant 
when quoted prices are not used to determine fair value  the company considers three broad valuation techniques i the market approach  ii the income approach  and iii the cost approach 
the company determines the most appropriate valuation technique to use  given what is being measured and the availability of sufficient inputs 
the company prioritizes the inputs to fair valuation techniques and allows for the use of unobservable inputs to the extent that observable inputs are not available 
the company categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at estimated fair value into a three level hierarchy  based on the priority of the inputs to the respective valuation technique 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
an asset or liability s classification within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input to its valuation 
the input levels are as follows level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
the company defines active markets based on average trading volume for equity securities 
the size of the bid ask spread is used as an indicator of market activity for fixed maturity securities 
level quoted prices in markets that are not active or inputs that are observable either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities other than quoted prices in level  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other significant inputs that are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and are significant to the estimated fair value of the assets or liabilities 
unobservable inputs reflect the reporting entity s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
level assets and liabilities include financial instruments whose values are determined using pricing models  discounted cash flow methodologies  or similar techniques  as well as instruments for which the determination of estimated fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation 
estimated fair value of investments the company s investments in fixed maturity and equity securities  investments in trading securities and certain short term investments are reported at their estimated fair value 
in determining the estimated fair value of these investments  various methodologies  assumptions and inputs are utilized  as described further below 
when available  the estimated fair value of securities is based on quoted prices in active markets that are readily and regularly obtainable 
generally  these are the most liquid of the company s securities holdings and valuation of these securities does not involve management judgment 
when quoted prices in active markets are not available  the determination of estimated fair value is based on market standard valuation methodologies 
the market standard valuation methodologies utilized include discounted cash flow methodologies  matrix pricing or other similar techniques 
the inputs to these market standard valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to interest rates  credit standing of the issuer or counterparty  industry sector of the issuer  coupon rate  call provisions  sinking fund requirements  maturity  estimated duration and management s assumptions regarding liquidity and estimated future cash flows 
accordingly  the estimated fair values are based on available market information and management s judgments about financial instruments 
the significant inputs to the market standard valuation methodologies for certain types of securities with reasonable levels of price transparency are inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
such observable inputs include benchmarking prices for similar assets in active  liquid markets  quoted prices in markets that are not active and observable yields and spreads in the market 
when observable inputs are not available  the market standard valuation methodologies for determining the estimated fair value of certain types of securities that trade infrequently  and therefore have little or no price transparency  rely on inputs that are significant to the estimated fair value that are not observable in the market or cannot be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data 
these unobservable inputs can be based in large part on management judgment or estimation  and cannot be supported by reference to market activity 
even though unobservable  these inputs are based on assumptions deemed appropriate given the circumstances and consistent with what other market participants would use when pricing such securities 
the company initially estimates the fair value of investments in certain limited partnerships by reference to the transaction price 
subsequently  the company generally obtains the fair value of these investments from net asset value information provided by the general partner or manager of the investments  the financial statements of which are generally audited annually 
the company considers observable market data and performs diligence procedures in validating the appropriateness of using the net asset value as a fair value measurement 
the remaining carrying value recognized in the consolidated balance sheets represents investments in other limited partnership interests accounted for using the equity method  which do not meet the definition of financial instruments for which fair value is required to be disclosed 
financial markets are susceptible to severe events evidenced by rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity 
the company s ability to sell securities  or the price ultimately realized for these securities  depends upon the demand and liquidity in the market and increases the use of judgment in determining the estimated fair value of certain securities 
investment impairments the companys principal investments are in fixed maturities  all of which are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of other than temporary impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
recognition of income ceases when a bond goes into default and management evaluates whether temporary or other than temporary impairments have occurred on a casebycase basis 
when assessing our intent to sell a fixed maturity security or if it is more likely that we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its cost basis  we evaluate facts and circumstances such as  but not limited to  decisions to reposition our security portfolio and sale of securities to meet cash flow needs 
in order to determine the amount of the credit loss for a fixed maturity secur ity  we calculate the recovery value by performing a discounted cash flow analysis based on the current cash flows and future cash flows we expect to recover 
the discount rate is the effective interest rate implicit in the underlying fixed maturity security 
the effective interest rate is the original yield or the coupon if the fixed maturity security was previously impaired 
if an otti exists and we have the intent to sell the security  we conclude that the entire otti is credit related and the amortized cost for the security is written down to current fair value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our consolidated statements of income 
if we do not intend to sell a fixed maturity security or it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis but the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost of the fixed maturity security refer red to as the credit loss  we conclude that an otti has occurred and the amortized cost is written down to the estimated recovery value with a corresponding charge to realized loss on our consolidated statements of income  as this is also deemed the credit portion of the otti 
the remainder of the decline to fair value is recorded to oci  as an unrealized otti loss on our consolidated balance sheets  as this is considered a noncredit ie  recoverable impairment 
to determine the recovery period of a fixed maturity security  we consider the facts and circumstances surrounding the underlying issuer including  but not limited to  the following historic and implied volatility of the security  length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  adverse conditions specifically related to the security or to specific conditions in an industry or geographic area  failure  if any  of the issuer of the security to make scheduled payments  and recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date 
for all fixed maturities securities evaluated for otti  we consider the timing and amount of the cash flows 
when evaluating whether our collateralized mortgage obligations cmos are other than temporarily impaired  we also examine the characteristics of the underlying collateral  such as delinquency  loss severities and default rates  the quality of the underlying borrower  the type of collateral in the pool  the vintage year of the collateral  subordination levels within the structure of the collateral pool  the quality of any credit guarantors  the susceptibility to variability of prepayments  our intent to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of its amortized cost basis 
in assessing corporate fixed maturities securities for ot ti  we evaluate the ability of the issuer to meet its debt obligations and the value of the company or specific collateral securing the debt position including the fundamentals of the issuer to determine what we would recover if they were to file bankruptcy versus the price at which the market is trading  fundamentals of the industry in which the issuer operates  expectations regarding defaults and recovery rates  and changes to the rating of the security by a rating agency 
for all equity investments including limited partnerships  if we do not have the ability and intent to hold the security for a sufficient period of time to allow for a recovery in value  we conclude that an otti has occurred  and the cost of the equity security is written down to the current fair value  with a corresponding change to realized gain loss in our consolidated statements of income 
we base our review on a number of factors including  but not limited to  the severity and duration of the decline in fair value of the equity security as well as the cause of the decline  the length of time we have held the equity security  any third party research reports or analysis  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the security s issuer  taking into consideration the economic prospects of the issuer s industry and geographical location 
for equity method investees  the company considers financial and other information provided by the limited partnerships  other known information and inherent risks in the underlying investments  as well as future capital commitments  in determining whether an impairment has occurred 
when an otti is deemed to have occurred  the company records a realized capital loss to record the investment at its estimated fair value 
investments in limited partnerships where consolidation is not appropriate  the company applies the equity method of accounting consistent with asc  investments equity method and joint ventures  to limited partnerships in which the company holds either a a five percent or greater interest or b less than a five percent interest  but with respect to which partnership the company has more than virtually no influence over the operating or financial policies of the limited partnership 
the company records realized and unrealized earnings or losses of the limited partnerships in net income each period 
generally  the company records its share of its earnings using a three month lag 
the company applies the fair value method of accounting consistent with asc  financial services insurance  to those limited partnerships in which the company holds less than a five percent interest and does not have more than virtually no influence over the operating or financial policies of the limited partnership 
the company recognizes the unrealized change in fair value of a partnership interest as a component of equity other comprehensive income or loss each period and recognizes cash distributions in earnings each period 
the company considers certain qualitative factors in assessing whether it has more than virtually no influence for partnership interests of less than five percent 
recognition of insurance income and related expenses premiums from traditional life and annuity contracts with life contingencies are recognized as income over the premium paying period 
benefits and expenses are matched with such income so as to result in the recognition of profits over the life of the contracts 
this matching is accomplished by means of provision for liabilities for future policy benefits and the deferral and subsequent amortization of policy acquisition costs 
for contracts with a single premium or a limited number of premium payments due over a significantly shorter period than the total period over which benefits are provided limited payment contracts  premiums are recorded as income when due with any excess profit deferred and recognized in income in a constant relationship to insurance in force or  for annuities  the amount of expected future benefit payments 
premiums from universal life and investment type contracts are reported as deposits to policyholders account balances 
revenues from these contracts consist of amounts assessed during the period against policyholders account balances for mortality charges and surrender charges 
policy benefits and claims that are charged to expense include benefit claims incurred in the period in excess of related policyholders account balances and interest credited to policyholders account balances 
for the years ended december    and  approximately  and  respectively  of premiums from traditional life  annuity  universal life and investment type contracts received by the company were attributable to sales to annuitants and policyholders residing in the state of new york 
premiums  benefits and expenses are stated net of reinsurance ceded to other companies 
estimated reinsurance recoverables and the cost of reinsurance are recognized over the life of the reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies 
deferred policy acquisition costs the insurance company incurs significant costs in connection with acquiring new business 
under applicable accounting rules  these costs  which vary  are deferred 
the recovery of such costs is dependent upon the future profitability of the related product  which in turn is dependent mainly on investment returns in excess of interest credited  as well as persistency and expenses 
these factors enter into managements estimate of future gross profits  which generally are used to amortize such costs 
changes in these estimates result in changes to the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made and could result in the impairment of the deferred acquisition cost asset and a charge to income if estimated future gross profits are less than amounts deferred 
to demonstrate the sensitivity of our net dac balance million as of december  relative to our future spreads and expenses  the information below indicates how much the net dac balance would have changed if the future spread assumption decreased by and if the future expense assumption increased by 
we believe that any variation in our expense or spread estimate is likely to fall within these ranges 
change in assumption decrease in net dac asset future spread decreases million future expenses increase million each year the company conducts testing to confirm that the dac asset is recoverable and that no premium deficiency reserves are deemed necessary 
future policy benefits the insurance company establishes liabilities for amounts payable under life and health insurance policies and annuity contracts 
generally  these amounts are payable over a long period of time and the profitability of the products is dependent on the pricing 
principal assumptions used in pricing policies and in the establishment of liabilities for future policy benefits are investment returns  mortality  expenses and persistency 
the reserves reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements included herein are calculated based on gaap and differ from those specified by the laws of the various states in which the insurance company does business and those reflected in the insurance company statutory financial statements 
these differences arise from the use of different mortality and morbidity tables and interest rate assumptions  the introduction of lapse assumptions into the reserve calculation and the use of the net level premium reserve method on all insurance business 
see notes h and i to the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the reserves reflected in the company consolidated financial statements are based upon the company best estimates of mortality  persistency  expenses and investment income  with appropriate provisions for adverse statistical deviation and the use of the net level premium method for all noninterest sensitive products 
for all interest sensitive products  the policy account value is equal to the accumulation of gross premiums plus interest credited less mortality and expense charges and withdrawals 
in determining reserves for its insurance and annuity products  the insurance company performs periodic studies to compare current experience for mortality  interest and lapse rates with expected experience in the reserve assumptions 
differences are reflected currently in earnings for each period 
for policies and contracts where the reserve is reported as the account balance  million  a change in expected experience would have no effect on the reserve 
for those annuities and supplementary contracts with life contingencies that comprise a portion of future policy benefits million of reserves  an increase in mortality experience of per year for individual contracts would increase the present value of future benefits by approximately million 
conversely  a decrease in mortality experience of per year would decrease the present value of future benefits by approximately million 
we believe that any variation of our mortality estimates is likely to fall within this range 
for traditional life insurance business million of reserves  establishing reserves requires the use of many assumptions 
due to the number of independent variables inherent in the calculation of these reserves  and because this business is not material to the overall company results  it is not practical to perform a quantitative analysis on the impact of changes in underlying assumptions 
however  the insurance company historically has not experienced significant adverse deviations from its assumptions and believes that its assumptions are realistic and produce reserves that are fairly stated in accordance with gaap 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under fasb codification topic asc 
accordingly  we use the asset and liability method to record deferred income taxes 
accordingly  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized that reflect the net tax effect of the temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes  using enacted tax rates 
such temporary differences are primarily due to tax basis of reserves for future policy benefits  deferred acquisition costs  and net operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is applied to deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all  or some portion  of the benefits related to the deferred tax assets will not be r ealized 
uncertain tax liabilities we have open tax years in the united states that are currently under examination by the applicable taxing authorities  and certain later tax years that may in the future be subject to examination 
we periodically evaluate the adequacy of our uncertain tax liabilities and tax reserves  taking into account our open tax return positions  tax assessments received and tax law changes 
the process of evaluating uncertain tax liabilities and tax reserves involves the use of estimates and a high degree of management judgment 
the final determination of tax audits could affect our tax reserves
