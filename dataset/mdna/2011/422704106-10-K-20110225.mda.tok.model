item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for a summary of average market and realized prices for each of the three years ended december   and hecla s average realized prices for all four metals increased in compared to  and our realized prices for silver and gold in were higher than average market prices for those metals in  due in part to the timing of concentrate shipments and their final settlement in comparison to fluctuating prices 
however  we believe that market metal price trends are a significant factor in our operating and financial performance 
because we are unable to predict fluctuations in prices for metals and have limited control over the timing of our concentrate shipments  there can be no assurance that our realized prices for silver and gold will exceed or even meet average market metals prices for any future period 
in april  we began utilizing forward contracts for lead and zinc with the objective of managing the exposure to changes in prices of lead and zinc contained in our concentrate shipments between the time of sale and final settlement 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our base metal forward contract programs 
our results of operations are significantly impacted by fluctuations in the prices of silver  gold  lead and zinc  which are affected by numerous factors beyond our control

risk factors financial risks a substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us for information on the various factors that can impact prices of the metals we produce 
exploration and pre production development expenditures totaling million  million  million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december     and these amounts include expenditures for the now divested hollister development block  as its development progressed until the sale of our interest in the project in april  of million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and in addition to the amounts above  we also incurred exploration expenditures of million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and at our now divested venezuelan operations 
these amounts have been reported in income loss from discontinued operations for each period 
provision for closed operations and environmental matters of million  million  million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december      and the provision includes a million adjustment to increase our accrued liability for environmental obligations in idaho s coeur d alene basin as a result of the negotiators representing hecla  the united states  the coeur d alene indian tribe  and the state of idaho reaching an understanding on proposed financial terms to be incorporated into a comprehensive settlement of the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims  including any remaining obligations of hecla limited under the box consent decree 
such comprehensive settlement would contain additional terms yet to be negotiated  and certain other conditions must be satisfied before a settlement is finalized 
the increase in our accrual from prior periods results from several factors impacting the basin liability  all of which would be addressed in the potential settlement 
these factors include i as a result of work completed  and information learned by us  in the fourth quarter of  we expect the cost of future remediation and past response costs in the upper basin to increase from previous estimates  ii any potential settlement of the basin litigation would address the entire basin  including the lower basin  for which we do not know the extent of any future remediation plans  other than the epa has announced that it plans to issue a rod amendment for the lower basin in the future  which would include a lower basin remediation plan for which hecla limited may have had some liability  and iii inclusion of natural resource damages in any potential settlement  for which we are unable to estimate any range of liability  however  as stated in their own filings  the united states and the tribe s claims for natural resource damages may range in the billions of dollars 
the amount includes an increase of million to our then estimated liabilities for the coeur d alene basin and the bunker hill superfund site

item a 
risk factors the following risks and uncertainties  together with the other information set forth in this form k  should be carefully considered by those who invest in our securities 
any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results and could decrease the value of our common and or preferred stock 
financial risks a global financial crisis may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 
the recent credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system had an impact on our business and financial position  and a similar financial crisis in the future may also impact us 
the continuation or re emergence of the financial crisis may limit our ability to raise capital through credit and equity markets 
as discussed further below  the prices of the metals that we produce are affected by a number of factors  and it is unknown how these factors may be impacted by a global financial crisis 
we have had losses that could reoccur in the future 
although we reported net income for the years ended december   and of million  million and million  respectively  we reported a net loss for the year ended december  of million 
a comparison of operating results over the past three years can be found in results of operations in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
many of the factors affecting our operating results are beyond our control  including the volatility of metals prices  smelter terms  diesel fuel prices  interest rates  global or regional political or economic policies  inflation  availability and cost of labor  economic developments and crises  governmental regulations  continuity of orebodies  ore grades  recoveries  and speculation  aggregation and sales by central banks and other holders and producers of gold and silver in response to these factors 
we cannot foresee whether our operations will continue to generate sufficient revenue in order for us to generate net cash from operating activities 
there can be no assurance that we will not experience net losses in the future 
commodity risk management activities could expose us to losses 
we periodically enter into risk management activities  such as forward sales contracts and commodity put and call option contracts  to manage the prices received on the metals we produce 
such activities are utilized to attempt to insulate our operating results from changes in prices for those metals 
however  such activities may prevent us from realizing possible revenues in the event that the market price of a metal exceeds the price stated in a forward sale or call option contract 
in addition  we may experience losses if a counterparty fails to purchase under a contract when the contract price exceeds the spot price of a commodity 
during the second quarter of  we initiated financially settled forward contract programs to manage the exposure to changes in lead and zinc prices contained in our concentrate shipments between the time of sale and final settlement  and to manage the exposure of changes in the prices of lead and zinc contained in our forecasted future concentrate shipments 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on these base metals forward contract programs 
if we are able to settle the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and other claims  the financial terms of settlement will materially impact our cash resources and our access to additional financing 
the negotiators representing hecla and the united states and the coeur d alene indian tribe plaintiffs  and the state of idaho  have reached an understanding on proposed financial terms to be incorporated into a comprehensive settlement of the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims  including any remaining obligations of hecla limited under the box consent decree 
such a comprehensive settlement would contain additional terms yet to be negotiated  and certain other conditions must be satisfied before a settlement is finalized 
if such settlement is finalized and a consent decree entered  substantial cash payment obligations by us would be required  including million within days after entry of the consent decree 
million in cash or shares of hecla mining company common stock  at our election  within days after entry of the consent decree 
million within days after the first anniversary of entry of the consent decree 
million within days after the second anniversary of entry of the consent decree 
million by august  in the form of quarterly payments of the proceeds from exercises of any outstanding series and series warrants which have an exercise price of between and per share during the quarter with the balance of the million due in august regardless of the amount of warrants that have been exercised 
we have received proceeds of approximately million for the exercise of series and series warrants as of the date of this report  which we anticipate would be paid to the plaintiffs within days after entry of the consent decree 
more information about the proposed financial terms of settlement is set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the requirement to pay million plus proceeds from exercised warrants which totaled approximately million as of december  in cash in would cause us to use a significant portion of our cash on hand  which  as of december   was million including cash equivalents 
our cash on hand could be further reduced in the near term if we elect to pay the million in cash  instead of shares of our common stock 
also  if additional warrants are not exercised  the requirement to pay up to million excluding interest in cash over the next approximately three years will cause us to use a significant portion of either our cash currently on hand  or future cash resources 
there can be no assurance that we will have the cash on hand to meet these obligations 
financial terms of settlement would also require that hecla mining company or hecla limited post third party surety in some form to secure the million  million  and million payments 
obtaining surety will cause us to incur costs  and will also cause us to utilize credit capacity which could otherwise be used to fund other areas of our business  including operations and capital expenditures 
moreover  there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain such surety  in which case we could be in default of the consent decree  which could have a material adverse effect on hecla limited s or our results from operations or financial position 
the financial terms summarized above would be part of any final and complete settlement reflected in a consent decree 
however  no assurance can be given that final settlement will be reached and a consent decree entered 
see item a 
risk factors legal  market and regulatory risks the financial terms of proposed settlement that we negotiated with the plaintiffs and the state of idaho s negotiators regarding the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims are non binding and are not final  and complete settlement of the litigation and other claims may not be reached and we are required to obtain governmental and lessor approvals and permits in order to conduct mining operations 
our profitability could be affected by the prices of other commodities and services 
our business activities are highly dependent on the costs of commodities and services such as fuel  steel  cement and electricity 
the recent prices for such commodities have been volatile and may increase our costs of production and development 
a material increase in costs at any of our operating properties could have a significant effect on our profitability 
for additional discussion  see results of operations in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our accounting and other estimates may be imprecise 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosure of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reporting periods 
the more significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to mineral reserves and other mineralized material that are the basis for future income and cash flow estimates and units of production depreciation  depletion and amortization calculations  future metals prices  environmental  reclamation and closure obligations  asset impairments  reserves for contingencies and litigation  and deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates using different assumptions or conditions 
for additional information  see critical accounting estimates in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  note significant accounting policies of notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors our development of new orebodies and other capital costs may cost more and provide less return than we estimated  our ore reserve estimates may be imprecise and our environmental obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
a substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us 
our revenue is derived from the sale of silver  gold  lead and zinc and  as a result  our earnings are directly related to the prices of these metals 
silver  gold  lead and zinc prices fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors  including speculative activities  relative exchange rates of the us dollar  global and regional demand and production  political instability  inflation  recession or increased or reduced economic activity  and other political  regulatory and economic conditions 
these factors are largely beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
if the market prices for these metals fall below our production or development costs for a sustained period of time  we will experience losses and may have to discontinue exploration  development or operations  or incur asset write downs at one or more of our properties 
the following table sets forth the average daily closing prices of the following metals for the year ended december  and each year thereafter through silver per oz 
gold per oz 
lead per lb 
zinc per lb 
london fix london final london metals exchange cash london metals exchange special high grade cash on february   the closing prices for silver  gold  lead and zinc were per ounce   per ounce  per pound and per pound  respectively 
an extended decline in metals prices  an increase in operating or capital costs  or our inability to convert exploration potential to reserves may cause us to record write downs  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
we review the recoverability of the cost of our long lived assets by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
impairment  measured by comparing an asset s carrying value to its fair value  must be recognized when the carrying value of the asset exceeds these cash flows  and recognizing impairment write downs could negatively impact our results of operations 
metal price estimates are a key component used in the analysis of the carrying values of our assets 
we evaluated the december  carrying values of long lived assets at our greens creek and lucky friday segments by comparing them to the average estimated undiscounted cash flows resulting from operating plans using various metals price scenarios 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows for each of our properties also include an estimate of the market value of the exploration potential beyond the current operating plans 
because the average estimated undiscounted cash flows exceeded the asset carrying values  we did not record impairments as of december  however  if the prices of silver  gold  zinc and lead decline for an extended period of time or we fail to control production costs or realize the mineable ore reserves or exploration potential at our mining properties  we may be required to recognize asset write downs in the future 
in addition  the perceived market value of the exploration potential of our properties is dependent upon prevailing metals prices as well as our ability to discover economic ore 
a decline in metals prices for an extended period of time or our inability to convert exploration potential to reserves could significantly reduce our estimations of the value of the exploration potential at our properties and result in asset write downs 
our ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income we recognize the expected future tax benefit from deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets 
assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income 
estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted income from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction 
metal price estimates are a key component used in the determination of our ability to realize the expected future benefit of our deferred tax assets 
to the extent that future taxable income differs significantly from estimates as a result of a decline in metals prices or other factors  our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted 
additionally  significant future issuances of common stock or common stock equivalents could limit our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
future changes in tax law or changes in ownership structure could limit our ability to utilize our recorded tax assets 
as of december   we lifted substantially all deferred tax valuation allowances and our current and non current deferred tax asset balances were million and million  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our deferred tax assets 
returns for investments in pension plans and pension plan funding requirements are uncertain we maintain defined benefit pension plans for employees  which provide for specified payments after retirement for most employees 
the ability of the pension plans to provide the specified benefits depends on our funding of the plans and returns on investments made by the plans 
returns  if any  on investments are subject to fluctuations based on investment choices and market conditions 
a sustained period of low returns or losses on investments could require us to fund the pension plans to a greater extent than anticipated 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our pension plans 
operation  development  exploration and acquisition risks we may be subject to a number of unanticipated risks related to inadequate infrastructure 
mining  processing  development and exploration activities depend on adequate infrastructure 
reliable roads  bridges  power sources and water supply are important determinants  which affect capital and operating costs 
unusual or infrequent weather phenomena  sabotage  government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure could adversely affect our mining operations 
our development of new orebodies and other capital costs may be higher and provide less return than we estimated 
capitalized development projects may cost more and provide less return than we estimate 
if we are unable to realize a return on these investments  we may incur a related asset write down that could adversely affect our financial results or condition 
our ability to sustain or increase our current level of metals production partly depends on our ability to develop new orebodies and or expand existing mining operations 
before we can begin a development project  we must first determine whether it is economically feasible to do so 
this determination is based on estimates of several factors  including ore reserves  expected recovery rates of metals from the ore  future metals prices  facility and equipment costs  availability of adequate manpower  availability of affordable sources of power and adequacy of water supply  exploration and drilling success  capital and operating costs of a development project  environmental considerations and permitting  adequate access to the site  including competing land uses such as agriculture  applicable tax rates  foreign currency fluctuation and inflation rates  and availability of financing 
these estimates are based on geological and other interpretive data  which may be imprecise 
as a result  actual operating and capital costs and returns from a development project may differ substantially from our estimates  and  as such  it may not be economically feasible to continue with a development project 
our ore reserve estimates may be imprecise 
our ore reserve figures and costs are primarily estimates and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of these metals 
you are strongly cautioned not to place undue reliance on estimates of reserves 
reserves are estimates made by our professional technical personnel  and no assurance can be given that the estimated amount of metal or the indicated level of recovery of these metals will be realized 
reserve estimation is an interpretive process based upon available data and various assumptions 
our reserve estimates may change based on actual production experience 
further  reserves are valued based on estimates of costs and metals prices  which may not be consistent among our properties 
the economic value of ore reserves may be adversely affected by declines in the market price of the various metals we mine  increased production or capital costs  reduction in the grade or tonnage of the deposit  increase in the dilution of the ore  and reduced recovery rates 
short term operating factors relating to our ore reserves  such as the need to sequentially develop orebodies and the processing of new or different ore grades  may adversely affect our cash flow 
if the prices of metals that we produce decline substantially below the levels used to calculate reserves for an extended period  we could experience delays in new project development  net losses  reduced cash flow  reductions in reserves  write downs of asset values  and mine closure 
efforts to expand the finite lives of our mines may not be successful or could result in significant demands on our liquidity  which could hinder our growth and decrease the value of our stock 
one of the risks we face is that our mines are a depleting asset 
thus  we must continually replace depleted ore reserves 
our ability to expand or replace ore reserves primarily depends on the success of our exploration programs 
mineral exploration  particularly for silver and gold  is highly speculative and expensive 
it involves many risks and is often non productive 
even if we believe we have found a valuable mineral deposit  it may be several years before production from that deposit is possible 
during that time  it may become no longer feasible to produce those minerals for economic  regulatory  political or other reasons 
as a result of high costs and other uncertainties  we may not be able to expand or replace our existing ore reserves as they are depleted  which would adversely affect our business and financial position in the future 
over the past years we have evaluated alternatives for deeper access at the lucky friday mine in order to expand its operational life 
as a result  we initiated work on an internal shaft at lucky friday shaft  including detailed shaft design  excavation of the hoist room and off shaft development access to shaft facilities  placement and receipt of orders for major equipment purchases  and other construction activities 
upon completion  shaft would allow us to mine mineralized material below our current workings and provide deeper platforms for exploration 
construction of shaft would take approximately four more years to complete  and capital expenditures for the project would total approximately million  including approximately million spent on the project through december  our management currently expects to seek final approval of the project by the board of directors in the first half of we believe that our current capital resources will allow us to proceed 
however  there are a number of factors that could affect final approval of the project  including a significant decline in metals prices  a significant increase in operating or capital costs  or our inability to successfully settle or otherwise manage our existing and potential environmental liabilities relating to historical mining activities in the coeur d alene basin 
an increase in the capital cost could potentially require us to suspend the project or access additional capital though debt financing  the sale of securities  or other external sources 
this additional financing could be costly or unavailable 
our joint development and operating arrangements may not be successful 
we have in the past entered into  and may in the future enter into joint venture arrangements in order to share the risks and costs of developing and operating properties 
in a typical joint venture arrangement  the partners own a proportionate share of the assets  are entitled to indemnification from each other and are only responsible for any future liabilities in proportion to their interest in the joint venture 
if a party fails to perform its obligations under a joint venture agreement  we could incur liabilities and losses in excess of our pro rata share of the joint venture 
we make investments in exploration and development projects that may have to be written off in the event we do not proceed to a commercially viable mining operation 
on february   we announced that our wholly owned subsidiary  rio grande silver inc  acquired the right to earn into a joint venture interest in an approximately square mile consolidated land package in the creede mining district of colorado 
for more information on the terms of the agreement  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our ability to market our metals production may be affected by disruptions or closures of custom smelters and or refining facilities 
we sell substantially all of our metallic concentrates to custom smelters  with our dor bars sent to refiners for further processing before being sold to metal traders 
if our ability to sell concentrates to our contracted smelters becomes unavailable to us  it is possible our operations could be adversely affected 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the distribution of our sales and our significant customers 
we face inherent risks in acquisitions of other mining companies or properties that may adversely impact our growth strategy 
mines have limited lives  which is an inherent risk in acquiring mining properties 
we are actively seeking to expand our mineral reserves by acquiring other mining companies or properties 
although we are pursuing opportunities that we feel are in the best interest of our investors  these pursuits are costly and often unproductive 
inherent risks in acquisitions we may undertake in the future could adversely affect our current business and financial condition and our growth 
there is a limited supply of desirable mineral lands available in the united states and foreign countries where we would consider conducting exploration and or production activities  and any acquisition we may undertake is subject to inherent risks 
in addition to the risk associated with limited mine lives  we may not realize the value of the companies or properties that are acquired due to a possible decline in metals prices  failure to obtain permits  labor problems  changes in regulatory environment  failure to achieve anticipated synergies  an inability to obtain financing and other factors previously described 
acquisitions of other mining companies or properties may also expose us to new geographic  political  operating  and geological risks 
in addition  we face strong competition for companies and properties from other mining companies  some of which have greater financial resources than we do  and we may be unable to acquire attractive companies and mining properties on terms that we consider acceptable 
our business depends on good relations with our employees 
we are dependent upon the ability and experience of our executive officers  managers  employees and other personnel  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain all of such employees 
we compete with other companies both within and outside the mining industry in connection with the recruiting and retention of qualified employees knowledgeable of the mining business 
the loss of these persons or our inability to attract and retain additional highly skilled employees could have an adverse effect on our business and future operations 
the lucky friday mine is our only operation subject to a collective bargaining agreement  and that agreement expires on april  competition from other mining companies may harm our business 
we compete with other mining companies to attract and retain key executives  skilled labor  contractors and other employees 
we compete with other mining companies for the services of skilled personnel and contractors and their specialized equipment  components and supplies  such as drill rigs  necessary for exploration and development 
we also compete with other mining companies for rights to mine properties 
we may be unable to continue to obtain the services of skilled personnel and contractors or specialized equipment or supplies  or to acquire additional rights to mine properties 
mining accidents or other adverse events at an operation could decrease our anticipated production 
production may be reduced below our historical or estimated levels as a result of mining accidents  unfavorable ground conditions  work stoppages or slow downs  lower than expected ore grades  the metallurgical characteristics of the ore that are less economic than anticipated  or our equipment or facilities fail to operate properly or as expected 
for example  in the second quarter of  mining activities at the lucky friday mine stopped for approximately two weeks due to some deterioration of shaft infrastructure at the shaft  which is the mine s secondary escape way 
that stoppage adversely impacted production in the second quarter of upon completion of repairs to shaft  the mine returned to normal production 
our operations may be adversely affected by risks and hazards associated with the mining industry that may not be fully covered by insurance 
our business is capital intensive  requiring ongoing capital investment for the replacement  modernization or expansion of equipment and facility 
the company maintains insurance policies against property loss and business interruption and insures against risks that are typical in the operation of our business  in amounts we believe to be reasonable 
such insurance  however  contains exclusions and limitations on coverage  particularly with respect to environmental liability and political risk 
there can be no assurance that claims would be paid under such insurance policies in connection with a particular event 
our business is subject to a number of risks and hazards including environmental hazards  political and country risks  civil unrest or terrorism  industrial accidents  labor disputes or strikes  unusual or unexpected geologic formations  cave ins  seismic activity  underground fires or floods  explosive rock failures  and unanticipated hydrologic conditions  including flooding and periodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions 
such risks could result in personal injury or fatalities  damage to or destruction of mineral properties or producing facilities  environmental damage  delays in exploration  development or mining  monetary losses  legal liability  and temporary or permanent closure of facilities 
we maintain insurance to protect against losses that may result from some of these risks at levels consistent with our historical experience  industry practice and circumstances surrounding each identified risk 
insurance against environmental risks is generally either unavailable or  we believe  too expensive for us  and we therefore do not maintain environmental insurance 
occurrence of events for which we are not insured may have an adverse effect on our business 
our foreign activities are subject to additional inherent risks 
we sold our mining operations and assets in venezuela in july  but still currently conduct exploration projects in mexico and continue to own assets  real estate and mineral interests there 
we anticipate that we will continue to conduct operations in mexico and possibly other international locations in the future 
because we conduct operations internationally  we are subject to political and economic risks such as the effects of local political  labor and economic developments and unrest  significant or abrupt changes in the applicable regulatory or legal climate  exchange controls and export restrictions  expropriation or nationalization of assets with inadequate compensation  currency fluctuations and repatriation restrictions  invalidation of governmental orders  permits or agreements  renegotiation or nullification of existing concessions  licenses  permits and contracts  corruption  demands for improper payments  expropriation  and uncertain legal enforcement and physical security  disadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to us laws and regulations  fuel or other commodity shortages  illegal mining  laws or policies of foreign countries and the united states affecting trade  investment and taxation  civil disturbances  war and terrorist actions  and seizures of assets 
consequently  our exploration  development and production activities outside of the united states may be substantially affected by factors beyond our control  any of which could materially adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
legal  market and regulatory risks we are currently involved in ongoing legal disputes that may materially adversely affect us 
there are several ongoing legal disputes in which we are involved 
if any of these disputes result in a substantial monetary judgment against us  are settled on terms in excess of our current accruals  or otherwise impact our operations  our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected 
for example  we may ultimately incur environmental remediation costs or the plaintiffs in environmental proceedings may be awarded damages substantially in excess of the amounts we have accrued 
in particular  we face this risk in connection with the coeur d alene basin environmental lawsuit in which the plaintiffs have alleged damages totaling in the billions of dollars and in which hecla limited is the sole remaining defendant 
in february  the negotiators representing hecla  the plaintiffs  and the state of idaho reached an understanding on proposed financial terms to be incorporated into a comprehensive settlement of the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims 
those financial terms of potential settlement are set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
see risk titled the financial terms of proposed settlement that we negotiated with the plaintiffs and the state of idaho s negotiators regarding the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims are non binding and are not final  and complete settlement of the litigation and other claims may not be reached

the financial terms of proposed settlement that we negotiated with the plaintiffs and the state of idaho s negotiators regarding the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims are non binding and are not final  and complete settlement of the litigation and other claims may not be reached 
in february  the negotiators representing hecla  the plaintiffs  and the state of idaho reached an understanding on proposed financial terms to be incorporated into a comprehensive settlement of the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims 
the proposed financial terms would require that we pay in the aggregate million to the plaintiffs and the state of idaho over approximately three years  and provide a limited amount of land to be used as a repository waste site  as part of settling the litigation and other claims 
the proposed financial terms of settlement are set forth in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
any comprehensive settlement would contain additional material terms yet to be negotiated 
while the negotiators have reached an understanding on proposed financial terms  no party has agreed to any of these terms 
thus  these terms are not  at this point  binding on us  the plaintiffs  or the state of idaho until an agreement on all of the other terms of settlement is reached and a consent decree is entered by the court 
on february   the court issued an order giving the parties until april  to file a joint status report regarding settlement efforts and stated no extensions will be given absent a showing of extraordinary cause 
if the negotiators for hecla  the plaintiffs  and the state of idaho do reach a final settlement in the form of a proposed consent decree that they are prepared to recommend to their respective managements and clients  that consent decree will be subject to i approval by the parties management and clients  ii a day public comment period and a period for responses to those public comments and iii approval by the united states district court in idaho 
there can be no assurance that the parties will be successful in negotiating and agreeing on the final terms of the consent decree  or that the consent decree will be entered by the court and thereby become final and binding 
if we are unable to successfully settle the litigation and other claims and have the consent decree entered  it is possible that hecla limited s liability for environmental remediation and other damages in the coeur d alene basin will exceed the amounts we have accrued for such liabilities 
see risk titled our environmental obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
we are required to obtain governmental and lessor approvals and permits in order to conduct mining operations 
in the ordinary course of business  mining companies are required to seek governmental and lessor approvals and permits for expansion of existing operations or for the commencement of new operations 
obtaining the necessary governmental permits is a complex  time consuming and costly process 
the duration and success of our efforts to obtain permits are contingent upon many variables not within our control 
obtaining environmental permits  including the approval of reclamation plans  may increase costs and cause delays depending on the nature of the activity to be permitted and the interpretation of applicable requirements implemented by the permitting authority 
there can be no assurance that all necessary approvals and permits will be obtained and  if obtained  that the costs involved will not exceed those that we previously estimated 
it is possible that the costs and delays associated with the compliance with such standards and regulations could become such that we would not proceed with the development or operation 
we are required to post surety bonds or cash collateral to secure our reclamation obligations and we may be unable to obtain the required surety bonds or may not have the resources to provide cash collateral 
we face substantial governmental regulation and environmental risk 
our business is subject to extensive us and foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations governing development  production  labor standards  occupational health  waste disposal  use of toxic substances  environmental regulations  mine safety and other matters 
for example  in both of our operating mines received several citations under the mine safety and health act of  as administered by the federal mine safety and health administration 
further  we have been and are currently involved in lawsuits or disputes in which we have been accused of causing environmental damage  violating environmental laws  or violating environmental permits  and we may be subject to similar lawsuits or disputes in the future 
see risk titled our environmental obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
for example  in late and during  hecla limited experienced a number of alleged water permit exceedances for water discharges at its lucky friday unit 
the alleged violations resulted in hecla limited entering into a consent agreement and final order cafo and a compliance order with the epa in april  which included an extended compliance timeline 
in connection with the cafo  hecla limited agreed to pay an administrative penalty to the epa of  to settle any liability for such exceedances 
the alleged violations were the subject of a december letter from the epa informing hecla limited that epa is prepared to seek civil penalties for these alleged violations  as well as for alleged unpermitted discharges of waste water in at the lucky friday unit 
in the same letter  epa invited hecla limited to discuss these matters with them prior to filing a complaint 
hecla limited disputes epa s assertions  but has begun negotiations with epa in an attempt to resolve these matters 
hecla limited has undertaken efforts to bring its water discharges at the lucky friday unit into compliance with the permit  but cannot provide assurances that it will be able to fully comply with the permit limits in the future 
any future non compliance with the permit limits or other regulatory or environmental requirements could lead to future penalties  regulatory or other legal action  damages  or otherwise impact our operations and financial results 
in addition to existing regulatory requirements  legislation and regulations may be adopted or permit limits reduced at any time that result in additional operating expense  capital expenditures or restrictions and delays in the mining  production or development of our properties 
in addition  enforcement or regulatory tools and methods available to governmental regulators such as the us environmental protection agency which have not been used or seldomly used against us  could in the future be used against us 
legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and green house gas emissions are in various phases of consideration 
if adopted  such measures could increase our cost of environmental compliance and also delay or otherwise negatively affect efforts to obtain permits and other regulatory approvals with regard to existing and new facilities 
proposed measures could also result in increased cost of fuel and other consumables used at our operations  including the diesel generation of electricity at our greens creek operation if we are unable to access utility power 
climate change legislation may also affect our smelter customers who burn fossil fuels  resulting in increased costs to us  and may affect the market for the metals we produce with effects on prices that are not possible for us to predict 
from time to time  the us congress considers proposed amendments to the general mining law of  as amended  which governs mining claims and related activities on federal lands 
the extent of any future changes is not known and the potential impact on us as a result of us congressional action is difficult to predict 
changes to the general mining law  if adopted  could adversely affect our ability to economically develop mineral reserves on federal lands 
although we are not currently mining on federal land  exploration and future mining could occur on federal land 
our environmental obligations may exceed the provisions we have made 
we are subject to significant environmental obligations  particularly in northern idaho through our subsidiary hecla limited 
at december   we had accrued million as a provision for environmental obligations  including million accrued for hecla limited s various liabilities in idaho 
as of the date of this report  these accrual balances included a total of million for environmental claims with respect to the entire coeur d alene basin basin  including the box  in northern idaho 
these accrual balances include an increase of million in the fourth quarter of as a result of negotiators representing hecla  the plaintiffs  and the state of idaho with respect to the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims reaching an understanding on proposed financial terms to be incorporated into a comprehensive settlement that would contain additional terms yet to be negotiated 
despite reaching such an understanding  there is no guarantee that final settlement terms will be reached and a consent decree entered 
if we are unable to successfully settle the litigation and have a consent decree entered  it is possible that hecla limited s liability for environmental remediation and other damages in the coeur d alene basin will exceed the amounts we have accrued for such liabilities 
for an overview of our potential environmental liabilities  see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the titles to some of our properties may be defective or challenged 
unpatented mining claims constitute a significant portion of our undeveloped property holdings  the validity of which could be uncertain and may be contested 
although we have conducted title reviews of our property holdings  title review does not necessarily preclude third parties from challenging our title 
in accordance with mining industry practice  we do not generally obtain title opinions until we decide to develop a property 
therefore  while we have attempted to acquire satisfactory title to our undeveloped properties  some titles may be defective 
the price of our stock has a history of volatility and could decline in the future 
our common and preferred stocks are listed on the new york stock exchange 
the market price for our stock has been volatile  often based on changes in metals prices  particularly silver  our results of operations and financial condition as reflected in our public news releases or periodic filings with the securities and exchange commission  fluctuating proven and probable reserves  factors unrelated to our financial performance or future prospects  such as global economic developments  market perceptions of the attractiveness of particular industries  or the reliability of metals markets  political and regulatory risk  the success of our exploration programs  ability to meet production estimates  environmental and legal risk  the extent of analytical coverage concerning our business  and the trading volume and general market interest in our securities 
the market price of our stock at any given point in time may not accurately reflect our value  and may prevent shareholders from realizing a profit on their investment 
our series b preferred stock has a liquidation preference of per share or million 
if we were liquidated  holders of our preferred stock would be entitled to receive approximately million plus any accrued and unpaid dividends from any liquidation proceeds before holders of our common stock would be entitled to receive any proceeds 
we may not be able to pay preferred stock dividends in the future 
since july  we paid regular quarterly dividends on our series b preferred stock through the third quarter of the annual dividend payable on the series b preferred stock is currently million 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we had not declared preferred dividends on series b preferred stock since the second quarter of series b preferred stock dividends due on january   for the fourth quarter of and dividends due for the three quarters thereafter were deferred 
in january we paid all dividends in arrears and dividends due for the fourth quarter of for the series b preferred stock  and we paid all regular quarterly dividends for however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future 
additional issuances of equity securities by us would dilute the ownership of our existing stockholders and could reduce our earnings per share 
we may issue equity in the future in connection with acquisitions  strategic transactions or for other purposes  including funding our obligations under any settlement of litigation of other claims 
any such acquisition could be material to us and could significantly increase the size and scope of our business  including our market capitalization 
to the extent we issue any additional equity securities  the ownership of our existing stockholders would be diluted and our earnings per share could be reduced 
as of december   there were warrants outstanding for purchase of  shares of our common stock 
the warrants give the holders the right to purchase our common stock at the following prices  shares   shares  and  shares 
the remaining warrants expire in june and august see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the issuance of additional shares of our preferred stock or common stock in the future could adversely affect holders of common stock 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by our preferred stock 
for example  the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by our failure to pay dividends on our currently outstanding series b preferred stock  which would prevent us from paying dividends to holders of our common stock 
in addition  our board of directors is authorized to issue additional classes or series of preferred stock without any action on the part of our stockholders 
this includes the power to set the terms of any such classes or series of preferred stock that may be issued  including voting rights  dividend rights and preferences over common stock with respect to dividends or upon the liquidation  dissolution or winding up of the business and other terms 
if we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to the payment of dividends or upon liquidation  dissolution or winding up  or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock  the rights of holders of the common stock or the market price of the common stock could be adversely affected 
we may issue substantial additional shares of common stock or other securities in connection with acquisitions  strategic transactions or for other purposes  including funding of our obligations under any settlement of litigation or other claims  to the extent permitted by our credit facility 
any such acquisition could be material to us and could significantly increase the size and scope of our business 
issuances or sales of substantial amounts of additional common stock or the perception that such issuances or sales could occur may cause prevailing market prices for our common stock to decline and could result in dilution to our stockholders 
as noted above  as of december   there were warrants outstanding to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock 
as described in note to notes to consolidated financial statements  we issued million shares of our common stock in january of in connection with conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock 
if a large number of shares of our common stock are sold in the public market  the sales could reduce the trading price of our common stock  impede our ability to raise future capital 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  future issuances by us of our common stock or other equity will have on the market price of our common stock 
in addition  shares of our common stock that we issue in connection with an acquisition may not be subject to resale restrictions 
we may issue substantial additional shares of common stock or other securities in connection with material acquisition transactions or for other purposes  including funding of our obligations under any settlement of litigation or other claims 
the market price of our common stock could decline if certain large holders of our common stock  or recipients of our common stock  sell all or a significant portion of their shares of common stock or are perceived by the market as intending to sell these shares other than in an orderly manner 
in addition  these sales could also impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional common stock in the capital markets 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could delay or deter tender offers or takeover attempts that may offer a premium for our common stock 
the provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us  even if that transaction would be beneficial to stockholders 
these impediments include the classification of our board of directors into three classes serving staggered three year terms  which makes it more difficult to quickly replace board members  the ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock with rights as it deems appropriate without stockholder approval  a provision that special meetings of our board of directors may be called only by our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors  a provision that special meetings of stockholders may only be called pursuant to a resolution approved by a majority of our entire board of directors  a prohibition against action by written consent of our stockholders  a provision that our board members may only be removed for cause and by an affirmative vote of at least of the outstanding voting stock  a provision that our stockholders comply with advance notice provisions to bring director nominations or other matters before meetings of our stockholders  a prohibition against certain business combinations with an acquirer of or more of our common stock for three years after such acquisition unless the stock acquisition or the business combination is approved by our board prior to the acquisition of the interest  or after such acquisition our board and the holders of two thirds of the other common stock approve the business combination  and a prohibition against our entering into certain business combinations with interested stockholders without the affirmative vote of the holders of at least of the voting power of the then outstanding shares of voting stock 
the existence of these provisions may deprive stockholders of an opportunity to sell our stock at a premium over prevailing prices 
the potential inability of our stockholders to obtain a control premium could adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
if we cannot meet the new york stock exchange continued listing requirements  the nyse may delist our common stock 
our common stock is currently listed on the nyse 
in the future  if we are not be able to meet the continued listing requirements of the nyse  which require  among other things  that the average closing price of our common stock be above over consecutive trading days  our common stock may be delisted 
our closing stock price on february  was 
the closing price of our common stock was last below for over consecutive trading days was during the second quarter of if we are unable to satisfy the nyse criteria for continued listing  our common stock would be subject to delisting 
a delisting of our common stock could negatively impact us by  among other things  reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock  reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock  which could negatively impact our ability to raise equity financing  decreasing the amount of news and analyst coverage for the company  and limiting our ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future 
in addition  delisting from the nyse might negatively impact our reputation and  as a consequence  our business

item property descriptions operating properties the greens creek unit our various subsidiaries own of the greens creek mine  located in southeast alaska  which has been in production since  with a temporary care and maintenance period from april through july since the start of production  greens creek has been owned and operated through various joint venture arrangements involving a variety of partners  including us 
for approximately years prior to april   our wholly owned subsidiary  hecla alaska llc  owned an undivided joint venture interest in the assets of greens creek 
on april   we completed the acquisition of all of the equity of two rio tinto subsidiaries holding a interest in the greens creek mine for approximately million 
the acquisition gives our various subsidiaries control of of the greens creek mine 
the greens creek orebody contains silver  zinc  gold and lead  and lies adjacent to the admiralty island national monument  an environmentally sensitive area 
the greens creek property includes patented lode claims and one patented mill site claim  in addition to property leased from the us forest service 
greens creek also has title to mineral rights on  acres of federal land adjacent to the properties 
the entire project is accessed by boat and served by miles of road and consists of the mine  an ore concentrating mill  a tailings impoundment area  a ship loading facility  camp facilities and a ferry dock 
the map below illustrates the location and access to greens creek the greens creek deposit is a polymetallic  stratiform  massive sulfide deposit 
the host rock consists of predominantly marine sedimentary  and mafic to ultramafic volcanic and plutonic rocks  which have been subjected to multiple periods of deformation 
these deformational episodes have imposed intense tectonic fabrics on the rocks 
mineralization occurs discontinuously along the contact between a structural hanging wall of quartz mica carbonate phyllites and a structural footwall of graphitic and calcareous argillite 
major sulfide minerals are pyrite  sphalerite  galena  and tetrahedrite tennanite 
pursuant to a land exchange agreement  the joint venture transferred private property equal to a value of million to the us forest service and received exploration and mining rights to approximately  acres of land with mining potential surrounding the existing mine 
production from new ore discoveries on the exchanged lands will be subject to federal royalties included in the land exchange agreement 
the royalty is only due on production from reserves that are not part of greens creek s extralateral rights 
thus far  there has been no production triggering payment of the royalty 
the royalty is if the average value of the ore during a year is greater than per ton of ore  and if the value is per ton or less 
the benchmark of per ton is adjusted annually according to the gross domestic product gdp implicit price deflator until the year  and at december   was at approximately per ton when applying the latest gdp implicit price deflator observation 
greens creek is an underground mine which produces approximately  tons of ore per day 
the primary mining methods are cut and fill and longhole stoping 
the ore is processed on site at a mill  which produces lead  zinc and bulk concentrates  as well as gold dor 
in  ore was processed at an average rate of approximately  tons per day 
during  mill recovery totaled approximately silver  zinc  lead and gold 
the dor is further refined by precious metal refiners and sold to banks  and the three concentrate products are sold to a number of major smelters worldwide 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the significant customers for greens creek s products 
concentrates are shipped from a marine terminal located on admiralty island about nine miles from the mine site 
electricity for the greens creek unit has historically been provided by diesel generators located on site 
however  an agreement was reached during to purchase excess hydroelectric power from the local power company  alaska electric light and power company ael p 
installation of the necessary infrastructure was completed in  and use of hydroelectric power commenced during the third quarter of the infrastructure is also used to provide power to surrounding communities 
this project has reduced production costs at greens creek to the extent power has been available 
low lake levels and increased demand in the juneau area combined to restrict the amount of power available to greens creek prior to in and  the mine received an increased proportion of its power needs from ael p 
however  when weather conditions are not favorable to maintain lake water levels  the mine relies on diesel generated power 
the employees at greens creek are employees of hecla greens creek mining company  our wholly owned subsidiary  and are not represented by a bargaining agent 
there were employees at the greens creek unit at december  as of december   we have recorded a million asset retirement obligation for reclamation and closure costs 
we maintain a million reclamation bond secured by the restricted cash balance of million for greens creek 
the net book value of the greens creek unit property and its associated plant  equipment and mineral interests was approximately million as of december  information with respect to production  average costs per ounce of silver produced and proven and probable ore reserves is set forth in the following table  and represents our ownership of greens creek after april   and our previous ownership prior to that date

cash costs per ounce of silver represent measurements that are not in accordance with gaap that management uses to monitor and evaluate the performance of our mining operations 
we believe cash costs per ounce of silver provide an indicator of economic performance and efficiency at each location and on a consolidated basis  as well as providing a meaningful basis to compare our results to those of other mining companies and other mining operating properties 
a reconciliation of this non gaap measure to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  the most comparable gaap measure  can be found in item md a  under reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to costs of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap 
estimates of proven and probable ore reserves for the greens creek unit as of december  and are calculated and reviewed in house and are derived from successive generations of reserve and feasibility analyses for different areas of the mine  using a separate assessment of metals prices for each year 
the average prices used for the greens creek unit were december  silver per ounce gold per ounce lead per pound zinc per pound ore reserves represent in place material  diluted and adjusted for expected mining recovery 
mill recoveries of ore reserve grades differ by ore zones and are expected to average for silver  for gold  for zinc and for lead 
the changes in reserves in versus are due to the lower ore grades combined with continued depletion of the deposit  partially offset by increases in forecasted metals prices and additional drilling at the east ore zone 
the changes in reserves in versus were due to lower anticipated ore grades and depletion due to production  partially offset by the addition of new drill data and increases in forecasted precious metals prices 
we only report probable reserves at the greens creek unit  which are based on average drill spacing of to feet 
proven reserves typically require that mining samples are partly the basis of the ore grade estimates used  while probable reserve grade estimates can be based entirely on drilling results 
cutoff grade assumptions vary by orebody and are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and smelter payables and cash operating costs 
due to multiple ore metals  and complex combinations of ore types  metal ratios and metallurgical performances at greens creek  the cutoff grade is expressed in terms of net smelter return nsr  rather than metal grade 
the cutoff grade was per ton nsr 
greens creek ore reserve estimates were prepared by lourens smuts  senior resource geologist at the greens creek unit and reviewed by john taylor  senior resource geologist at hecla limited 
an independent review by amec e c  inc was completed in for the reserve models for the and a zones 
the lucky friday unit since  we have owned and operated the lucky friday unit  a deep underground silver  lead and zinc mine located in the coeur d alene mining district in northern idaho 
lucky friday is one quarter mile east of mullan  idaho  and is adjacent to us interstate below is a map illustrating the location and access to the lucky friday unit there have been two ore bearing structures mined at the lucky friday unit 
the first  mined through  was the lucky friday vein  a fissure vein typical of many in the coeur d alene mining district 
the ore body is located in the revett formation  which is known to provide excellent host rocks for a number of ore bodies in the coeur d alene mining district 
the lucky friday vein strikes northeasterly and dips steeply to the south with an average width of six to seven feet 
its principal ore minerals are galena and tetrahedrite with minor amounts of sphalerite and chalcopyrite 
the ore occurs as a single continuous ore body in and along the lucky friday vein 
the major part of the ore body has extended from  feet to  feet below surface 
the second ore bearing structure  known as the lucky friday expansion area  has been mined since pursuant to an operating agreement with silver hunter mining company silver hunter  our wholly owned subsidiary 
during  we discovered several mineralized structures containing some high grade silver ores in an area known as the gold hunter property  approximately  feet northwest of the then existing lucky friday workings 
this discovery led to the development of the gold hunter property on the level 
on november   we  through silver hunter  completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of independence lead mines company independence  including all future interest or royalty obligation to independence and the mining claims pertaining to the operating agreement with hecla limited that was assigned to silver hunter see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the principal mining method at the lucky friday unit is ramp access  cut and fill 
this method utilizes rubber tired equipment to access the veins through ramps developed outside of the ore body 
once a cut is taken along the strike of the vein  it is backfilled with cemented tailings and the next cut is accessed  either above or below  from the ramp system 
the ore produced from lucky friday is processed in a conventional flotation mill  which produces both a lead concentrate and a zinc concentrate 
in  ore was processed at an average rate of approximately tons per day 
during  mill recovery totaled approximately silver  lead and zinc 
all silver lead and zinc concentrate production during was shipped to teck cominco limited s smelter in trail  british columbia  canada 
information with respect to the lucky friday unit s production  average cost per ounce of silver produced and proven and probable ore reserves for the past three years is set forth in the table below

proven and probable ore reserves are calculated and reviewed in house and are subject to periodic audit by others  although audits are not performed on an annual basis 
cutoff grade assumptions vary by ore body and are developed based on reserve prices  anticipated mill recoveries and smelter payables and cash operating costs 
due to multiple ore metals  and complex combinations of ore types  metal ratios and metallurgical performances at the lucky friday  the cutoff grade is expressed in terms of net smelter return nsr  rather than metal grade 
the cutoff grade at the lucky friday ranges from per ton nsr to per ton nsr 
our estimates of proven and probable reserves are based on the following metals prices december  silver per ounce lead per pound zinc per pound reserves are in place materials that incorporate estimates of the amount of waste that must be mined along with the ore and expected mining recovery 
mill recoveries are expected to be for silver  for lead and for zinc 
zinc recovery has improved from historical levels due to mill upgrades completed during  and the changes in reserves in versus  and in versus  are due to addition of data from new drill holes and development work  higher anticipated ore grades  and increases in forecasted metals prices  which has resulted in the addition of new reserves based on updated estimates  partially offset by depletion due to production 
the change in reserves in versus is also attributed to potential expansion of the mine plan resulting from deeper access beyond the current workings due to anticipated construction of the shaft 
lucky friday ore reserve estimates were prepared by terry devoe  chief geologist at the lucky friday unit and reviewed by john taylor  senior resource geologist at hecla limited 
an independent audit by scott wilson roscoe postle associates inc was completed in january for the reserve model at the lucky friday mine 
during  we initiated engineering  procurement and development activities relating to construction of shaft at the lucky friday mine  which  upon completion  would provide access from the level down to the of the mine 
the project was temporarily placed on hold in the fourth quarter of due to then prevailing metals prices 
however  detailed engineering  long lead time procurement  and other early stage activities for the internal shaft project resumed in activities in included engineering  erection of a surface concrete batch plant  and work on shaft  including detailed shaft design  excavation of the hoist room and off shaft development access to shaft facilities  placement and receipt of orders for major equipment purchases  and other early construction activities 
upon completion  shaft would allow us to mine mineralized material below our current workings and provide deeper platforms for exploration 
construction of shaft would take approximately four more years to complete  and capital expenditures for the project would total approximately million  including approximately million spent on the project through december  our management currently expects to seek final approval of the project by the board of directors in the first half of we believe that our current capital resources will allow us to proceed 
however  there are a number of factors that could affect final approval of the project  including a significant decline in metals prices  a significant increase in operating or capital costs  or our inability to successfully settle or otherwise manage our potential environmental liabilities relating to historical mining activities in the coeur d alene basin 
an increase in the capital cost could potentially require us to suspend the project or access additional capital though debt financing  the sale of securities  or other external sources 
this additional financing could be costly or unavailable 
ultimate reclamation activities are anticipated to include stabilization of tailings ponds and waste rock areas 
no final reclamation activities were performed in  and at december   an asset retirement obligation of approximately million had been recorded for reclamation and closure costs 
the net book value of the lucky friday unit property and its associated plant  equipment and mineral interests was approximately million as of december  the construction of the facilities at lucky friday ranges from the s to the plant is maintained by our employees with assistance from outside contractors as required 
at december   there were employees at the lucky friday unit

the cash dividend declared for the fourth quarter of  which was paid in january  represents the last dividend to be paid on the mandatory convertible preferred stock  which automatically converted to shares of our common stock on january on april   we completed the acquisition of all of the equity of two rio tinto subsidiaries holding a interest in the greens creek mine for approximately million 
the acquisition gives our various subsidiaries control of of the greens creek mine 
our operating results reflect our ownership of greens creek after april  and our ownership of greens creek prior to that date 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisition 
on july   we completed the sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of el callao gold mining company and drake bering holdings bv  our wholly owned subsidiaries which together owned our business and operations in venezuela  the la camorra unit 
the results of the venezuelan operations have been reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview established in in northern idaho s silver valley  we believe we are the oldest precious metals mining company in the united states still operating and the largest silver producer in the us our corporate offices are in coeur d alene  idaho and vancouver  british columbia 
our production profile includes silver  gold  lead  and zinc contained in concentrates shipped to various smelters  and gold dor 
our operating properties comprise our two business segments for financial reporting purposes the greens creek operating unit on admiralty island in alaska and the lucky friday operating unit in idaho 
since both of our mines are located in the us  we believe they have low political risk  and less economic risk than mines located in other parts of the world 
our exploration interests are located in jurisdictions with low and relatively moderate political and economic risk in the united states and mexico  respectively  and are located in historically successful mining districts 
our operating and strategic framework is based on expanding our production and locating and developing new resource potential 
in  we attained record revenue of million  gross profit of million  and cash flow from operating activities of million  surpassing s previous record levels as a result of higher metals prices 
our acquisition of the remaining interest of the greens creek mine near juneau  alaska in also contributed to our performance in both years 
committed a record level of capital investment at our existing operations  with capital expenditures in totaling approximately million  including million at lucky friday and million at greens creek 
we advanced preliminary work on construction of an internal shaft at the lucky friday unit 
increased overall proven and probable reserves at december  compared to their levels at the same time last year  with higher reserves at lucky friday due to the addition of data from new drill holes and development work  higher anticipated ore grades  increases in forecasted metals prices  and the potential expansion of the mine plan resulting from deeper access beyond the current workings due to anticipated construction of the shaft 
the increase in reserves at lucky friday was partially offset by a slight decrease in reserves at greens creek in due to lower ore grades and depletion of the deposit through production 
produced new record ore volume at our lucky friday mine near mullan  idaho  exceeding s record throughput 
significantly boosted our financial liquidity  with a cash and cash equivalents balance of over million and no debt at the end of the year 
increased our exploration spending during the year by in comparison to  drilling targets at each of our four land packages in alaska  idaho  colorado  and mexico 
in addition to these significant developments  in february  the negotiators representing hecla  the united states and the coeur d alene indian tribe plaintiffs  and the state of idaho reached an understanding on proposed financial terms to be incorporated into a comprehensive settlement of the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims that would contain additional terms yet to be negotiated 
as a result of such negotiations  we recorded a million provision in the fourth quarter of  increasing hecla limited s total liability for past response costs  future remediation and natural resource damages in the entire coeur d alene basin  including the box  to million 
see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the global financial crisis and recession affected us in and  and demonstrated the high volatility of metals prices 
after seeing the silver price fall from a high of in to a low of for the same year  we saw prices rebound to an average of for  and a continuation of this trend to an average silver price of for and for the fourth quarter of similar volatility was shown by our important base metals by products  lead and zinc  which fell by two thirds during  but have since rebounded to levels double their low points in the increased exposure to metals prices resulting from our ownership of of greens creek  combined with the continuation of cost controls put into place in to address the impact of the global financial crisis  put us in a position to benefit significantly from the metals price recovery and achieve the milestones described above 
in spite of higher mill throughput at both greens creek and lucky friday  our production of silver in decreased slightly to million ounces from a record million ounces in due to lower silver ore grades at both operations 
however  production of lead and zinc  important by products at our lucky friday and greens creek mines  increased to new record levels in due to higher ore volumes at both operations 
consequently  revenues in of million represented a increase over revenues of million  with the increase primarily due to higher realized metal prices 
we reported diluted income per share of in compared to in gross profit from operations improved to million in from million in primarily as a result of higher realized prices for all four metals we sell 
exploration costs were higher in due to ramping up of efforts curtailed in we recorded net losses on impairments of investments and dispositions of fixed assets  net of gains on sales of investments of million in versus a net gain of million in provision for closed operations and environmental matters increased by million in due primarily to an increase in our estimated liability for environmental obligations in idaho s coeur d alene basin 
in  we recorded an million income tax benefit from a decreased valuation allowance on deferred tax assets compared to a million benefit recorded in our deferred tax asset balances are recorded net of an offsetting valuation allowance to the extent that we estimate that the assets are not realizable through future taxable income 
we removed substantially all of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of significant evidence in  including record cash flows from operations and higher metals prices  led us to conclude that our deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable through estimated future profitability 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the factors driving metals prices are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
as noted above  prices have been highly volatile in the last three years and could be so in the future 
average prices in compared to those in and are illustrated in the results of operations section below 
moreover  variations in the metal grades of ore mined are impacted by geology and mine planning efficiencies and operations  potentially creating constraints on metals produced 
ore transportation and smelting schedules also impact the timing of sales and final settlement 
key issues we intend to achieve our long term strategy of increasing production and expanding our proven and probable reserves through development and exploration  as well as by future acquisitions 
our strategic plan requires that we manage several pervasive challenges and risks inherent in conducting mining  development  exploration and metal sales at multiple locations 
one such risk involves metals prices  over which we have no control except through derivative and other contracts 
while the metals mining industry enjoyed continued strength in metals prices from through mid  prices have been highly volatile  falling sharply in the last quarter of and recovering through and into industrial demand of silver is closely linked to world gdp growth and to industrial fabrication levels  as it is difficult to substitute for silver in industrial fabrication 
we believe that global economic conditions are continuing to improve and that industrial trends  including growth of the middle class in countries like china and india  will result in continued consumer and industrial demand for silver 
investment demand for silver and gold has been relatively strong for the past three years and is influenced by various factors  including the strength of the us dollar and other currencies  expanding us budget deficits  widening availability of exchange traded commodity funds  interest rate levels  the health of credit markets  and inflationary expectations 
uncertainty concerning the continued progress of global economic recovery could result in continued investment demand for precious metals 
however  there can be no assurance whether these trends will continue or how they will impact prices of the metals we produce 
we make our strategic plans in the context of significant uncertainty about future revenues  which may impact new opportunities that require many years and substantial cost from discovery to production 
we approach this challenge by investing in exploration and capital in districts with an established history of success  and in managing our operations in a manner that seeks to mitigate the effects of lower prices 
we significantly increased our exploration activity in compared to  and we anticipate a further increase in exploration activity in the coming year at or near our operating mines at greens creek and lucky friday  as well as at our exploration projects in the past producing mining districts in colorado and mexico 
as a result of continued improvement in our financial condition  available capital resources  and strong operating performance  we believe that we are well positioned to seek opportunities for growth through both acquisitions and expansion of our current operations 
one such opportunity involves the construction of the shaft  an internal shaft at our lucky friday mine  which  we believe  could significantly increase production and extend the life of the mine 
we have commenced with engineering and construction activities on shaft  and management plans to seek final approval of the project by the board of directors in mid see additional discussion in the lucky friday segment section below 
if approved  construction of shaft as currently designed is expected to cost a total of approximately million  including approximately million that that has been spent as of december   and take an additional four years to complete 
we believe that our current capital resources will allow us to proceed 
however  there are a number of factors that could affect completion of the project  including a significant decline in metals prices  a reduction in cash available  whether arising from decreased cash flow or other uses of available cash  a significant increase in operating or capital costs  or our inability to successfully settle or otherwise manage our existing and potential environmental liabilities relating to historical mining activities in the coeur d alene basin 
volatility in global financial markets poses a significant challenge to our ability to access credit and equity markets  should we need to do so  and to predict sales prices for our products 
our stock price has rebounded from its lowest levels in we eliminated our debt in partly by increasing our shares of common stock outstanding by during and issuing warrants at exercises prices ranging from to per share 
our shares of common stock outstanding increased by an additional in primarily as a result of exercises of warrants issued in and  and by an additional on january  as a result of the conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock 
we have also entered into a three year  million revolving credit agreement under which there are no outstanding borrowings as of december   yet our ability to retain the facility depends in part on financial thresholds driven by the prices of products we sell 
another challenge is the risk associated with environmental litigation and ongoing reclamation activities 
as described in item a 
risk factors and note of notes to consolidated financial statements  it is possible that our estimate of these liabilities may change in the future  affecting our strategic plans 
for example  the epa has released for public comment its proposed plan for remediation of the upper portion of the coeur d alene basin  a plan with an estimated present value cost of billion and duration of between and years 
this plan represents a significant increase from the epa s interim record of decision with its estimated cost of million for both the upper and lower portions of the basin 
we do not know the extent to which the epa s proposal will be ultimately implemented  its effect on current operations in the basin  or how hecla limited s liability for environmental damages could be affected 
as also discussed in notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements  although we have resumed settlement negotiations  and we believe we have reached an understanding on the proposed financial terms of potential settlement with the plaintiffs in the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and the state of idaho  no assurance can be given that final settlement will be reached and a consent decree entered 
because the uncertainty surrounding settlement efforts and the status of the epa s proposed remediation plan makes calculating accruals and planning for our business generally more difficult and uncertain  we believe resolving such litigation during would assist our planning efforts and decrease uncertainty regarding our liability and our liquidity needs 
see item a 
risk factors legal  market and regulatory risks the financial terms of settlement that we negotiated with the plaintiffs in the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation  and the state of idaho  are non binding  and complete settlement of the litigation and other claims may not be reached 
in addition  proposed measures to address climate change and green house gas emissions could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance in the future see item a 
risk factors legal  market and regulatory risks we face substantial governmental regulation and environmental risk 
we intend to continue to strive to ensure that our activities are conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to attempt to settle the environmental litigation 
reserve estimation is a major risk inherent in mining 
our reserve estimates  which drive our mining and investment plans and many of our costs  may change based on economic factors and actual production experience 
until ore is actually mined and processed  the volumes and grades of our reserves must be considered as estimates 
our reserves are depleted as we mine 
reserves can also change as a result of changes in metals prices and costs  as well as economic and operating assumptions 
we strive to achieve excellent mine safety and health performance 
we seek to implement this goal by training employees in safe work practices  openly communicating with employees  establishing  following and improving safety standards  investigating accidents  incidents and losses to avoid reoccurrence  and involving employees in the establishment of safety standards 
we attempt to implement reasonable best practices with respect to mine safety and emergency preparedness 
as a result of industry wide fatal accidents in recent years  primarily at underground coal mines  there has been an increase in mining regulation in the united states 
this increase has taken the form of vigorous enforcement of existing laws and regulations  and the adoption of new safety and training regulations  primarily by the us labor department s mine safety and health administration 
in addition  under the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act  the securities and exchange commission was directed to issue new rules regarding the disclosure of mine safety data 
these changes may have a significant effect on our future operating costs  in the form of increased costs for monitoring and administration of and by regulatory agencies 
furthermore  to the extent our competitors operate their mines in a less regulated jurisdiction  we may be disadvantaged 
results of operations for the year ended december   we reported income applicable to common shareholders of million compared to income applicable to common shareholders of million in and a loss applicable to common shareholders of million in the following factors had a positive impact on results for the year ended december  compared to and increased gross profit at our greens creek and lucky friday units in compared to and see the greens creek segment and lucky friday segment sections below for further discussion of operating results 
valuation allowance adjustments to our deferred tax asset balances contributed to reporting a million income tax benefit in compared to a million income tax benefit recognized in and a million income tax provision in these adjustments are included in the aggregate income tax benefit provision for each respective period 
our deferred tax asset balances are recorded net of an offsetting valuation allowance to the extent that we estimate that the assets are not realizable through future taxable income 
in the fourth quarter of  we removed substantially all of the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
significant evidence in  including record cash flows from operations and higher metals prices  led us to conclude that our deferred tax assets are more likely than not realizable due to estimated future profitability 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
loss from discontinued operations and a loss on sale of the now divested la camorra unit for the year ended december  for a total of million 
there were no such comparable losses reported in or as we completed the sale of our discontinued venezuelan operations in july see the discontinued operations la camorra unit section below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest expense  net of interest capitalized  decreased to million in from million in and million for the year ended december  due to repayment in of debt incurred for the acquisition of the remaining ownership interest in greens creek 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our debt facilities 
higher debt related fees in due to million in expense recognized in the first quarter of for preferred stock issued pursuant to our amended and restated credit agreement and million in professional fees incurred in related to compliance with our amended and restated credit agreement 
see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
in the second quarter of we recognized a million loss on impairment of shares of rusoro stock received in the sale of our discontinued venezuelan operations compared to a million impairment loss recognized on the rusoro stock recognized during the second quarter of see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
higher average prices for all four metals produced at our operations in compared to and the following table summarizes average market prices and our realized prices for silver  gold  lead and zinc for the years ended december   and average for the year ended december  silver london pm fix ounce realized price per ounce gold london pm fix ounce realized price per ounce lead lme final cash buyer pound realized price per pound zinc lme final cash buyer pound realized price per pound the differences between realized metal prices and average market prices are due to timing of sales and settlements  including provisional price adjustments and gains and losses on zinc and lead forward contracts included in our revenues resulting from the difference between metal prices upon transfer of title of concentrates to the buyer and metal prices at the time of final settlement 
these differences arise from our accounting policy on revenue recognition 
concentrate sales are generally recorded as revenues at the time of shipment from our location at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement  which may extend up to four months after shipment 
due to the time elapsed between shipment of concentrates and final settlement with the buyers  we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled 
previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metal prices each period through final settlement 
for  we recorded positive price adjustments to provisional settlements of million compared to positive price adjustments of million in and negative price adjustments of million in the price adjustments for attributable to zinc and lead were partially offset by net losses on forward contracts for those metals initiated in the second quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
the net losses on these forward contracts are included in revenues and impact the realized prices for zinc and lead 
we recognized a net loss on the contracts of million in other significant variances affecting the comparison of our income applicable to common shareholders for to results for and were as follows an accrual of million to increase our liability for environmental obligations in idaho s coeur d alene basin pursuant to negotiations with the plaintiffs in the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and the state of idaho on the financial terms of potential settlement of the litigation and related claims 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an increase of approximately million to our estimated liabilities for environmental remediation at our grouse creek unit million and the bunker hill superfund site million as a result of revisions to the reclamation work plans 
for additional discussion  see coeur d alene river basin environmental claims in notes and of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
a million net loss on base metal derivative contracts in  with no comparable events in and the losses primarily represent non cash  mark to market adjustments on outstanding financially settled forward contracts related to forecasted zinc and lead production as a part of a risk management program initiated in the second quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our derivatives contracts 
exploration expense of million in compared to million in and million in the increase in compared to is due to the resumption  following a lower level of activity in imposed by financial circumstances  of exploration activity at or near our current operations at the greens creek and lucky friday units  at the san juan silver project in colorado  and at our san sebastian unit in mexico

the increase in gross profit for compared to and was primarily the result of the following factors higher average market and realized prices in for all four metals produced at greens creek compared to and  as further discussed in results of operations above 
positive price adjustments to revenues of million  net of base metal forward contract losses  during compared to million in the price adjustments in and were favorable compared to the million in negative price adjustments recorded in price adjustments to revenues result from changes in metals prices between transfer of title of concentrates to buyers and final settlements during the period 
positive price adjustments for lead and zinc in were substantially offset by net losses on million on financially settled forward contracts 
the base metal forward contract program was initiated in april  and there were no comparable losses impacting and gross profit 
higher zinc and lead ore grades which  coupled with slightly higher mill throughput  resulted in increased production of those metals in production costs per ton of ore milled for remained within of their levels  which decreased by compared to the lower costs in and are primarily due to increased availability of hydroelectric power  cost reduction efforts  lower diesel prices and improved ore production 
an increase in our share of production due to our acquisition of the remaining of greens creek in april cost of sales in included the excess of fair value over cost of the finished and in process product inventory acquired upon purchase of the ownership interest 
upon the sale of the acquired inventory  the excess of fair market value over costs was expensed  which increased cost of sales and decreased gross profit margin in by million 
these factors were partially offset by a silver ore grade in that was lower than the ore grade in and lower than the ore grade in the lower silver grade  along with the higher zinc and lead ore grades discussed above  are due to differences in the sequencing of production from the various mine areas as a part of the overall mine plan 
higher depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in and of million and million  respectively  compared to as a result of the fair market valuation of the acquired share of property  plant  equipment and mineral interests at the acquisition date  additional depreciable assets placed into service  and an increase in units of production depreciation driven by higher production in and mine license taxes that increased in by million compared to and by million compared to the higher taxes are due to the increased profits resulting from the other factors discussed in this section 
the greens creek operation is partially powered by diesel generators  and production costs have historically been significantly affected by fluctuations in fuel prices 
infrastructure has been installed that allows hydroelectric power to be supplied to greens creek by ael p via a submarine cable from north douglas island  near juneau  to admiralty island  where greens creek is located 
this project has reduced production costs at greens creek to the extent power has been available 
during  the mine began receiving an increased proportion of its power needs from ael p 
the increased hydroelectric power utilization continued through part of fuel costs represented approximately of total production costs at greens creek in compared to in and in the decrease in total cash cost per silver ounce in compared to is primarily due to by product credits that increased by per ounce  due to higher zinc  gold  and lead prices and production  partially offset by higher treatment and freight costs  production costs  and production taxes of   and per ounce  respectively 
the higher treatment and freight costs in are due primarily to increased price participation charges by smelters resulting from higher metals prices 
the decrease in total cash cost per silver ounce in compared to is primarily due to production costs and treatment and freight costs that decreased by and per ounce  respectively  and by product credits that increased by per ounce  partially offset by production taxes that increased by per ounce 
while value from zinc  lead and gold by products is significant  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product is appropriate because silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future  we have historically presented greens creek as a producer primarily of silver  based on the original analysis that justified putting the project into production  and believe that consistency in disclosure is important to our investors regardless of the relationships of metals prices and production from year to year  metallurgical treatment maximizes silver recovery  the greens creek deposit is a massive sulfide deposit containing an unusually high proportion of silver  and in most of its working areas  greens creek utilizes selective mining methods in which silver is the metal targeted for highest recovery 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
within our cost per ounce calculations  because we consider zinc  lead and gold to be by products of our silver production  the values of these metals offset operating costs

the decrease in total cash costs per silver ounce in compared to is primarily due to lower production costs and treatment and freight costs by and per ounce  respectively 
the lower costs were partially offset by a decrease in by product credits by per ounce due to lower average lead and zinc prices 
while value from lead and zinc is significant at the lucky friday  we believe that identification of silver as the primary product  with zinc and lead as by products  is appropriate because silver has historically accounted for a higher proportion of revenue than any other metal and is expected to do so in the future  the lucky friday unit is situated in a mining district long associated with silver production  and the lucky friday unit generally utilizes selective mining methods to target silver production 
we periodically review our proven and probable reserves to ensure that reporting of primary products and by products is appropriate 
within our cost per ounce calculations  because we consider zinc and lead to be by products of our silver production  the values of these metals offset operating costs 
over the past years we have evaluated alternatives for deeper access at the lucky friday mine in order to expand its operational life 
as a result  we initiated work on the shaft  an internal shaft at lucky friday  including detailed shaft design  excavation of the hoist room and off shaft development access to shaft facilities  placement and receipt of orders for major equipment purchases  and other construction activities 
upon completion  shaft could allow us to mine mineralized material below our current workings and provide deeper platforms for exploration 
construction of shaft would take approximately four more years to complete  and capital expenditures for the project would total approximately million  including approximately million already committed as of december  our management currently expects to seek final approval of the project by the board of directors in the first half of we believe that our current and anticipated capital resources will allow us to proceed even if the proposed settlement of the basin litigation and related claims is finalized and payments made as anticipated thereunder 
however  there are a number of factors that could affect final approval of the project  including a significant decline in metals prices  a significant increase in operating or capital costs  reductions in cash or financing available  whether arising from decreased cash flow or other uses of available cash  or our inability to successfully settle or otherwise manage our existing and potential environmental liabilities relating to historical mining activities in the coeur d alene basin 
discontinued operations the la camorra unit during the third quarter of  we sold our wholly owned subsidiaries holding our business and operations of the la camorra unit to rusoro mining  ltd 
rusoro for million in cash and  shares of rusoro common stock 
the results of our venezuelan operations have been reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented

this was offset by a decrease in pension benefit costs recognized resulting from an increase in the expected returns calculated for plan assets due to higher plan asset values 
higher provision for closed operations and environmental matters in by million 
the principal cause of the increase was a million increase in our accrual for environmental obligations related to the coeur d alene basin  compared to million in the increase in was pursuant to negotiations with the plaintiffs in the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and the state of idaho on the financial terms of potential settlement of the litigation and related claims 
for further discussion  see note to notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense and debt related fees were million lower in as a result of payoff in of corporate debt  offset partly by increased capital leases in mark to market losses on financially settled forward contracts for forecasted lead and zinc sales totaling million in the program commenced in april  and hence  no such activity was reported in an income tax benefit of million compared to an income tax benefit of million in the income tax benefit is primarily related to deferred tax asset valuation allowance adjustments of million partially offset by current income tax provision and amortization of deferred tax assets

lower interest expense  net of amount capitalized  in by million due to payoff of our bridge facility balance in february and payoff of our term facility balance in october see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on our credit facilities 
higher debt related fees in due to million in expense recognized in the first quarter of for preferred shares issued pursuant to our amended and restated credit agreement and million in professional fees incurred in related to compliance with our amended and restated credit agreement 
see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
an income tax benefit of million in compared to an income tax provision of million in the income tax benefit is primarily related to a million reduction in the valuation allowance for our deferred tax asset balances in the fourth quarter

reconciliation of total cash costs non gaap to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap the tables below present reconciliations between non gaap total cash costs to cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization gaap for our operations at the greens creek and lucky friday units for the years ended december   and in thousands  except costs per ounce 
total cash costs include all direct and indirect operating cash costs related directly to the physical activities of producing metals  including mining  processing and other plant costs  third party refining expense  on site general and administrative costs  royalties and mining production taxes  net of by product revenues earned from all metals other than the primary metal produced at each unit 
total cash costs provide management and investors an indication of net cash flow  after consideration of the realized price received for production sold 
management also uses this measurement for the comparative monitoring of performance of our mining operations period to period from a cash flow perspective 
total cash cost per ounce is a measure developed by precious metals companies in an effort to provide a comparable standard  however  there can be no assurance that our reporting of this non gaap measure is similar to that reported by other mining companies 
cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization  is the most comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with gaap to total cash costs 
the sum of the cost of sales and other direct production costs and depreciation  depletion and amortization for our operating units in the tables below is presented in our consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income loss

in february of  the negotiators representing hecla  the plaintiffs  and the state of idaho with respect to the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims reached an understanding on proposed financial terms to be incorporated into a comprehensive settlement that would contain additional terms yet to be negotiated 
the final terms of settlement  if agreed upon by all parties  would be part of a full and final settlement in the form of a consent decree 
if we reach agreement on the final terms of the settlement  and a consent decree is entered  it would resolve hecla limited s liability related to historical mine workings in the basin including the box 
while full and final settlement of the litigation and other claims has not been reached  and there is no assurance that such a settlement will be reached  the negotiated financial terms would require the following payments million within days after entry of the consent decree 
million in cash or shares of hecla mining company common stock  at our election  within days after entry of the consent decree 
million within days after the first anniversary of entry of the consent decree 
million within days after the second anniversary of entry of the consent decree 
million by august  in the form of quarterly payments of the proceeds from exercises of any outstanding series and series warrants which have an exercise price of between and per share during the quarter with the balance of the million due in august regardless of the amount of warrants that have been exercised 
we have received proceeds of approximately million for the exercise of series and series warrants as of the date of this report  which we anticipate would be paid to the plaintiffs within days after entry of the consent decree 
the foregoing payments of million  million  and million would require third party surety  the form of which remains to be determined 
further  from april  until the lodging of the consent decree  each of the foregoing payments with the exception of the million payment would accrue interest at the prime rate currently 
the million and million payments would also accrue interest from the entry of the consent decree until payment at the superfund rate currently 
in addition to the foregoing payments  we would be obligated to provide the plaintiffs or the state of idaho with a limited amount of land we currently own to be used as a repository waste site 
the interest in the land to be provided was acquired by hecla limited in prior periods  and will require no cash payment 
we entered into a million credit facility in april of for the acquisition of the companies owning of the joint venture operating the greens creek mine 
we fully repaid the facility with a final payment of million from available cash in october we also entered into an amended three year  million senior secured revolving credit facility in october the facility is available for general corporate purposes and  based on our current cash position and business plan  we do not currently anticipate drawing on the facility in the near term 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information on how the covenants in our credit facility may impact our liquidity and capital resources in the future 
we may engage in other transactions  such as additional acquisition opportunities or capital projects  which could require additional equity issuances or financing 
there can be no assurances that such financing will be available to us 
as a result of our current cash balance  the performance of our operations  current metals prices  and full availability of our million revolving credit agreement  we believe our cash  cash equivalents  investments  cash from operations  and availability of financing if needed will be adequate to meet our obligations during the next twelve months 
we currently estimate that a total of approximately million will be incurred on capital expenditures for equipment  infrastructure  and development at our lucky friday and greens creek units in we also estimate that exploration expenditures will total approximately million in to increase production and longevity at the lucky friday mine  we have initiated work on the shaft  including detailed shaft design  excavation of the hoist room and off shaft development access to shaft facilities  placement and receipt of orders for major equipment purchases  and other construction activities 
if we decide to continue with construction of shaft  it would involve capital expenditures of approximately million  which includes approximately million that has been spent on the project as of december  our ability to finance such a project will depend on our operational performance  metals prices  our ability to estimate capital costs  sources of liquidity available to us  and other factors 
we believe that our available cash  revolving credit agreement  cash from operations  and access to equity and financial markets will allow us to proceed even if the proposed settlement of the basin litigation and related claims is finalized and payments made as anticipated thereunder 
we may also mitigate market risk from time to time with selective base metal derivative contract programs 
however  a sustained downturn in metals prices or significant increases in operational or capital costs or other factors beyond our control could compel us to suspend the project in the future 
hecla limited  our wholly owned subsidiary  has been involved in settlement negotiations with the us government  the coeur d alene indian tribe  and the state of idaho regarding our existing and potential liability relating to historical mining activity in the coeur d alene basin see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
on january   all of the outstanding shares of our mandatory convertible preferred stock were converted to shares of our common stock  and we paid the final quarterly dividend on that series of preferred stock in january see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
we are no longer required to pay quarterly dividends of approximately million as a result of the conversion 
year ended december  cash provided by operating activities in millions cash provided by operating activities increased by million in compared to due to higher income  as adjusted for non cash items 
the improved results are primarily due to higher prices for all four metals produced at our operations 
working capital and other asset and liability changes increased cash flow by million in  compared to a million decrease in the million difference is due to an increase in accounts payable and accrued liability and accrued taxes balances and lower trade accounts receivable  other current and noncurrent asset  and inventory balances  partially offset by lower payroll related accruals and higher cash reductions to accrued reclamation and closure costs 
the increase in accounts payable is due to increased activity at our operating units and the accrual of dividends in the fourth quarter of on our mandatory convertible preferred stock  which were paid in cash in january we recorded increased accruals for income and production taxes as a result of higher profitability at our operations 
the smaller increase in accounts receivable and decrease in inventory balances is due to the timing of concentrate shipments at our greens creek unit 
other current and noncurrent asset balances decreased due to the timing of payment of prepaid expenditures 
the lower accrued payroll and related benefits balance is due mainly to the payment of incentive compensation in the first quarter of the cash decrease in our reclamation accruals is due to the payment of million related to past response costs at the bunker hill superfund site  and increased reclamation work performed at our grouse creek site in the higher cash provided by operating activities in compared to is primarily due to net income from continuing operations  adjusted for non cash elements  which increased by million due to improved prices and production  lower interest expense  and lower exploration expense 
working capital changes reduced cash flow in  primarily as a result of a million increase in the change in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable is due to an increase in the quantity of concentrate shipped that was pending final settlement at year end versus and an increase in metals prices in  resulting in higher values per ton of concentrate 
in addition  a adjustment to product inventory related to the purchase price allocation for greens creek did not have a counterpart in million in net cash used by discontinued operations in had no comparable event in  as we sold our discontinued venezuelan operations in the third quarter of year ended december  cash used in investing activities in millions we spent million on capital expenditures in  including million at lucky friday and million at greens creek  which  in the aggregate  was million higher than total capital expenditures of million in  which included million spent for projects at lucky friday and million for greens creek 
the increase capital spending was due  in part  to the deferral of projects in we received million in proceeds from the sale of the velarde a mill in mexico in the first quarter of see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information on the sale 
our restricted cash balances for environmental bonds were reduced by million in versus million in sales of investments yielded million versus million in cash outlay for capital expenditures totaled million in  a million decrease compared to the reduced level of capital spending in was the result of cost reduction efforts in response to the impact of the global economic crisis 
in addition  during we invested million for the acquisition of the remaining interest in greens creek joint venture  and received million from rusoro for its acquisition of our venezuelan operations 
sales of investments yielded million in proceeds in  and we reduced our restricted cash and investment balances by million in by lowering our collateral requirements 
short term investment maturities yielded million in year ended december  cash provided by used in financing activities in millions cash provided by financing activities for included million  net of tax benefits  in proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information  while we paid cash dividends of million on our preferred stock and made repayments on our capital leases of million 
in addition  we acquired treasury shares of our common stock having a value of million in as a result of cashless employee stock option exercises 
our financing activities in included sales of common stock and warrants  which yielded million cash  net of related issuance costs 
net proceeds from the stock and warrant sales were applied to repayments of our debt facility totaling million and payments totaling million pursuant to our interest rate swap 
we declared cash dividends of million and million on our mandatory convertible and series b preferred stock in the fourth quarter of  which were paid in january this represented the last dividend on our mandatory convertible preferred stock  which converted to shares of our common stock in january in  we borrowed million on our debt facility for the acquisition of the remaining of the greens creek joint venture  of which we repaid million in largely from common stock sales totaling million 
we also incurred loan origination fees in of million versus million in  and paid cash dividends totaling million in contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments the table below presents our fixed  non cancelable contractual obligations and commitments primarily related to our outstanding purchase orders  certain capital expenditures  our credit facility as modified by amendments  and lease arrangements as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year years years after years total purchase obligations commitment fees contractual obligations capital lease commitments operating lease commitments supplemental executive retirement plan total contractual cash obligations consist of open purchase orders of approximately million at the greens creek unit and million at the lucky friday unit 
included in these amounts are approximately million and million related to various capital projects at the greens creek and lucky friday units  respectively 
in october we entered into a million revolving credit agreement  which was amended in march  july  and december we are required to pay a standby fee  dependent on our leverage ratio  of between and per annum on undrawn amounts under the revolving credit agreement 
there was no amount drawn under the revolving credit agreement as of december   and the amounts above assume no amounts will be drawn during the agreement s term 
for more information on our credit facility  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we were committed to approximately million for various capital projects at the greens creek and lucky friday units 
total contractual obligations at december  also include approximately  for commitments relating to non capital items at greens creek 
represents scheduled capital lease payments of million and million including interest  respectively  for equipment at our greens creek and lucky friday units 
these leases have fixed payment terms and contain bargain purchase options at the end of the lease periods 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease or purchase the leased property 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease arrangements 
there are no funding requirements as of december  under our other defined benefit pension plans 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more information 
we record a liability for costs associated with mine closure  reclamation of land and other environmental matters 
at december   our liability for these matters totaled million  including for hecla limited s liability relating to the coeur d alene basin in northern idaho  for which no contractual or commitment obligations exist 
however  in february of  the negotiators representing hecla  the plaintiffs  and the state of idaho with respect to the coeur d alene basin environmental litigation and related claims reached an understanding on proposed financial terms to be incorporated into a comprehensive settlement that would contain additional terms yet to be negotiated 
while full and final settlement of the litigation and other claims has not been reached  and there is no assurance that such a settlement will be reached  we believe we will be obligated to make significant cash payments to the plaintiffs 
see the financial liquidity and capital resources section above for more information on the financial terms of the proposed settlement 
future expenditures related to closure  reclamation and environmental expenditures at our other sites are difficult to estimate  although we anticipate we will make substantial expenditures relating to these obligations over the next years 
for additional information relating to our environmental obligations  see notes  and of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec regulations  that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors 
critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as described in note  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
our estimates are based on our experience and our interpretation of economic  political  regulatory  and other factors that affect our business prospects 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are related to future metals prices  obligations for environmental  reclamation  and closure matters  mineral reserves  and accounting for business combinations  as they require us to make assumptions that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates were made and changes in them are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
in addition  there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed to be critical 
however  changes in estimates used in these and other items could have a material impact on our financial statements 
future metals prices metals prices are key components in estimates that determine the valuation of some of our significant assets and liabilities  including properties  plants and equipment  deferred tax assets  and certain accounts receivable 
as shown under item a 
risk factors  metals prices have historically been volatile 
while average prices for all four metals we produce performed favorably for the five consecutive years prior to  there was a reduction in the average prices for zinc and lead in compared to  and average prices for silver  zinc and lead were lower in compared to average prices for all four metals rebounded in and were higher than their levels in both and however  we have recorded impairments to our asset carrying value because of low prices in the past  and we can offer no assurance that prices will either remain at their current levels or increase 
future metals prices may also affect the analysis of our ability to pay for environmental remediation or damage settlements 
processes supporting valuation of our assets and liabilities that are most significantly affected by prices include analyses of asset carrying values  depreciation  and deferred income taxes 
on at least an annual basis and more frequently if circumstances warrant we examine the carrying values of our assets  our depreciation rates  and the valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets 
in our analyses of carrying values and deferred taxes  we apply several pricing views to our forecasting model  including current prices  analyst price estimates  forward curve prices  and historical prices see mineral reserves  below  regarding prices used for reserve estimates 
using applicable accounting guidance and our view of metals markets  we use the average of the various methods to determine whether the values of our assets are fairly stated  and to determine the level of valuation allowances  if any  on our deferred tax assets 
in addition  estimates of future metals prices are used in the valuation of certain assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for our acquisitions see business combinations below 
sales of all metals products sold directly to smelters are recorded as revenues when title and risk of loss transfer to the smelter generally at the time of shipment at estimated forward metals prices for the estimated month of settlement 
due to the time elapsed from shipment to the smelter to the final settlement with the smelter  we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled 
previously recorded sales and trade accounts receivable are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices until final settlement by the smelter 
changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement result in changes to revenues and accounts receivable previously recorded upon shipment 
as a result  our trade accounts receivable balances are subject to changes in metals prices until final settlement occurs 
for more information  see part o 
revenue recognition of note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we utilize financially settled forward contracts to manage our exposure to changes in prices for zinc and lead 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk management below for more information on our contract programs 
these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are therefore marked to market though earnings each period 
changes in zinc and lead prices between the dates that the contracts are entered into and their settlements will result in changes to the fair value asset or liability associated with the contracts  with a corresponding gain or loss recognized in earnings 
obligations for environmental  reclamation and closure matters the most significant liability on our balance sheet is for accrued reclamation and closure costs 
we have conducted considerable remediation work at sites in the united states for which remediation requirements have not been fully determined  nor have they been agreed between us and various regulatory agencies with oversight over the properties 
we have estimated our liabilities under appropriate accounting guidance 
on at least an annual basis and more frequently if warranted management reviews our liabilities with our audit committee 
however  the range of liability proposed by the plaintiffs in environmental proceedings considerably exceeds the liabilities we have recognized 
if substantial damages were awarded  claims were settled  or remediation costs incurred in excess of our accruals  our financial results or condition could be materially adversely affected 
mineral reserves critical estimates are inherent in the process of determining our reserves 
our reserves are affected largely by our assessment of future metals prices  as well as by engineering and geological estimates of ore grade  accessibility and production cost 
metals prices are estimated at long term averages  as described in item property descriptions 
our assessment of reserves occurs at least annually  and periodically utilizes external audits 
reserves are a key component in valuation of our properties  plants and equipment 
reserve estimates are used in determining appropriate rates of units of production depreciation  with net book value of many assets depreciated over remaining estimated reserves 
reserves are also a key component in forecasts  with which we compare future cash flows to current asset values to ensure that carrying values are reported appropriately 
reserves also play a key role in the valuation of certain assets in the determination of the purchase price allocations for acquisitions see business combinations below 
reserves are a culmination of many estimates and are not guarantees that we will recover the indicated quantities of metals 
business combinations we are required to allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at acquisition date 
the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived assets  including estimates of future metals prices and mineral reserves  as discussed above 
in some cases  we use third party appraisers to determine the fair values and lives of property and other identifiable assets 
new accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asu  which amends subtopic to require new disclosures on fair value measurements as follows the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers in and out of levels and separate information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in level fair value measurements 
asu also provides amendments to subtopic that clarifies existing fair value measurement disclosures as follows a reporting entity should provide fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities 
a class is often a subset of assets or liabilities within a line item in the statement of financial position 
a reporting entity should provide disclosures about the valuation techniques and inputs used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring fair value measurements 
those disclosures are required for fair value measurements that fall in either level or level asu also includes conforming amendments to the guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets subtopic  changes the terminology in subtopic from major categories of assets to classes of assets  and provides a cross reference to the guidance in subtopic on how to determine appropriate classes to present fair value disclosures 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures discussed above are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
adoption of this guidance has not  and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
during february  the fasb issued asu  which corrected existing guidance for various topics 
the update became generally effective for the first reporting period including interim periods beginning after issuance 
these conditions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements the foregoing discussion and analysis  as well as certain information contained elsewhere in this form k  contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended  and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and are intended to be covered by the safe harbor created thereby 
see the discussion in special note on forward looking statements included prior to part i  item item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainties  as well as summarizes the financial instruments held by us at december   which are sensitive to changes in interest rates and commodity prices and are not held for trading purposes 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either non financial or non quantifiable see part i  item a 
risk factors 
short term investments from time to time we hold various types of short term investments that are subject to changes in market interest rates and are sensitive to those changes 
we did not carry any such short term investments as of december  commodity price risk management at times  we may use commodity forward sales commitments  commodity swap contracts and commodity put and call option contracts to manage our exposure to fluctuation in the prices of certain metals which we produce 
contract positions are designed to ensure that we will receive a defined minimum price for certain quantities of our production  thereby partially offsetting our exposure to price fluctuations 
these instruments do  however  expose us to other risks  including the amount by which the contract price differs from the spot price of a commodity  and nonperformance by the counterparties to these agreements 
in april  we began utilizing financially settled forward contracts to sell lead and zinc at fixed prices for settlement at approximately the same time that our unsettled concentrate sales contracts will settle 
the settlement of each concentrate contract is based on the average spot price of the metal during the month of settlement  which may differ from the prices used to record the sale when the sale takes place 
the objective of the contracts is to manage the exposure to changes in prices of zinc and lead contained in our concentrate shipments between the time of sale and final settlement 
these contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings each period 
at december   we recorded a current liability of million  which is included in current derivative contract liabilities  for the fair value of the contracts 
we recognized a million net loss on the contracts during  which is included in sales of products 
the net loss recognized on the contracts offset price adjustments on our provisional concentrate sales related to changes to lead and zinc prices between the time of sale and final settlement 
in addition  in may we began utilizing financially settled forward contracts to manage the exposure of changes in prices of zinc and lead contained in our forecasted future concentrate shipments 
these contracts also do not qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market through earnings each period 
at december   we recorded a current liability of million  which is included in current derivative contract liabilities  and a non current liability of million  which is included in other non current liabilities  for the fair value of the contracts 
we recognized a million net loss on the contracts  including million in losses realized on settled contracts  during the net loss on these contracts is included as a separate line item under other income expense  as they relate to forecasted future shipments  as opposed to sales that have already taken place but are subject to final pricing 
the losses recognized during the are the result of increasing lead and zinc prices during the end of however  this program is designed to mitigate the impact of potential future declines in lead and zinc prices from the price levels established in the contracts see average price information below 
the following table summarizes the quantities of base metals committed under forward sales contracts at december  metric tonnes under contract average price per pound zinc lead zinc lead contracts on provisional sales settlements contracts on forecasted sales settlements settlements interest rate risk management historically we have periodically used derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
in may  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement that had the economic effect of modifying the libor based variable interest obligations associated with the previous version of our credit facility 
as a result  the interest payable related to the term facility balance was to be fixed at a rate of until the scheduled maturity on september  pursuant to the amended and restated credit facility 
hedge accounting was applied for this swap and the terms of the interest rate swap agreement including notational amounts  interest rate reset dates  and maturity dates matched the terms of the hedged note to which the swap agreement pertained 
at inception and on an ongoing basis  we performed an effectiveness test using the hypothetical derivative method  and the swap was determined to be highly effective at offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged note 
the interest rate swap was designated as a cash flow hedge  and the fair value of the swap was calculated using the discounted cash flow method based on market observable inputs 
in october we repaid the remaining facility balance and settled the remaining fair value liability associated with the swap 
in october we entered into an amended million revolving credit agreement for a three year term  which was amended in march  july  and again in december see note of notes to condensed consolidated financial statements unaudited for more information 
we have not drawn on the current revolving credit facility 
however  if used  amounts borrowed under the facility would be subject to changes in market interest rates 
provisional sales sales of all metals products sold directly to smelters  including by product metals  are recorded as revenues when title and risk of loss transfers to the smelter generally at the time of shipment at forward prices for the estimated month of settlement 
due to the time elapsed from shipment to the smelter and the final settlement with the smelter  we must estimate the prices at which sales of our metals will be settled 
previously recorded sales are adjusted to estimated settlement metals prices until final settlement by the smelter 
changes in metals prices between shipment and final settlement will result in changes to revenues previously recorded upon shipment 
metals prices can and often do fluctuate widely and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control see item a risk factors a substantial or extended decline in metals prices would have a material adverse effect on us for more information 
at december   metals contained in concentrates and exposed to future price changes totaled approximately million ounces of silver   ounces of gold   tons of zinc  and  tons of lead 
if the price for each metal were to change by one percent  the change in the total value of the concentrates sold would be approximately million 
however  as noted in commodity price risk management above  in april we initiated a program designed to mitigate the risk of negative price adjustments with limited mark to market financially settled forward contracts for our zinc and lead sales
