industry background malocclusion malocclusion  or the misalignment of teeth  is one of the most prevalent clinical dental conditions  affecting approximately to of the population of major developed countries or nearly a billion individuals 
approximately million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide  of which approximately million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign our served 
table of contents market 
while most individuals seek orthodontic treatment to improve their appearance  malocclusion may also be responsible for dental problems such as tooth decay  tooth loss  gum disease  jaw joint pain and headaches 
because of the compromised aesthetics  discomfort and other drawbacks associated with traditional orthodontic treatments  only a relatively small proportion of people with malocclusion seek treatment 
traditional orthodontic treatment in the us  dental professionals treat malocclusion primarily with metal arch wires and brackets  commonly referred to as braces 
occasionally  dental professionals attempt to improve treatment aesthetics by using ceramic  tooth colored brackets or bond brackets on the inside  or lingual surfaces  of the patient s teeth 
dental professionals also augment braces with elastics  metal bands  headgear and other ancillary devices 
the average treatment takes approximately to months to complete and requires several hours of direct dental professional involvement  or chair time 
to initiate treatment  a dental professional will diagnose a patient s condition and create an appropriate treatment plan 
in a subsequent visit  the dental professional will bond brackets to the patient s teeth with a bonding agent and attach an arch wire to the brackets 
thereafter  by tightening or otherwise adjusting the braces approximately every six weeks  the dental professional is able to exert sufficient force on the patient s teeth to achieve desired tooth movement 
in a final visit  the dental professional removes each bracket and residual bonding agent from the patient s teeth 
upon completion of the treatment  the dental professional may  at his or her discretion  have the patient use a retainer 
fees for traditional orthodontic treatment in the us typically range between  to  with a median fee of approximately  generally only a portion of the fee is reimbursed by insurance 
fees are based on the difficulty of the particular case and on the dental professional s estimate of chair time  and are generally negotiated in advance 
a treatment that exceeds the dental professional s estimate of chair time generally results in decreased fees per hour of chair time  and reduced profitability for the dental professional 
limitations of traditional orthodontic treatment although braces are generally effective in correcting a wide range of malocclusions  they are subject to many limitations and disadvantages 
traditional orthodontic treatment is associated with unattractive appearance 
braces call attention to the patient s condition and treatment 
in addition  braces trap food  which can further compromise appearance 
braces can also result in permanent discoloration of teeth 
as a result of these and other limitations  relatively few adults with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment and braces can compromise the self esteem of young adults and teenagers 
oral discomfort 
braces are sharp and bulky and can abrade and irritate the interior surfaces of the mouth 
the tightening or adjustment of braces results in root and gum soreness and discomfort  especially in the few days immediately following an orthodontic visit 
poor oral hygiene 
braces can make it difficult to brush and floss leaving teeth vulnerable to developing decay  plaque  periodontal disease and stains that must be taken care of after braces are removed 
additionally  the bonding of brackets to teeth can cause permanent markings on the teeth 
inability to project treatment 
historically  dental professionals have not had a means to model the movement of teeth over a course of treatment 
accordingly  dental professionals must rely on intuition and judgment to plan and project treatment 
as a result  they cannot be precise about the direction or distance of expected tooth movement between patient visits 
this lack of predictability may result in unwanted tooth movements and can limit the dental professional s ability to estimate the duration of treatment 
because most orthodontic treatment is performed on a fixed price basis  extended treatment duration reduces profitability for the dental professional 

table of contents physical demands on dental professional 
the manipulation of wires and brackets requires sustained manual dexterity and visual acuity  and may place other physical burdens on the dental professional 
root resorption 
the sustained high levels of force associated with traditional treatment can result in root resorption  which is a shortening of tooth roots 
this shortening can have substantial adverse periodontal consequences for the patient 
emergencies 
at times  brackets and wires need to be repaired or replaced on an emergency basis 
such emergencies cause significant inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional 
due to the poor aesthetics  discomfort and other limitations of braces  relatively few adults with malocclusion elect traditional orthodontic treatment 
additionally  teenagers that seek orthodontic treatment have traditionally only had the option of braces for treatment 
accordingly  we believe there is a large unmet need for an alternative orthodontic treatment that addresses these patient concerns 
the invisalign solution invisalign is a proprietary system for treating malocclusion based on a series of doctor prescribed  custom manufactured  clear plastic removable orthodontic appliances aligners 
the invisalign system offers a range of treatment options  specialized services  and proprietary software for treatment visualization 
comprised of several phases  the principal steps of the invisalign system are the creation of customized digital treatment plans using proprietary software known as clincheck software  which occurs in our facility in san jose  costa rica  and the manufacturing of customized invisalign aligners  which occurs in our facility in juarez  mexico 
orthodontic diagnosis and transmission of treatment data to us 
in an initial patient visit  the dental professional determines whether invisalign is an appropriate treatment 
the dental professional then prepares a treatment data package which consists of prescription form  a polyvinyl siloxane  or pvs impression of the relevant dental arches  photographs of the patient and  at the dental professional s election  x rays of the patient s dentition 
the impression is a critical component of the invisalign system as it depicts the three dimensional geometry of the patient s teeth and hence forms the basis for our computer models and subsequent molds and aligners 
an impression requires the patient to bite into a viscous material 
this material hardens  capturing the shape of the patient s teeth 
the prescription is also a critical component of the invisalign system  describing the desired positions and movement of the patient s teeth 
the dental professional sends the treatment data to our facility in juarez  mexico 
preparation of three dimensional computer models of the patient s initial malocclusion 
upon receipt  we use the treatment data to construct digital models of the patient s dentition 
using computed tomography  known as ct scanning  we scan the pvs impression to develop a digital  three dimensional computer model of the patient s current dentition 
we then transmit this initial computer model together with the dental professional s prescription and supplemental materials electronically to our facility in san jose  costa rica 
preparation of computer simulated treatment and viewing of treatment using clincheck software 
in costa rica  we transform this initial digital model into a proposed custom  three dimensional treatment plan that simulates appropriate tooth movement in a series of two week increments 
this simulated treatment plan  called a clincheck treatment plan  is based on an internally developed and proprietary computer modeling program that allows dental professionals to diagnose and plan treatments for their patients 
this clincheck treatment plan is then reviewed for adherence to prescribed clinical treatment and quality standards 
upon completion of the review  the patient s clincheck treatment plan is then made available to the prescribing dental professional via the invisalign doctor site formally known as the virtual invisalign practice or vip  our proprietary customer interfacing software portal  which is available on our websites located at www 
invisalign 
com and www 
aligntechinstitute 
com 
the dental professional then reviews the clincheck treatment plan and can either accept the proposed treatment or request modifications and adjustments until satisfied with the treatment 
table of contents plan 
the clincheck animation allows the dental professional to view this three dimensional simulation with a high degree of magnification and from any angle 
accordingly  the clincheck treatment plan enables the dental professional to project tooth movement with a level of accuracy not previously possible with metal arch wires and brackets 
by reviewing and amending the treatment simulation  the dental professional retains control over the treatment plan and  thus participates in the customized design of the aligners 
at this point  the dental professional may also invite the patient to view the treatment plan  allowing the patient to see the projected course of treatment 
the dental professional s final approval of the proposed clincheck treatment plan engages us to manufacture the corresponding molds and aligners in juarez  mexico 
construction of molds corresponding to each step of treatment 
upon the dental professional s approval of the clincheck treatment plan  we use the data underlying the simulation  in conjunction with stereolithography technology  to construct a series of molds depicting the future position of the patient s teeth 
each mold is a replica of the patient s teeth at each two week stage of the simulated course of treatment 
these molds are then used to fabricate the patient s aligners 
manufacture of aligners and shipment to the dental professional 
from these molds  aligners are fabricated by pressure forming polymeric sheets over each mold 
aligners are thin  clear plastic  removable dental appliances that are custom manufactured in a series to correspond to each two week stage of the clincheck animation 
aligners are customized to perform the treatment prescribed by dental professionals for an individual patient by using a clincheck treatment plan 
each aligner covers a patient s teeth and is nearly invisible when worn 
aligners are commonly worn in pairs  over the upper and lower dental arches 
aligners are generally worn for consecutive two week periods which correspond to the approved clincheck treatment plan 
after two weeks of use  the patient replaces them with the next pair in the series  advancing the teeth movement with each aligner stage 
this process is repeated until the final aligners are used and treatment is complete 
when treating with invisalign full  invisalign express and invisalign teen  aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment 
for invisalign assist  when the progress tracking feature is selected  aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages 
in certain cases  dental professionals may use invisalign in conjunction with tooth colored attachments bonded to the patient s teeth 
these attachments are used to increase the force applied to a tooth or teeth in circumstances where the aligners alone may have difficulty in effecting the desired movement 
we provide an aligner like template to the dental professionals to aid the placement of bonding attachments to the patient s teeth where needed 
also  in cases where interproximal reduction  or ipr  is required or requested by the dental professional  we provide an ipr treatment form  quantifying the amount of space to be created through enamel reduction  location  and timing of ipr 
retention 
upon completion of the treatment  the patient may be prescribed our single clear retainer product or our vivera retainer product 
vivera retainers are shipped every three months over the one year period 
our products our revenues are generated from the sale of the following product offerings 
percentage of revenues by product fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year invisalign full invisalign express lite invisalign teen invisalign assist non case total 
table of contents invisalign g in october of  we launched invisalign g  the most significant collection of new features and innovation in our company s history touching virtually every system and product 
significant improvements and enhancements were made to all our customer facing systems 
for instance  the invisalign doctor site now consolidates all of a patient s invisalign records and treatment tasks together in one location for easy access and the clincheck software now includes drag and drop features  additional clinical tools and a more intuitive interface 
in addition  with the exception of our vivera retainers  we introduced new and expanded features across our product line 
engineered to deliver even better clinical results  the new invisalign g aligner and software features make it easier to use invisalign with patients who have class ii and class iii malocclusion 
the new features include precision cuts which are custom mesial and distal hooks to provide anchorage for elastics and button cutouts to accommodate buttons bonded to the tooth aimed to help treat patients with class ii and class iii malocclusion  and new smartforce features engineered to achieve more predictable tooth movements using custom optimized attachments and power ridges 
invisalign g is currently available in north america and will be launched internationally in the second quarter of invisalign full 
invisalign full is intended to be used as a complete treatment for a broad range of malocclusions 
each treatment plan is unique to the individual patient and will consist of as many aligners as indicated by clincheck treatment plan in order to achieve the doctor s treatment goals 
for invisalign full  aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment 
invisalign express and invisalign lite 
invisalign express and invisalign lite are lower cost solutions for less complex orthodontic cases that meet certain predetermined clinical criteria and includes non comprehensive treatment relapse cases  for minor crowding and spacing  or as a pre cursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers 
invisalign express uses up to sets of aligners and is sold in the us and canada 
invisalign lite uses up to sets of aligners and is sold to our international regions 
for invisalign express lite  aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment 
invisalign teen 
invisalign teen is designed to meet the specific needs of the non adult comprehensive or teen treatment market 
invisalign teen includes features such as compliance indicators to help gauge patient wear and compliance and specially engineered aligner features to address the natural eruption of key teeth common in teen patients 
predominantly marketed to orthodontists who treat the vast majority of malocclusion in teen patients  these features are intended to meet the treatment needs of those younger patients 
as part of invisalign teen  we include up to six free individual replacement aligners during active treatment to cover potential aligner loss 
for invisalign teen  aligners other than the replacement aligners are manufactured and then delivered to the dental professionals in a single shipment 
invisalign assist 
invisalign assist is designed specifically for gps who want more support in selecting  monitoring and finishing invisalign cases 
intended to help newly trained and lower volume gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice  invisalign assist is intended to make it easier for gps to select appropriate cases for their experience level or treatment approach  submit cases more efficiently and manage appointments with suggested tasks 
in addition  progress tracking features allow gps to submit new impressions every nine stages 
when the progress tracking feature is selected  aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages 
retention 
in addition to our traditional single retainer product  we offer vivera retainers  where we deliver a new replacement retainer to orthodontic patients every three months for one year 
vivera retainers are produced using the same proprietary technology and material as the invisalign aligners  and offer an effective  aesthetic retention solution for both invisalign and non invisalign patients 

table of contents training  ancillary and other 
the remaining net revenues are generated by training fees and sales of ancillary products  such as cleaning material and adjusting tools used by dental professionals during the course of treatment 
proprietary software mentioned in this annual report on form k such as clincheck software and the invisalign doctor site are included as part of the invisalign system and are not sold separately nor do they contribute as individual items of revenue 
benefits of invisalign we believe that invisalign provides benefits to dental professionals and patients that have the potential to establish invisalign as the preferred alternative to traditional braces 
benefits to the dental professional ability to visualize the treatment plan and treatment options 
the clincheck software enables dental professionals to preview and modify the intended outcome of treatment in an interactive three dimensional computer model 
the clincheck treatment plan allows dental professionals to analyze multiple treatment alternatives before selecting the course of action they feel is most appropriate for the patient 
expanded patient base 
we believe that invisalign has the potential to transform the practice of orthodontics 
currently  approximately million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide  of which approximately million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign our served market 
as of december   our share of the million patients in our served market is approximately 
our market research indicates that the vast majority of adults with malocclusion who desire treatment do not elect traditional treatment because of its many limitations 
we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces  adults  who are particularly sensitive to aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment  will be more likely to seek treatment 
we therefore believe that invisalign will allow dental professionals to attract patients who would not otherwise seek orthodontic treatment 
in addition  as the primary care provider  gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to introduce invisalign and expand their practice and patient base 
practice productivity 
we believe that as dental professionals move to a higher volume of invisalign patients  they will be able to better leverage their existing resources  including staff time and office space resulting in an increase in daily patient appointments and practice productivity 
benefits to the patient excellent aesthetics 
aligners are nearly invisible when worn  significantly reducing the aesthetic concerns associated with traditional braces 
comfort 
by replacing the six week adjustment cycle of traditional braces with two week stages  aligners move teeth more gently 
also  aligners are thin  smooth and low in profile 
as a result  aligners are more comfortable and less irritating than traditional braces 
improved oral hygiene 
patients can remove aligners for tasks that are difficult with traditional braces  such as eating  brushing and flossing 
we believe this feature has the potential to reduce enamel decalcification  tooth decay  and periodontal damage during treatment  which may result from traditional fixed braces 
potentially reduced root resorption 
aligners control force by distributing it broadly over the exposed surfaces of the teeth 
we believe that controlling force has the potential to reduce the incidence of root resorption  which is the breakdown or destruction of root structure that can occur during orthodontic treatment 

table of contents reduced incidence of emergencies 
typically  a lost or broken aligner is simply replaced with the next aligner in the treatment series  minimizing inconvenience to both the patient and the dental professional 
we believe that these benefits will prove attractive to people who currently do not seek treatment because of the limitations of traditional braces or as an alternative  more aesthetic treatment option for teenagers 
limitations of invisalign in some instances  the invisalign system may have certain limitations relative to traditional treatment 
aligners cost more to produce than traditional braces  and we charge dental professionals more than they generally pay for the supplies used in traditional treatment 
depending on the individual pricing policies of each dental professional and the treatment selected  the cost of invisalign treatment to the patient may be greater than for traditional braces 
dental professionals must also incorporate our manufacturing cycle times into their overall treatment plan 
once a dental professional submits a case to us  there are a variety of factors that may impact when the corresponding aligners are delivered  one of which includes the timing of when the dental professional accepts the case 
aligners may not be appropriate for all cases  such as severe malocclusion  which may require aligners to be used in combination with traditional braces for optimal results 
in addition  because aligners are removable  treatment using invisalign depends on patients wearing their aligners as recommended 
some patients may experience a temporary period of adjustment to wearing aligners that may mildly affect speech 
in some instances  patients have experienced scratched or irritated gums  cheeks and lips and in some rare instances  allergic reactions have been reported 
we believe that these limitations are generally outweighed by the many benefits of invisalign to both patients and dental professionals 
our target market and patient base our market research indicates that the majority of adults with malocclusion who desire treatment forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many limitations 
we believe that since invisalign addresses the primary limitations of braces  adults  who are particularly sensitive to aesthetic limitations of traditional treatment  will be more likely to seek treatment and therefore represent our most immediate market expansion opportunity 
with the launch of invisalign teen in july  we now offer a product designed to meet the needs of the non adult comprehensive  or younger teen  treatment market 
invisalign teen makes our treatment more applicable to an orthodontist s patient base  which we believe will provide us the opportunity to increase our penetration into and our share of the teen treatment market 
in addition  many parents also elect traditional treatment for their children due to limited awareness of invisalign applicability for teenager use 
our goals are to extend our leadership in clear aligner therapy with adults  increase awareness and consumer demand with moms and teens  and to continue expansion of the clear aligner category overall 
by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers adults  parents and teens we intend to increase the number of patients who seek treatment using invisalign 
approximately million people annually elect treatment by orthodontists worldwide of which approximately million have mild to moderate malocclusion and are applicable to invisalign our served market 
twenty five percent of these patients  or approximately thousand have mature dentition adults and older teens  with fully erupted second molars and substantially completed jaw growth 
seventy five percent  or approximately million  have erupting dentition non adult comprehensive  or younger teens  with partially erupted second molars  cuspid and second bicuspid teeth 
as of december   our share of the million patients in our served market is approximately 
published market data for gps providing treatment for malocclusion is limited  however  as the primary care provider  gps have access to a greater number of patients than orthodontists and possess a unique opportunity to introduce invisalign and expand their practice and patient base 
we believe gps represent a significant market expansion opportunity 

table of contents as of december   approximately million patients cumulatively worldwide have started treatment using invisalign 
the invisalign system is sold in north america  europe  asia pacific  latin america and japan 
international sales accounted for approximately   and of our net revenues in   and  respectively 
a geographic breakdown of our net revenues is summarized in note segments and geographical information in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we operate as one reportable segment the design  development  manufacturing and marketing of invisalign 
additionally  no single customer accounted for or more of our total net revenues in   and business strategy our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals by focusing on the following key strategic initiatives continue to accelerate product and clinical innovation  including new products with significant evolution in features and functionality  in order to extend clinical applicability and enhance effectiveness  treat more patients and achieve better outcomes  enhance the customer experience for our doctors and for their staff through evolution in customer facing systems and programs making it easier and more efficient to adopt invisalign into their practice and increase utilization  increase the effectiveness of consumer demand creation and extend invisalign brand awareness  and continue to drive international growth  principally in europe  while opening up additional new markets around the world  such as china 
product innovation and clinical effectiveness 
we believe that product performance and innovation is a cornerstone to our future long term goal to drive and sustain invisalign adoption 
our primary channels gps and orthodontists each have distinct and separate needs 
specifically  orthodontists want a more robust set of tools for greater predictability  wider applicability across their patient base and more flexibility in the use of the invisalign system 
on the other hand  typical gps want greater ease of use  more efficient and simplified diagnostic tools  guidance through the case set up process  minimal treatment intervention and self help tools designed to simplify treatment of cases of mild to moderate malocclusion 
the invisalign system offers a variety of treatment options and products to address both channel needs 
for example  invisalign teen is predominately marketed to the orthodontist whose patient base largely consists of teen aged patients 
invisalign teen has grown from of our total case volume when it was introduced in to of our total case volume in we expect that orthodontists will continue to adopt invisalign teen steadily  after they experience multiple successful treatment outcomes 
invisalign assist launched in  is intended to help newly trained and lower volume invisalign gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice 
most recently in october of  we launched invisalign g  the most significant collection of new features and innovation in our company history touching virtually every system and product 
significant improvements and enhancements were made to both our customer facing systems invisalign doctor site and clincheck software and product features across our entire product line except for retainers 
on january   we announced an agreement to jointly develop software applications that will run on cadent itero and ioc scanners for use in invisalign treatment 
cadent inc cadent is a manufacturer of d digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry 
the agreement embodies our commitment to innovation and our desire to improve the overall customer experience for invisalign providers 
the new applications will optimize case assessment and planning for invisalign treatment  and bring valuable digital tools chair side for invisalign providers who use cadent scanners 
a series of applications will be developed over the next couple of years  and we expect the first application to be available by the end of before we can bring these new applications to market  we need to ensure interoperability with cadent scanners for use in invisalign treatment 
we have established very robust standards for scan quality and accuracy to ensure a specific scanning technology can successfully replace pvs impressions for invisalign treatment 
we are now in final beta tests to validate the cadent systems  and expect to announce interoperability with cadent scanners in the second quarter of 
table of contents we believe continuing to introduce new products and product features will keep us at the forefront of the market and increase adoption and frequency of use what we call utilization or same practice sales of invisalign  however  we expect that adoption of these new products will increase gradually over a number of years 
during  we plan to continue our efforts to demonstrate clinical efficacy and work towards a long term goal of becoming the orthodontic treatment of choice 
enhancing the customer experience and increasing adoption 
we are committed to enhancing the customer experience through the evolution of our customer facing systems and programs making it easier and more efficient for our customers to adopt invisalign into their practice and increase utilization 
specifically  we provide robust clinical education resources and training programs  clinical and field sales customer support  assistance with practice development  and incentive programs to encourage our customers integrate invisalign into their practice 
clinical education and training 
ensuring that trained doctors are confident in using the invisalign system is a key driver toward our ultimate goal of increasing product adoption 
we continuously update our training programs to address the needs of our customers 
for instance  we developed ask the expert webinars  a series of interactive web phone conferences led by experienced invisalign providers to educate our customers about new products or features or to discuss relevant clinical topics 
in addition  we focus on invisalign assist as part of our initial training program  clear essentials i  since we believe invisalign assist is the right product for newly trained gps 
we anticipate that by using invisalign assist  newly trained gps will exit this initial training program with increased confidence in prescribing invisalign treatment 
our new doctor training in north america is evolving to identify and focus on practices that are interested in gaining the skills and experience necessary to be successful with invisalign 
we have also incorporated the invisalign technique into the curriculum of university programs 
by educating dental students and orthodontic residents on the benefits of the invisalign technique  we believe they will be more likely to use this technology in their future practices and offer invisalign as a treatment option 
other resources that we offer our doctors include the aligntech institute www 
aligntechinstitute 
com  which is an interactive website that provides clinical education and practice development training 
these clinical education and practice development training opportunities include instructor led training classes  seminars and workshops  conference calls  web based videos  case studies  blogs and other clinical resources 
many of these courses and resources are eligible for continuing education ce credits 
additionally  our invisalign doctor site provides our trained doctors and their staff access to thousands of invisalign cases and best practices as well as up to date support information  programs and marketing materials for continuous support and information access 
customer support and practice development 
once a doctor is trained  we provide additional services to help our customers increase their confidence in using the invisalign system through clinical support and continuing education  as well as improving their practice management skills 
at our costa rica facility  we have over treatment technicians and customer support staff available to help our customers with their cases and treatment plans 
our sales representatives provide additional support and practice development tools such as staff training  clincheck software tips and tools  practice marketing guides and marketing materials  as well as any assistance with the invisalign system process 
customer incentive programs 
we offer our customers varying product promotional discounts and incentive programs as a means to improve the customer experience and increase utilization 
our largest north american program  the advantage rebate program  allows eligible orthodontist and gps to earn volume rebates and marketing benefits for exceeding quarterly case shipment thresholds and participating in continuing education 
additional tiered benefits range from practice development materials  marketing consulting  and access to dedicated clinical technicians 
for  we added an additional super elite tier to include benefits such as free invisalign summit attendance and an invisalign brand url license 
we believe that by incenting our doctors to enter the advantage rebate 
table of contents program and increase their tier status  doctors can gain increased confidence in treating with invisalign 
the program also gives doctors access to marketing materials and programs to better integrate invisalign into their practice and help develop a stronger partnership with us and increase overall adoption 
from time to time  we also offer various product promotions as a means to encourage trial usage of products  including pricing discounts to newly trained doctors and following the introduction of new products 
the largest program for international  the case pack program  rewards twelve month purchase commitments made by invisalign practitioners with case discounts commensurate with commitment tier and preferred placement in doctor locator on the invisalign website 
increasing the effectiveness of our consumer demand creation and extending invisalign brand awareness 
marketing to the consumer and creating demand is one of our key strategic objectives to driving long term growth 
our market research indicates that the majority of adults with malocclusion who desire treatment forgo treatment rather than elect traditional treatment due to its many limitations  such as compromised aesthetics and oral discomfort 
in addition  many parents also elect traditional treatment for their children due to limited awareness of invisalign applicability for teenager use 
our goals are to extend our leadership in clear aligner therapy with adults  increase awareness and consumer demand with moms and teens  and to continue expansion of the clear aligner category overall 
by communicating the benefits of invisalign to both dental professionals and consumers adults  parents and teens we intend to increase the number of patients who seek treatment using invisalign 
we continue to be successful with programs that more effectively and efficiently generate demand or pull for invisalign 
in  we became more efficient in our approach 
we continued building awareness and demand through an integrated consumer marketing platform of traditional media  event marketing and digital and social media 
in addition  we continued to evolve our marketing program aimed at the teenage segment to increase awareness and educate prospective teen patients and their parents 
specifically  we expanded our public relations and event marketing programs this past year for invisalign teen to include participation and sponsorship of major summer events such as the teen choice awards and journeyz backyard bbq tour  a nationwide action sports tour 
we leveraged online and mobile widgets  social media and blogs directly targeted to teens and launched a commercial prompting parents and teens to learn more about invisalign 
additionally  we evolved the invisalign brand strategy while refreshing the invisalign look and feel with a more modern logo and new brand positioning  updated consumer website  and base marketing materials focused on treatment outcome and practice growth 
we will continue to build on these programs and efforts in growth of international markets 
we will continue to focus our efforts towards increasing adoption of invisalign by dental professionals in our key international markets 
similar to the north america market  our objective internationally is to increase the number of doctors that are motivated to become an invisalign provider and committed to making invisalign a key part of their practices 
in  our international sales increased from approximately of net revenues to approximately of net revenues 
through december  we trained over  doctors internationally  predominantly orthodontists in europe which is our primary international market 
product line expansion is key to providing doctors with treatment options that address a wider range of potential patient needs with greater treatment flexibility 
invisalign teen will continue to gain adoption as specific europe teen marketing campaigns are being introduced in in addition  we are preparing to launch invisalign g in the second quarter of invisalign g is engineered to deliver even better clinical results  with new aligner and software features that make it easier to use invisalign with patient with class ii and class iii malocclusion 
due to the higher number of complex cases in international markets  the planned international launch of the invisalign g features designed to address those complex treatment issues is a significant near term focus 
we will carry on our efforts to increase brand awareness and consumer demand in europe by continuing our consumer advertising campaign while beginning to focus on the teenage segment 
in october  we announced that we had received regulatory approval from the chinese state food and drug administration sfda to market and sell the invisalign system as a class ii medical device for the treatment of malocclusion 
we received our license of medical device operation enterprise enterprise license from the 
table of contents shanghai food and drug administration  which allows us to distribute invisalign in china 
we expect to begin commercial availability of invisalign in the second half of while we do not expect meaningful revenue from china for several years  our focused strategy to launch invisalign in key major cities of china provides us a large growth opportunity long term 
additionally  although the vast majority of our international revenues are from direct sales  approximately of our international sales are through distributors covering less strategic international markets  specifically asia pacific  latin america  and smaller country markets in europe  the middle east and africa 
with these efforts  we expect our international revenues to continue to increase in absolute dollars and as a percentage of total net revenues in the foreseeable future

in the event that either of these vendors becomes unable for any reason to supply us with their respective products  we would experience a manufacturing disruption while we qualify and obtain an alternate source 
throughput management because we manufacture each case on a build to order basis  we must conservatively build manufacturing capacity for anticipated demand 
to increase throughput  we must improve the efficiency and increase the scale of our manufacturing processes 
in order to increase the efficiency of our manufacturing processes  we focus our efforts on software development and the improvement of rate limiting processes  or bottlenecks 
we continue to upgrade our proprietary  three dimensional treatment planning software to enhance computer analysis of treatment data and to reduce time spent on manual and judgmental tasks for each case  thereby increasing the efficiency of our technicians in costa rica 
we are also continuing the development of automated systems for the fabrication and packaging of aligners manufactured in juarez  mexico 
in order to meet the demands from expected volumes and continued international expansion  we expect that we will continue to invest in capital equipment and intend to add a new aligner fabrication facility outside of north america by the end of quality assurance align s quality system is required to be in compliance with the quality system regulations enforced by the food and drug administration fda  and similar regulations enforced by other worldwide regulatory 
table of contents authorities 
we are certified to en iso  an internationally recognized standard for medical device manufacturing 
we have a formal  documented quality system by which quality objectives are defined  understood and achieved 
systems  processes and procedures are implemented to ensure high levels of product and service quality 
we monitor the effectiveness of the quality system based on internal data and direct customer feedback and strive to continually improve our systems and processes  taking corrective action  as needed 
between june and august   the fda conducted a routine quality systems inspection of our san jose  california facility 
the fda inspection resulted in the issuance of a form notice that contained four observations related to how align reports and manages patient complaints 
we submitted a written response to the form notice on august and an additional written response on november that provided a full and complete update of the corrective actions we had taken to our complaint and medical device reporting procedures to address the observations 
on november   we received a warning letter from the fda  which requested additional documentation relating to our written implemented corrective actions 
on november  we submitted a written response to the warning letter that included copies of documentation requested by the fda 
we are continuing to work closely with the fda to resolve and close out the matter 
failure to fully address the fda s concerns could result in further regulatory sanctions  including additional warning letters  adverse publicity  refusal to clear or approve applications for new or modified products  injunctions  fines  civil penalties or criminal prosecution 
any fda enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 
since we custom manufacture our aligners on a build to order basis  we do not offer refunds on our products 
because each clincheck treatment plan and each aligner is unique  we inspect the product at various points during the manufacturing process  to ensure that the product meets our customers expectations 
aligners are subject to the invisalign product warranty  which covers defects in materials and workmanship 
our materials and workmanship warranty is in force until the invisalign case is completed 
in the event aligners fall within the scope of the invisalign product warranty  we will replace the aligners at our expense 
our warranty is contingent upon proper use of the aligners for the purposes for which they are intended 
if a patient chooses not to wear the aligners  and as a result  requests additional invisalign treatment  the dental professional pays the additional expense of the replacement aligners 
warranty treatment requires that the dental professional submit new impressions of the patient s dentition to us 
we use the impressions to create a new clincheck treatment plan for the dental professional to approve  from which a successive series of aligners will be produced that will allow the patient to finish treatment 
the invisalign product warranty does not provide any assurances regarding the outcome of treatment using invisalign 
actual treatment results may deviate significantly from the approved clincheck treatment plan 
deviations not covered under warranty have typically been the result of unpredictable biological factors  such as variations in bone density or tooth topography and abnormal jaw growth 
sales and marketing we market invisalign by communicating the benefits of the invisalign system to dental professionals through our training programs  online and traditional mail campaigns  trade shows  trade journals and print  and to consumers through online and traditional advertising  digital and social networking  and event marketing 
based on our experience with marketing and commercial sales  we believe that making consumers aware of invisalign as a treatment alternative generates significant demand for invisalign 
professional marketing we provide training  marketing and clinical support to orthodontists and gps throughout north america and internationally 
as of december   there are approximately  active invisalign providers worldwide 
as of december  our north american sales organization consisted of people  of which  were quota carrying sales representatives and were regional sales managers and administration 

table of contents internationally  we had people engaged in sales and sales support as of december  we continually evaluate cost effective ways to support our customers in smaller markets 
for instance  we use distributors for the sale of our products in part of the asia pacific  latin american regions  and smaller country markets in europe  the middle east and africa 
we will consider selling through a distributor in other smaller markets as well as consider expanding directly into additional countries on a case by case basis 
invisalign relies on the same orthodontic principles that apply to traditional treatment 
our sales teams conduct training primarily in a workshop format 
the key topics covered in training include invisalign applicability  instructions on filling out the invisalign treatment form and submitting required records  clinical tips and techniques  guidance on pricing and instructions on interacting with our clincheck software and the many other features of the invisalign doctor site 
after doctors complete their training  sales representatives may follow up with the dental professional to ensure that their staff is prepared to handle invisalign cases 
these practice development activities may include assisting the dental professional in taking dental impressions  treatment planning processes and familiarizing them with our dental online portals and tools 
sales representatives may also provide practice building assistance  including helping the dental professional to market invisalign to prospective patients through direct mail or other forms of media 
many dental professionals have commenced promotional activity in their local region with our assistance 
consumer marketing our experience indicates that prospective patients seek information from these primary sources an orthodontist  a gp  our websites  which can be accessed at either www 
invisalign 
com  www 
invisalignteen 
com  www 
aligntech 
com  or www 
aligntechinstitute 
com  traditional and digital advertising  social media  print and public relations and  word of mouth from current and former invisalign patients 
research and development our research and development effort is focused on extending the range of clinical effectiveness and applicability of invisalign  enhancing the software used in the virtual clinical design  manufacturing process and enhancing our invisalign treatment options  including the development of distinct product platforms that meet the specific needs of gps and orthodontists such as invisalign assist and invisalign teen 
our research and development expenses were million for  million for  and million for in an effort to demonstrate invisalign s broad treatment capabilities  various clinical case studies and articles have been published that highlight the applicability of invisalign to malocclusion cases  including those of severe complexity 
we are also undertaking post marketing studies and making additional technological improvements to the product and manufacturing process 
as mentioned in our business strategy  we are making investments in the development of new products and enhancements of existing products to meet the needs of our customers and increase adoption and utilization of invisalign such as the agreement to jointly develop software applications with cadent 
intellectual property we believe our intellectual property position represents a substantial business advantage 
as of december   we had issued us patents  pending us patent applications  and foreign issued patents  as well as pending foreign patent applications 
see item legal proceedings for a discussion on reexamination proceedings pending with the united states patent and trademark office 

table of contents we continue to pursue further intellectual property protection through us and foreign patent applications and non disclosure agreements 
we also seek to protect our software  documentation and other written materials under trade secret and copyright laws 
we cannot be certain that patents will be issued as a result of any patent application or that patents that have been issued to us or that may be issued in the future will be found to be valid and enforceable and sufficient to protect our technology or products 
our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries where invisalign is distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 
information regarding risks associated with failing to protect our proprietary technology and our intellectual property rights may be found in item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
seasonal fluctuations seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and available to take appointments have affected  and are likely to continue to affect  our business 
specifically  our customers often take vacation or are on holiday during the summer months and therefore tend to start fewer cases  particularly in europe 
in addition  summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients as many parents want to get their teens started in treatment before the start of the school year 
as a result  adult appointments  including adult invisalign patient starts  are often pushed further into late summer or early fall 
with the availability of invisalign teen combined with our marketing efforts aimed at teens and parents  we have been actively competing for a share of teen patient starts 
we believe that the increasing percentage of teenaged patients using invisalign helped moderate the downward trend we would otherwise see for our north american orthodontic customers during the summer months 
these seasonal trends have caused and will likely continue to cause  fluctuations in our quarterly results  including fluctuations in sequential revenue growth rates 
backlog due to the nature of our business  we maintain relatively low levels of backlog 
the period from which treatment data or a case is received until the acceptance of the digital clincheck treatment plan is dependent on the dental professional s discretion to modify  accept or cancel the treatment plan 
therefore  we consider the case a firm order to manufacture aligners once the dental professional has approved the clincheck treatment plan 
our backlog consists of clincheck treatment plans that have been accepted but not yet shipped 
because aligners are shipped shortly after the clincheck treatment plan has been accepted  we believe that backlog is not a good indicator of future sales 
our quarterly revenues can be impacted by the timing of the clincheck treatment plan acceptances and our ability to ship those cases in the same quarter 
competition we compete for the attention of dental professionals with manufacturers of traditional orthodontic appliances or wires and brackets  which include m s unitek  danaher corporation s sybron dental specialties  and dentsply international  inc we also compete directly with established companies that manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign  including the products manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics  a division of sybron dental specialties a division of danaher corporation and dentsply gac international a division of dentsply international  inc 
in the future  we may face further competition from early stage and more mature companies who enter our target markets to manufacture and distribute products that are similar in use to invisalign 
information regarding risks associated with increased competition may be found in item a of this annual report on form k under the heading risk factors 
we believe that in addition to price  the principal competitive factors in the market for orthodontic appliances include the following aesthetic appeal of the treatment method  
table of contents effectiveness of treatment  customer support  software features  customer online interface  unique engineering  comfort associated with the treatment method  oral hygiene  ease of use  and dental professionals chair time 
we believe that invisalign compares favorably with our competitors products with respect to each of these factors 
government regulation fda s quality system regulation for medical devices 
the invisalign system is classified as a class ii medical device 
in  we received pre market clearance from the fda pursuant to the k pre market notification procedure  allowing us to market the product in the us the invisalign system was originally cleared for use by the fda in patients with permanent teeth and contraindicated the device for patients presenting with mixed dentition  severe overbite  severe overjet  tooth malocclusion requiring surgical correction  adolescent patients with a skeletally narrow jaw  and adult patients with dental prosthetics implants 
in  the fda cleared new labeling for the invisalign system  by removing the permanent dentition limitation from the indications for use 
in addition  certain conditions previously listed as contraindications are now listed as precautions 
we are subject to routine inspections by the fda and state agencies to determine compliance with quality system requirements 
we are registered with the state of california as a medical device manufacturer 
if the fda determines that we failed to comply with the applicable fda regulations  it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions against us  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions  including but not limited to financial penalties  withdrawal of our right to market our products and criminal prosecution 
health canada s medical device regulations 
in canada  we are required to comply with health canada s medical device regulations 
our products are registered with health canada 
we believe we are in compliance with their regulations and have been granted clearance to market our products in canada 
european union s mdd requirements iso in europe  invisalign is regulated as a custom device and as such  we follow the requirements of the medical device directives 
we are iso certified  which facilitates commercialization of invisalign outside the united states and especially in europe 
china s fda regulations and enterprise license 
in october  we received regulatory approval from the chinese state food and drug administration sfda to market and sell the invisalign system as a class ii medical device for the treatment of malocclusion 
we also received its license of medical device operation enterprise enterprise license from the shanghai food and drug administration  which allows us to distribute invisalign in china 
health insurance portability and accountability act of under the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa  congress mandated a package of interlocking administrative simplification rules to establish standards and requirements for electronic transmission of certain health 
table of contents information 
confidentiality and security of patient records and the circumstances under which these records may be released by healthcare professionals are subject to substantial regulations under the hipaa standards for privacy of individually identifiable health information  referred to as the privacy standard  and the security standard  and other state laws and regulations 
the privacy standard governs both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information  and the security standard governs the technical  physical  and administrative safe guards used to protect the unauthorized release or disclosure of patient information 
although compliance is the responsibility of the hospital  physician or other healthcare provider  we understand the importance to our customers and their patients of maintaining the confidentiality of patient information 
accordingly  we have designed our product and service offerings to be consistent with the requirements of the privacy and security standards under hipaa and applicable corresponding state laws and regulations 
maintaining systems that are consistent with these laws and regulations is costly and could require complex changes in the way we do business or provide services to our patients 
additionally  our success may be dependent on the success of healthcare participants in dealing with hipaa requirements 
other federal and state laws 
as a participant in the health care industry we are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulation under many other laws administered by governmental entities at the federal  state and local levels  some of which are  and others of which may be  applicable to our business 
we are a medical device manufacturer subject to fda regulations 
these regulations  among other things  require that we maintain device and facilities registrations and listings as well as promote our products as permitted by our fda clearances 
furthermore  our health care service provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 
laws regulating medical device manufacturers and health care providers cover a broad array of subjects 
for example  the confidentiality of patient medical information and the circumstances under which such information may be used by us  released for inclusion in our databases  or released by us to third parties  are subject to substantial regulation by state governments 
these state laws and regulations govern both the disclosure and the use of confidential patient medical information and are evolving rapidly 
in addition  provisions under the federal anti kickback statutes prohibit  among other things  paying or offering to pay any remuneration in exchange for the referral of patients to a person participating in  or for the order  purchase or recommendation of items or services that are subject to reimbursement by  medicare  medicaid and other similar federal or state health care programs 
most states have also enacted illegal remuneration laws that are similar to the federal laws 
these laws  which are evolving at the federal and state levels  are applicable to our financial relationships with  and any marketing or other promotional activities involving  our dental professional customers 
violations of any of these laws or regulations could subject us to a variety of civil and criminal sanctions 
furthermore  various state laws require us to report payments and other transfers of value made to dental professionals and teaching hospitals to state regulatory bodies  and federal law will require us to track and disclose these payments starting in employees as of december   we had  employees  including  in manufacturing and operations  in sales and marketing  in research and development and in general and administrative functions 
we had employees in north america  employees in costa rica  employees in europe  employees in mexico  and employees in japan

table of contents item a 
risk factors we depend on the sale of the invisalign system for the vast majority of our revenues  and any decline in sales of invisalign for any reason  including as a result of changes to the proficiency program  a continued weakness in general economic conditions  or a decline in average selling prices would adversely affect revenues  gross margin and net profits 
we expect that revenues from the sale of the invisalign system will continue to account for the vast majority of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
continued and widespread market acceptance of invisalign by orthodontists  gps and consumers is critical to our future success 
if orthodontists and gps experience a reduction in consumer demand for orthodontic services  if consumers prove unwilling to adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate or in the volume that we anticipate  if orthodontists or gps choose to use a competitive product rather than invisalign or if the average selling price of our product declines  our operating results would be harmed 
factors that could cause the adoption of invisalign to occur at a lower rate than we expect  as well as the risk related to declining average selling prices are described more fully below 
consumers may not adopt invisalign as rapidly as we anticipate due to a variety of factors including a continued weakness in general economic conditions 
consumer spending habits are affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions  levels of employment  salaries and wage rates  gas prices  consumer confidence and consumer perception of economic conditions 
a general slowdown in the united states economy and certain international economies or an uncertain economic outlook would adversely affect consumer spending habits which may  among other things  result in a decrease in the number of overall orthodontic case starts or a reduction in the demand for invisalign generally either of which would have a material adverse effect on our sales and operating results 
in addition  invisalign represents a significant change from traditional orthodontic treatment  and consumers may be reluctant to accept it or may not find it preferable to traditional treatment 
we have generally received positive feedback from orthodontists  gps and consumers regarding invisalign as both an alternative to braces and as a clinical method for treatment of malocclusion  but a number of dental professionals believe that invisalign is appropriate for only a limited percentage of their patients 
increased market acceptance will depend in part upon the recommendations of dental professionals  as well as other factors including effectiveness  safety  ease of use  reliability  aesthetics  greater comfort and hygiene compared to traditional orthodontic products and price for invisalign compared to competing products 
orthodontists and gps may not adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate for a number of reasons  including  changes to the proficiency program or as a result of increased competition 
our success depends upon increasing acceptance and frequency of use of the invisalign system by dental professionals what we refer to as utilization 
in april  we eliminated the case start requirements and in october we eliminated the annual ce requirements  effectively terminating the proficiency program 
we may experience variability in customer activity over the next several quarters as doctors adjust to the changes to the proficiency program requirements 
in addition  increased competition from direct competitors could cause us to lose market share and reduce dental professionals efforts and commitment to expand their invisalign practice 
if adoption does not increase as we anticipate for any reason  our revenues may fail to grow as expected and our operating results may be harmed 
the frequency of use by orthodontists or gps may not increase at the rate that we anticipate or at all 
one of our key objectives is to continue to increase utilization  or the adoption and frequency of use  of the invisalign system by new and existing customers 
if utilization of invisalign by our existing and newly trained orthodontists or gps does not occur or does not occur as quickly as we anticipate  our operating results could be harmed 

table of contents we may experience declines in average selling prices of our products 
in response to challenges in our business  including increased competition  we have in the past reduced the list price of our products 
we also provide volume based discount programs to our doctors 
in addition  we sell a number of products at different list prices 
if we introduce any price reductions  or consumer rebate programs  expand our discount programs in the future  if participation in these programs increases  if our product mix shifts to lower priced products or newer products that have a higher percentage of deferred revenue  or if sales by our international distributors  particularly in the asia pacific region  grows at a faster pace than our direct sales  our average selling price would be adversely affected and our revenues  gross margin and net profits losses may be reduced 
furthermore  although the us dollar is our reporting currency  a portion of our revenues and profits are generated in foreign currencies 
revenues and profits generated by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and are affected by changes in exchange rates 
as a result  negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will adversely affect our average selling price and consequently the amount of revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements 
as we continue to grow  we are subject to growth related risks  including risks related to capacity constraints at our existing facilities 
we are subject to growth related risks  including capacity constraints and pressure on our internal systems and personnel 
in order to manage current operations and future growth effectively  we will need to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems and to hire  train  motivate  manage and retain employees 
we may be unable to manage such growth effectively 
any such failure could have a material adverse impact on our business  operations and prospects 
in addition  in order to meet the demands from expected volumes and continued international expansion  we intend to open a new manufacturing facility outside of north america by the end of our ability to plan  construct and equip additional manufacturing facilities is subject to significant risk and uncertainty  including risks inherent in the establishment of a new manufacturing facility  such as hiring and retaining employees  delays and cost overruns as a result of a number of factors  any of which may be out of our control  such as labor shortages and disputes  delays in government approvals  delays in the customization  delivery and installation of equipment  and production start up problems  implementing  integrating and improving operational and financial systems  procedures and controls  including our computer systems  and managing expanding operations in multiple locations and multiple time zones 
if the opening of this facility is significantly delayed or demand for our product in exceeds our current expectations  we may not be able to fulfill orders timely  which may negatively impact our financial results and overall business 
conversely  if demand for our products decreases  the fixed costs associated with excess manufacturing capacity may harm our financial results 
if we fail to sustain or increase profitability or revenue growth in future periods  the market price for our common stock may decline 
if we are to sustain or increase profitability in future periods  we will need to continue to increase our revenues  while controlling our expenses 
because our business is evolving  it is difficult to predict our future 
table of contents operating results or levels of growth  and we have in the past not been and may in the future not be able to sustain our historical growth rates 
if we do not increase profitability or revenue growth or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock will likely decline 
our financial results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future which may cause volatility in our stock price 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and we expect our future quarterly and annual operating results to fluctuate as we focus on increasing doctor and consumer demand for our products 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include limited visibility into and difficulty predicting the level of activity in our customers practices from quarter to quarter  weakness in consumer spending as a result of the slowdown in the united states economy and global economies  changes in the timing of receipt of case product orders during a given quarter which  given our cycle time and the delay between case receipts and case shipments  could have an impact on which quarter revenue can be recognized  fluctuations in currency exchange rates against the us dollar  changes in product mix  if participation in our customer rebate program increases our average selling price will be adversely affected  seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and their availability to take appointments  success of or changes to our marketing programs from quarter to quarter  changes in the timing of when revenue is recognized  including as a result of the introduction of new products or promotions or as a result of changes to critical accounting estimates or new accounting pronouncements  changes to our effective tax rate  unanticipated delays in production caused by insufficient capacity  any disruptions in the manufacturing process  including unexpected turnover in the labor force or the introduction of new production processes  power outages or natural or other disasters beyond our control  the development and marketing of directly competitive products by existing and new competitors  aggressive price competition from competitors  costs and expenditures in connection with litigation  disruptions to our business due to the impact of an epidemic that results in changes in consumer spending habits  consumers unable or unwilling to visit the orthodontist or general practitioners office  as well as any impact on workforce absenteeism  inaccurate forecasting of revenues  production and other operating costs  and investments in research and development to develop new products and enhancements to invisalign 

table of contents to respond to these and other factors  we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy  business structure or operations 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and lease payment obligations  are relatively fixed in the short term 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue levels 
as a result  if our revenues for a particular period fall below our expectations  whether caused by changes in consumer spending  consumer preferences  weakness in the us or global economies  changes in customer behavior related to advertising and prescribing our product  or other factors  we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any shortfall in revenues 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful 
you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance 
our future success may depend on our ability to develop  successfully introduce and achieve market acceptance of new products 
our future success may depend on our ability to develop  manufacture  market  and obtain regulatory approval or clearance of new products 
we launched invisalign teen in july and invisalign assist in october in october  we introduced invisalign g  a collection of new features and innovations that touch every product and virtually every system at align 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop  sell and achieve market acceptance of these and other new products and applications and enhanced versions of our existing product 
the extent of  and rate at which  market acceptance and penetration are achieved by future products is a function of many variables  which include  among other things  our ability to include functionality and features that address customer requirements  compatibility of our computer operating systems and hardware configurations with customers  the availability of third party reimbursement of procedures using our new products  the existence of competing products and general economic conditions affecting purchasing patterns 
in addition  even if our new products are successfully introduced  it is unlikely that they will rapidly gain market share and acceptance primarily due to the relatively long period of time it takes to successfully treat a patient 
since it takes approximately to months to treat a patient  our customers may be unwilling to rapidly adopt our new products until they successfully complete at least one case or until more historical clinical results are available 
our ability to market and sell new products may also be subject to government regulation  including approval or clearance by the united states food and drug administration fda  and foreign government agencies 
any failure in our ability to successfully develop and introduce or achieve market acceptance of our new products or enhanced versions of existing products could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and could cause our revenues to decline 
a disruption in the operations of our primary freight carrier or higher shipping costs could cause a decline in our revenues or a reduction in our earnings 
we are dependent on commercial freight carriers  primarily ups  to deliver our products 
if the operations of these carriers are disrupted for any reason  we may be unable to deliver our products to our customers on a timely basis 
if we cannot deliver our products in an efficient and timely manner  our customers may reduce their orders from us and our revenues and operating profits could materially decline 
in a rising fuel cost environment  our freight costs will increase 
if freight costs materially increase and we are unable to pass that increase along to our customers for any reason or otherwise offset such increases in our cost of revenues  our gross margin and financial results could be adversely affected 
we are dependent on our international operations  which exposes us to foreign operational  political and other risks that may harm our business 
our key production steps are performed in operations located outside of the us at our facility in costa rica  technicians use a sophisticated  internally developed computer modeling program to prepare digital treatment plans  which are then transmitted electronically to juarez  mexico 
these digital files form the basis of 
table of contents the clincheck treatment plan and are used to manufacture aligner molds 
our order acquisition  aligner fabrication and shipping operations are conducted in juarez  mexico 
in addition to the research and development efforts conducted in our san jose  california facility  we also carry out research and development at locations in san jose  costa rica and moscow  russia 
in addition  our customer care  accounts receivable  credit and collections and customer event registration organizations are located at our facility in costa rica 
our reliance on international operations exposes us to risks and uncertainties that may affect our business or results of operation  including difficulties in hiring and retaining employees generally  as well as difficulties in hiring and retaining employees with the necessary skills to perform the more technical aspects of our operations  difficulties in managing international operations  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  import and export license requirements and restrictions  controlling production volume and quality of the manufacturing process  political  social and economic instability  including as a result of increased levels of violence in juarez  mexico  acts of terrorism and acts of war  interruptions and limitations in telecommunication services  product or material transportation delays or disruption  including as a result of health epidemics restricting travel to and from mexico or as a result of natural disasters  such as earthquakes or volcanic eruptions  burdens of complying with a wide variety of local country and regional laws  trade restrictions and changes in tariffs  and potential adverse tax consequences 
if any of these risks materialize in the future  we could experience production delays and lost or delayed revenue 
a key step in our manufacturing process relies on sophisticated computer technology that requires new technicians to undergo a relatively long training process 
if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth  and fail to hire a sufficient number of technicians in advance of such demand  the delivery time of our products could be delayed which could adversely affect our results of operations 
training technicians to use our sophisticated computer modeling program that produces the digital treatment plan that forms the basis of clincheck takes approximately to days 
as a result  if we are unable to accurately predict our volume growth  we may not have a sufficient number of trained technicians to timely create clincheck treatment plans within the timeframe our customers expect 
any delay in clincheck processing time could delay the ultimate delivery of finished aligners to our customers 
such a delay could cause us to lose existing customers or fail to attract new customers 
this could cause a decline in our revenues and net profits and could adversely affect our results of operations 
our headquarters  digital dental modeling processes  and other manufacturing processes are all principally located in regions that are subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our digital dental modeling is processed in our facility located in san jose  costa rica 
the operations team in costa rica creates clincheck treatment plans using sophisticated computer software 
in addition  our customer facing operations are located in costa rica 
our aligner molds and finished aligners are fabricated in 
table of contents juarez  mexico 
both costa rica and mexico are in earthquake zones and may be subject to other natural disasters 
if there is a major earthquake or any other natural disaster in a region where one of these facilities is located  our ability to create clincheck treatment plans  respond to customer inquiries or manufacture and ship our aligners could be compromised which could result in our customers experiencing a significant delay in receiving their completed aligners and a decrease in service levels for a period of time 
in addition  our headquarters facility is located in the san francisco bay area 
an earthquake or other natural disaster in this region could result in a disruption in our operations 
any such business interruption could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we experience competition from manufacturers of traditional braces and expect aggressive competition from these and other companies that may introduce new technologies in the future 
currently  our invisalign product competes directly against products manufactured and distributed by ormco orthodontics  a division of sybron dental specialties a danaher corporation subsidiary  and traditional braces manufactured by m s unitek and dentsply international 
these manufacturers have substantially greater financial resources and manufacturing and marketing experience than we do and may  in the future  attempt to develop an orthodontic system similar to ours or combine technologies that make our product economically unattractive 
large consumer product companies may also enter the orthodontic supply market 
furthermore  we may face competition in the future from new companies that may introduce new technologies 
we may be unable to compete with these competitors and one or more of these competitors may render our technology obsolete or economically unattractive 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing products or respond effectively to any products developed by new or existing competitors  our business could be harmed 
increased competition has resulted in the past and may in the future result in volume discounting and price reductions  reduced gross margins  reduced profitability and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  volume growth  net profit losses and stock price 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that competitive pressures will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our information technology systems are critical to our business 
system integration and implementation issues and system security risks could disrupt our operations  which could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems 
all information technology systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources 
as our business has grown in size and complexity  the growth has placed  and will continue to place  significant demands on our information technology systems 
to effectively manage this growth  we will need to continually upgrade and enhance our information systems 
in addition  experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties  create system disruptions or cause shutdowns 
furthermore  sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we either internally develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design and manufacture  including bugs and other problems that can unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system 
the costs to eliminate or alleviate security problems  viruses and bugs could be significant  and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions that may have a material adverse impact on our operations  revenues and operating results 
we are currently focused on adding more functionality into our business enterprise systems to more efficiently integrate these systems with our other system applications  such as customer facing and manufacturing tools  and intend to continue this effort for the foreseeable future 
system upgrades and enhancements  including those upgrades and enhancements associated with the launch in the fall of of invisalign g that touched every product and virtually each of our systems  require significant expenditures and allocation of valuable employee resources 
delays in integration or disruptions to our business from implementation of these new or upgraded systems could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and operating results 
furthermore  we continuously upgrade our customer facing software applications  specifically the 
table of contents clincheck software and the invisalign doctor site 
software applications frequently contain errors or defects  especially when they are first introduced or when new versions are released 
the discovery of a defect or error or the incompatibility with the computer operating system and hardware configurations of customers in a new upgraded version or the failure of our primary information systems may result in the following consequences  among others loss of revenue or delay in market acceptance  damage to our reputation or increased service costs  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our success depends in part on our proprietary technology  and if we are unable to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position may be harmed 
litigating claims of this type is costly and could distract our management and cause a decline in our results of operations and stock price 
our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain existing intellectual property and to obtain and maintain further intellectual property protection for our products  both in the us and in other countries 
our inability to do so could harm our competitive position 
as of december   we had issued us patents  pending us patent applications  and issued foreign patents  and pending foreign patent applications 
we intend to rely on our portfolio of issued and pending patent applications in the us and in other countries to protect a large part of our intellectual property and our competitive position 
however  our currently pending or future patent filings may not result in the issuance of patents 
additionally  any patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated  held unenforceable  circumvented  or may not be sufficiently broad to prevent third parties from producing competing products similar in design to our products 
in addition  any protection afforded by foreign patents may be more limited than that provided under us patents and intellectual property laws 
we also rely on protection of our copyrights  trade secrets  know how and proprietary information 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and our collaborative partners upon commencement of a relationship with us 
however  these agreements may not provide meaningful protection against the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or other confidential information  and adequate remedies may not exist if unauthorized use or disclosure were to occur 
our inability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology through patents  copyrights or trade secrets would impair our competitive advantages and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
in particular  a failure to protect our proprietary rights might allow competitors to copy our technology  which could adversely affect our pricing and market share 
in addition  in an effort to protect our intellectual property we have in the past been and may in the future be involved in litigation 
the potential effects on our business operations resulting from litigation that we may participate in the future  whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us  are costly and divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include monetary damages or  in cases where injunctive relief is sought  an injunction prohibiting us from selling our products 
any of these results from our litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are required to assess our internal control over financial reporting on an annual basis and any future adverse results from such assessment could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of and the rules and regulations promulgated by the sec  we are required to furnish in our form k an annual report by our management regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
the report includes  among other things  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include 
table of contents disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
while we currently believe our internal control over financial reporting is effective  the effectiveness of our internal controls to future periods is subject to the risk that our controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  and  as a result  the degree of compliance of our internal control over financial reporting with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective in any future period or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or conclude that our internal controls are ineffective  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain key personnel  we may be unable to pursue business opportunities or develop our products 
we are highly dependent on the key employees in our clinical engineering  technology development  sales and marketing personnel and management teams 
the loss of the services provided by those individuals may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our product development and other business objectives and could harm our business 
our future success will also depend on our ability to identify  recruit  train and retain additional qualified personnel  including orthodontists 
few orthodontists are accustomed to working in a manufacturing environment since they are generally trained to work in private practices  universities and other research institutions 
thus  we may be unable to attract and retain personnel with the advanced qualifications necessary for the further development of our business 
furthermore  we may not be successful in retaining our key personnel or their services 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our business could be materially harmed 
if we infringe the patents or proprietary rights of other parties or are subject to a patent infringement claim  our ability to grow our business may be severely limited 
extensive litigation over patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the medical device industry 
we have been sued for infringement of third party s patents in the past and we may be the subject of patent or other litigation in the future 
from time to time  we have received and may in the future receive letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights 
while we do not believe that we infringe upon any valid and enforceable rights that have been brought to our attention  there may be other more pertinent rights of which we are presently unaware 
the defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits  interference proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings could result in substantial expense to us and significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel 
an adverse determination of any litigation or interference proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities 
an adverse determination of this nature could also put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly or require us to seek licenses from third parties 
licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  in which event  our business would be materially adversely affected 
we maintain single supply relationships for certain of our key machines and materials technologies  and our business and operating results could be harmed if supply is restricted or ends or the price of raw materials used in our manufacturing process increases 
we are highly dependent on manufacturers of specialized scanning equipment  rapid prototyping machines  resin and other advanced materials 
we maintain single supply relationships for many of these machines and materials technologies 
in particular  our scanning and stereolithography equipment are provided by a single supplier 
we are also committed to purchasing all of our resin and polymer  the primary raw materials used in our manufacturing process  from a single source 
in addition  technology changes by our vendors could disrupt access to required manufacturing capacity or require expensive  time consuming development efforts to adapt and integrate new equipment or processes 
our growth may exceed the capacity of one or more of these 
table of contents manufacturers to produce the needed equipment and materials in sufficient quantities to support our growth 
in the event of technology changes  delivery delays  or shortages of or increases in price for these items  our business and growth prospects may be harmed 
we rely on our direct sales force to sell our products  and any failure to maintain our direct sales force could harm our business 
our ability to sell our products and generate revenues depends upon our direct sales force within our north american and international markets 
as of december   our north american sales organization consisted of people  of which were quota carrying sales representatives and were regional sales managers and administration 
internationally  we had people engaged in sales and sales support as of december  we do not have any long term employment contracts with the members of our direct sales force 
the loss of the services provided by these key personnel may harm our business 
if we are unable to retain our direct sales force personnel or replace them with individuals of equivalent technical expertise and qualifications  or if we are unable to successfully instill such technical expertise or if we fail to establish strong relationships with our customers within a relatively short period of time  our revenues and our ability to maintain market share could be materially harmed 
in addition  due to our large and fragmented customer base  we may not be able to provide all of our customers with product support immediately upon the launch of a new product 
as a result  adoption of new products by our customers may be slower than anticipated and our ability to grow market share and increase our revenues may be harmed 
complying with regulations enforced by the fda and other regulatory authorities is an expensive and time consuming process  and any failure to comply could result in substantial penalties 
our products are medical devices and are subject to extensive regulation in the us and internationally 
fda regulations are wide ranging and govern  among other things product design  development  manufacturing and testing  product labeling  product storage  pre market clearance or approval  advertising and promotion  and product sales and distribution 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the fda or state agencies  which may include any of the following sanctions warning letters  fines  injunctions  consent decrees and civil penalties  repair  replacement  refunds  recall or seizure of our products  operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production  refusing our requests for k clearance or pre market approval of new products  new intended uses  or modifications to existing products  withdrawing clearance or pre market approvals that have already been granted  and criminal prosecution 
if any of these events were to occur  they could harm our business 
we must comply with facility registration and product listing requirements of the fda and adhere to applicable quality system regulations 
the fda enforces its quality system regulations through periodic unannounced inspections 
for 
table of contents instance  on november   we received a warning letter from the fda  which requested additional documentation relating to our written implemented corrective actions to our complaint and medical device reporting procedures 
we responded to the warning letter on november   and we are working closely with the fda to address their concerns and close the matter 
should we fail to promptly and fully address the issues listed in the warning letter may result in further regulatory sanctions  including additional warning letters  adverse publicity  refusal to clear or approve applications for new or modified products  injunctions  fines  civil penalties or criminal prosecution 
any fda enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us 
before we can sell a new medical device in the us  or market a new use of or claim for an existing product we must obtain fda clearance or approval  unless an exemption applies 
obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals can be a lengthy and time consuming process 
even though the devices we market have obtained the necessary clearances from the fda  we may be unable to maintain such clearances in the future 
furthermore  we may be unable to obtain the necessary clearances for new devices that we intend to market in the future 
our inability to maintain or obtain regulatory clearances or approvals could materially harm our business 
if the security of our customer and patient information is compromised  patient care could suffer  and we could be liable for related damages  and our reputation could be impaired 
we retain confidential customer and patient information in our processing centers 
therefore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace and our customers to be secure 
despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems 
if we fail to meet our clients expectations regarding the security of healthcare information  we could be liable for damages and our reputation could be impaired 
in addition  patient care could suffer  and we could be liable if our systems fail to deliver correct information in a timely manner 
our insurance may not protect us from this risk 
if compliance with healthcare regulations becomes costly and difficult for our customers or for us  we may not be able to grow our business 
participants in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive and frequently changing regulations under numerous laws administered by governmental entities at the federal  state and local levels  some of which are  and others of which may be  applicable to our business 
in response to perceived increases in health care costs in recent years  congress recently passed health care reform legislation that president obama signed into law in march the enacted legislation contains many provisions designed to generate the revenues necessary to fund the coverage expansions 
the most relevant of these provisions are those that impose fees or taxes on certain health related industries  including medical device manufacturers 
beginning in  each medical device manufacturer will have to pay an excise tax in an amount equal to percent of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices 
this tax applies to all medical devices  including our products 
these taxes  will result in a significant increase in the tax burden on our industry  which could have a material  negative impact on our results of operations and our cash flows 
furthermore  our healthcare provider customers are also subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations that could affect the nature and scope of their relationships with us 
the healthcare market itself is highly regulated and subject to changing political  economic and regulatory influences 
regulations implemented pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act hipaa  including regulations affecting the security and privacy of patient healthcare information held by healthcare providers and their business associates may require us to make significant and unplanned enhancements of software applications or services  result in delays or cancellations of orders  or result in the revocation of endorsement of our products and services by healthcare participants 
the effect of hipaa and newly enforced regulations on our business is difficult to predict  and there can be no assurance that we will adequately address the business risks created by hipaa and its implementation or that we will be able to take advantage of any resulting business opportunities 

table of contents extensive and changing government regulation of the healthcare industry may be expensive to comply with and exposes us to the risk of substantial government penalties 
in addition to medical device laws and regulations  numerous state and federal healthcare related laws regulate our business  covering areas such as storage  transmission and disclosure of medical information and healthcare records  prohibitions against the offer  payment or receipt of remuneration to induce referrals to entities providing healthcare services or goods or to induce the order  purchase or recommendation of our products  and the marketing and advertising of our products 
complying with these laws and regulations could be expensive and time consuming  and could increase our operating costs or reduce or eliminate certain of our sales and marketing activities or our revenues 
we face risks related to our international sales  including the need to obtain necessary foreign regulatory clearance or approvals 
we currently sell our products in europe  asia pacific  latin america and japan and may expand into other countries from time to time 
we do not know whether orthodontists  gps and consumers outside our north american market will adopt invisalign in sufficient numbers or as rapidly as we anticipate 
in addition  sales of our products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
the time required to obtain clearances or approvals required by other countries may be longer than that required for fda clearance or approval  and requirements for such approvals may differ from fda requirements 
we may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals in one or more of the other countries in which we do business or in which we may do business in the future 
we may also incur significant costs in attempting to obtain and maintain foreign regulatory approvals 
if we experience delays in receipt of approvals to market our products outside of the us  or if we fail to receive these approvals  we may be unable to market our products or enhancements in international markets in a timely manner  if at all 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims  and we may incur substantial expenses if we are subject to product liability claims or litigation 
medical devices involve an inherent risk of product liability claims and associated adverse publicity 
we may be held liable if any product we develop or any product that uses or incorporates any of our technologies causes injury or is otherwise found unsuitable 
although we intend to continue to maintain product liability insurance  adequate insurance may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities 
a product liability claim  regardless of its merit or eventual outcome  could result in significant legal defense costs 
these costs would have the effect of increasing our expenses and diverting management s attention away from the operation of our business  and could harm our business 
historically  the market price for our common stock has been volatile 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to wide price fluctuations in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the factors include quarterly variations in our results of operations and liquidity  changes in recommendations by the investment community or in their estimates of our revenues or operating results  speculation in the press or investment community concerning our business and results of operations  strategic actions by our competitors  such as product announcements or acquisitions  
table of contents announcements of technological innovations or new products by us  our customers or competitors  and general economic market conditions 
in addition  the stock market in general  and the market for technology and medical device companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
historically  class action litigation is often brought against an issuing company following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
a securities class action suit was filed against us on behalf of all persons or entities who purchased our common stock between january  and october  while we believe the lawsuit is without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves  we could incur substantial legal fees  and our management s attention and resources may be diverted from operating our business in order to respond to the litigation 
future sales of significant amounts of our common stock may depress our stock price 
a large percentage of our outstanding common stock is currently owned by a small number of significant stockholders 
these stockholders have sold in the past  and may sell in the future  large amounts of common stock over relatively short periods of time 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
such sales could create public perception of difficulties or problems with our business and may depress our stock price 
changes in  or interpretations of  accounting rules and regulations  could result in unfavorable accounting charges 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting policies 
a change in these policies can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even retroactively affect previously reported transactions 
our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows revenue recognition  accounting for share based payments  leases  and accounting for income taxes 
if we fail to manage our exposure to global financial and securities market risk successfully  our operating results and financial statements could be materially impacted 
the primary objective of most of our investment activities is to preserve principal 
to achieve this objective  a majority of our marketable investments are investment grade  liquid  short term fixed income securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars 
if the carrying value of our investments exceeds the fair value  and the decline in fair value is deemed to be other than temporary  we will be required to write down the value of our investments  which could materially harm our results of operations and financial condition 
moreover  the performance of certain securities in our investment portfolio correlates with the credit condition of the us financial sector 
in an current unstable credit environment  we might incur significant realized  unrealized or impairment losses associated with these investments 
we have adopted a shareholders rights plan to limit the possibility that we are acquired  which may mean that a transaction that shareholders are in favor of or are benefited by may be prevented 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of such shares without any further vote or action by our 
table of contents shareholders 
to date  our board of directors has designated  shares as series a participating preferred stock in connection with our shareholder rights plan 
the issuance of preferred stock under certain circumstances could have the effect of delaying or preventing an acquisition of align or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of the holders of our stock 
the shareholder rights plan may have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition of our company which is deemed undesirable by our board of directors 
the shareholder rights plan may cause substantial dilution to a person or group attempting to acquire us on terms or in a manner not approved by our board of directors  except pursuant to an offer conditioned on the negation  purchase or redemption of the rights issued under the shareholder rights plan 
our effective tax rate may vary significantly from period to period 
various internal and external factors may have favorable or unfavorable effects on our future effective tax rate 
these factors include  but are not limited to  changes in tax laws  regulations and or rates  changing interpretations of existing tax laws or regulations  the future levels of tax benefits of stock option deductions relating to incentive stock options and employee stock purchase plans and changes in overall levels of pretax earnings 
in june  the costa rica ministry of foreign trade  an agency of the government of costa rica  granted a twelve year extension of the tax incentives which were previously granted in under these incentives  all of the income we earn in costa rica during these twelve year incentive periods is subject to reduced rates of costa rica income tax 
the incentive tax rates will expire in various years beginning in the costa rica corporate income tax rate that would apply  absent the incentives  is for as a result of these incentives  income taxes were reduced by million in in order to receive the benefit of the incentives  we must hire specified numbers of employees and maintain minimum levels of fixed asset investment in costa rica 
if we do not fulfill these conditions for any reason  our incentive could lapse and our income in costa rica would be subject to taxation at higher rates  which could have a negative impact on our operating results

d b a orthoclear  inc in syracuse  new york  us district court 
the complaint alleges two causes of action against the orthoclear defendants and one cause of action against us for breach of contract 
the cause of action against us titled breach of third party benefit contract references our agreement to make invisalign treatment available to orthoclear patients  alleging that we failed to provide the promised treatment to plaintiff or any of the class members 
on june   the court granted our motion for summary judgment and dismissed us from the action 
on june   weber requested that the court enter final judgment as to align pursuant to federal rule of civil procedure b in order to certify align s dismissal for immediate appeal

table of contents requirements for the prescription of invisalign through the invisalign proficiency requirements 
in january dr 
leiszler s invisalign provider status was suspended for failing to meet the proficiency requirements 
dr 
leiszler sued on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated 
the complaint seeks a refund of the price paid to us for invisalign training 
on october   we entered into a memorandum of understanding to resolve this litigation  and on november   we executed a formal stipulation of settlement which must be approved by the court 
on december   the court granted preliminary approval of the proposed settlement 
the court has scheduled a hearing in april to determine whether to grant final approval of the proposed settlement 
under terms of the proposed settlement  class members can be reinstated to prescribe invisalign treatment under certain circumstances the reinstatement benefit 
certain class members will have the option to elect a cash remedy instead of the reinstatement benefit 
pursuant to the proposed settlement  in january  we deposited approximately million into an escrow account to pay eligible class members who elect the cash remedy  as well as legal fees and other costs 
we recorded a total litigation settlement charge of million during for our estimated liability related to this settlement 
we will continue to assess and evaluate the matter with our legal counsel and update the estimated settlement charge as appropriate as new information becomes available 
securities litigation in august  plaintiff charles wozniak filed a lawsuit against us and our chief executive officer and president  thomas m

prescott violated section b of the securities exchange act of and that mr 
prescott violated section a of the securities exchange act of specifically  the complaint alleges that during the class period we failed to disclose that we had shifted the focus of our sales force to clearing backlog  causing a significant decrease in the number of new case starts 
on november   the court appointed plumbers and pipefitters national pension fund as lead plaintiff 
the lead plaintiff filed an amended complaint on january  the amended complaint alleges that we and mr 
prescott issued a number of purportedly false and misleading statements throughout the class period concerning the patients first program  our production capacity  a purported backlog  and the focus of our sales force 
on march   we and mr 
prescott filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint 
the motion was heard by the court on july  and the court has not yet released a ruling on the motion 
we believe the lawsuit to be without merit and intend to vigorously defend ourselves 
litigating claims of the types discussed in this annual report on form k  whether or not ultimately determined in our favor or settled by us  is costly and diverts the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel from normal business operations 
any of these results from litigation could adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
from time to time  we have received  and may again receive  letters from third parties drawing our attention to their patent rights 
while we do not believe that we infringe any such rights that have been brought to our attention  there may be other more pertinent proprietary rights of which we are presently unaware

overview we design  manufacture and market the invisalign system  a proprietary method for treating malocclusion  or the misalignment of teeth 
invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear  nearly invisible  removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position 
because it does not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires  invisalign significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with metal arch wires and brackets  commonly referred to as braces 
we received the united states food and drug administration fda clearance to market invisalign in the invisalign system is regulated by the fda as a class ii medical device 
we distribute the vast majority of our products directly to our customers the orthodontist and the general practitioner dentist  or gp 
orthodontists and gps must complete an initial invisalign training course in order to begin providing the invisalign treatment solution to their patients 
the invisalign system is sold in north america  europe  asia pacific  latin america and japan 
we use a distributor model for the sale of our products in parts of the asia pacific  latin american and emea europe  middle east and africa regions 
each invisalign treatment plan is unique to the individual patient 
our invisalign full treatment consists of as many aligners as indicated by our proprietary clincheck software in order to achieve the doctors treatment goals 
our invisalign express lite are lower cost solutions for less complex orthodontic cases  such as adult relapse cases  for minor crowding and spacing  or as a pre cursor to restorative or cosmetic treatments such as veneers 
invisalign express uses up to sets of aligners and is sold in the united states and canada 
invisalign lite uses up to sets of aligners and is sold to our international customers 
invisalign teen is designed to meet the specific needs of the non adult comprehensive or teenaged treatment market particularly younger teenagers aged to years 
invisalign assist is intended to help newly trained and lower volume invisalign gps accelerate the adoption and frequency of use of invisalign into their practice 
upon completion of an invisalign or non invisalign treatment  the patient may be prescribed our traditional retainer product  or our vivera retainers  a clear aligner set designed for ongoing retention 
our goal is to establish invisalign as the standard method for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption by dental professionals by focusing on the four key objectives driving product and clinical innovation  enhancing the customer experience  increasing the effectiveness of consumer demand creation and extending invisalign brand awareness and continuing to drive international growth 
each of these four key objectives is described more fully in item i business business strategy of our annual report on form k 
as we execute on our business strategy  we will continue to deliver significant evolutions in product features and functionality  as well as customer facing systems 
in addition to the successful execution of our business strategy  a number of other factors may affect our results in and beyond  the most important of which are set forth below 
joint development with cadent 
on january   we announced an agreement to jointly develop software applications that will run on cadent itero and ioc scanners for use in invisalign treatment 
cadent is a manufacturer of d digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry 
the new applications will optimize case assessment and planning for invisalign treatment  and bring valuable digital tools chair side for invisalign providers who use cadent scanners 
a series of applications will be developed over the next couple of years and we expect the first application to be available by the end of before we can bring these new applications to market  we need to ensure interoperability with cadent scanners for use in invisalign treatment 
we have established very robust 
table of contents standards for scan quality and accuracy to ensure a specific scanning technology can successfully replace pvs impressions for invisalign treatment 
we are now in final beta tests to validate the cadent systems  and expect to announce interoperability with cadent scanners in the second quarter of accelerate product and clinical innovation 
in october  we launched invisalign g  the most significant collection of new features and innovation in our company history touching virtually every system and product 
significant improvements and enhancements were made in to all our customer facing systems 
for instance  the invisalign doctor site now consolidates all of a patient s invisalign records and treatment tasks together in one location for easy access and the clincheck software now includes drag and drop features  additional clinical tools and a more intuitive interface 
in addition  with the exception of our vivera retainers  we introduced new and expanded features across our product line 
engineered to deliver even better clinical results  the invisalign g new aligner and software features make it easier to use invisalign with more complex and challenging cases  including precision cuts designed for use on patients with class ii and class iii malocclusion  new smartforce features designed for increased predictability of certain tooth movements  and simpler  more intuitive software to streamline treatment planning and review 
elimination of the proficiency program 
in june  we introduced the invisalign product proficiency requirements proficiency program which mandated that every invisalign provider in north america submit a minimum number of case starts and complete a minimum number of continuing education ce credits 
in april  we eliminated the case start requirements and in october we eliminated the annual ce requirements  effectively terminating the proficiency program 
with the elimination of the minimum case requirements  we may experience variability in customer activity over the next several quarters as doctors  especially lower volume doctors  adjust to the elimination of the proficiency program requirements 
investments to increase manufacturing capacity 
we expect capital expenditures to increase in compared to as we invest in our manufacturing facility in juarez  mexico to add incremental capacity 
in addition  in order to meet the increased demands from expected volumes and continued international expansion  we expect to open an additional aligner fabrication site outside of north america by the end of our ability to plan  construct and equip this additional manufacturing facility is subject to significant risk and uncertainty  including delays and cost overruns 
if the opening of this facility is significantly delayed for any reason  or if demand for our product in exceeds our current expectations  we may not be able to fulfill orders timely  which may negatively impact our financial results and overall business 
number of new doctors trained 
in  we trained approximately  new doctors in north america  which included approximately doctors who had their account suspended as a result of the proficiency requirements at the end of in addition  pursuant to the terms of the proposed settlement agreement related to the leiszler class action described above in item legal proceedings in this annual report on form k  approximately  class members approximately  of whom have either never submitted a case or submitted just case prior to june could be reinstated to prescribe invisalign treatment following completion of a free hour on line course 
while we would like doctors to adopt invisalign into their practice  we do not know how many doctors will ultimately seek to be reinstated to prescribe invisalign  and of those doctors who do seek to be reinstated whether they will change their previous level of utilization 
as a result  we currently expect that the number of new and reactivated doctors trained in north america will be higher in compared to as a result of the planned international release of invisalign g second quarter  we expect to train fewer international doctors in compared to since we will scale back on training until the roll out is complete 

table of contents utilization rates 
our goal is to establish invisalign as the treatment of choice for treating malocclusion ultimately driving increased product adoption and frequency of use by dental professionals  or utilization 
our quarterly utilization rates for the previous ten quarters are as follows logo utilization rates of cases shipped divided by of doctors cases were shipped to utilization rates in the fourth quarter of for the north american ortho and gp channels decreased slightly compared to the third quarter of summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients  as the percentage of teenaged patients using invisalign increases  we expect that fourth quarter utilization rates  especially in our north america orthodontist channel will be adversely impacted 
north american gp utilization decreased from the prior quarter  which may have reflected a slowdown in patient traffic in our customer s offices during the first half of the quarter 
on a year over year basis  total worldwide utilization increased  reflecting increased use across all customer channels 
seasonal fluctuations 
seasonal fluctuations in the number of doctors in their offices and available to take appointments have affected  and are likely to continue to affect our business 
specifically  our customers often take vacation during the summer months and therefore tend to start fewer cases  especially north american gps and european doctors 
in  sequential case growth from second quarter to the third quarter in the north american ortho channel was essentially flat 
with the availability of invisalign teen  we can actively compete for a share of teen patient starts 
summer is typically the busiest season for orthodontists with practices that have a high percentage of adolescent and teenage patients 
many parents want to get their teens started in treatment before the start of the school year 
we believe that invisalign teen and the increasing percentage of teenaged patients using invisalign helped moderate the historical downward trend we have typically seen for our north american orthodontic customers during the summer months 
in the third quarter of  we saw a decline in the number of cases submitted as well as a decline in the number of submitters in our north american gp channel which is consistent with our historical trend during this quarter 
foreign exchange rates 
although the us dollar is our reporting currency  a portion of our revenues and profits are generated in foreign currencies 
revenues and profits generated by subsidiaries 
table of contents operating outside of the united states are translated into usdollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period and as a result are affected by changes in exchange rates 
we have generally accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk 
therefore  both positive and negative movements in currency exchanges rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of revenues and profits in our consolidated financial statements 
growth of international markets 
in october  we announced regulatory approval to market and sell invisalign in china and expect to begin commercial launch in the second half of while we do not expect meaningful revenue from china for several years  our focused strategy to launch invisalign in key major cities of china provides us a large growth opportunity long term 
operating expenses 
in the first quarter of  we expect operating expenses to increase reflecting additional spending in sales and marketing with increased focused on the teenage segment  commercialization activities for invisalign g  continued investment in our international expansion in both europe and china  and development costs related to the cadent joint development agreement

the release of revenue previously deferred for invisalign teen replacement aligners in the second quarter of contributed an additional million to total net revenues for in  north america revenue increased compared to due to overall case volume growth of as well as an increase in our average selling price 
higher case volume was driven primarily by the north american orthodontic channel reflecting increased penetration into the teenage orthodontic market  especially with the invisalign teen product 
additionally  the increase also reflects a significant reduction in our revenue deferral rate for teen replacement aligners and lower discounts and rebates 
our international invisalign revenue increased in compared to mainly due to growth in case volumes across all products partially offset by a mix shift towards our lower priced products  as well as unfavorable foreign exchange rates 
invisalign teen includes up to six replacement aligners which may be ordered at any time throughout treatment 
through the second quarter of  revenue for these replacement aligners was deferred based on percent of the fair value of the aligners until the replacement aligners were used or the case completed 
since the launch of invisalign teen over two years ago  we evaluated the usage experience of the replacement aligners and determined that there is sufficient historical experience to establish an estimated usage rate 
as a result  in june  we reduced deferred revenue for invisalign teen replacement aligners by million to reflect the lower estimated usage for in process cases 

table of contents other non case revenues  consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products  were higher in compared to primarily due to increased sales of our vivera and retainer products 
fiscal year compared to fiscal year total net revenues increased in compared to primarily as a result of revenue growth in our international and north american orthodontic channels and partially offset by a slight decline in north american gp revenues 
overall  north american invisalign revenues were comparable to and reflect a full year impact of product mix shifting from invisalign full towards invisalign teen and invisalign assist  both of which have higher amounts of deferred revenue than invisalign full 
additionally  north american revenues also include the full year impact of north american price increases that were effective in the beginning of the year 
the north american orthodontic channel experienced an increase in revenue and case volume primarily driven by the full year availability of invisalign teen 
north american gp revenues declined in compared to as a result of the product mix shift towards invisalign assist combined with an overall slightly lower case volume 
our international invisalign revenues grew in compared to as a result of increased invisalign full case volumes and was supplemented by a partial year impact of invisalign teen  which was launched in march this increase was offset by unfavorable exchange rates 
other revenues  consisting of training fees and sales of ancillary products  were lower in compared to primarily due to a decreased number of doctors trained year over year

through april  cost of revenues also included the cost of our third party shelter service provider in juarez  mexico 
gross margin improved in compared to primarily due to the increase in case volume which resulted in higher cost absorption and reduced cost per case 
additionally  the gross margin for was favorably impacted by the release of teen deferred revenue of million during gross margin improved slightly in compared to primarily due to an increase in case volume over our relatively fixed cost structure  continued improvement in operating efficiencies  and the cost savings from the commencement of direct fabrication of our aligners 
these efficiencies were partially offset by million of royalty costs resulting from the ormco litigation settlement

these represented effective tax rates of   and in  and  respectively 
our income tax provision is based upon our operating results for each taxable jurisdiction in which we operate and the amount of statutory tax that we incur in each jurisdiction 
we exercised significant judgment in regards to estimates of future market growth  forecasted earnings and projected taxable income  in determining the provision for income taxes  and for purposes of assessing our ability to utilize any future benefit from deferred tax assets 
at december   based on an evaluation of the available positive and negative evidence  we determined that most of our deferred tax assets would be realized with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards 
in making that determination  we considered the historical and projected pretax operating profit  excluding stock based compensation  as well as the cyclical nature of our business and the uncertainty as to the impact of new product launches 
specifically  at december   we considered the following positive evidence cumulative seven quarters of pretax operating profitability plus permanent items the then projected pretax book income for and beyond suggesting that deferred tax assets will be utilized we also considered the following negative evidence history of operating losses in and prior to cyclical nature of the business and price volatility 
table of contents we believed that the positive evidence is of sufficient quality and quantity to overcome the negative evidence and as a result  we released our tax valuation allowance of million in the fourth quarter of the remaining valuation allowance of approximately million is related to capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards as of december  because we cannot forecast sufficient future capital gains or foreign source income to realize these deferred tax assets 
these net operating loss carryforwards will result in an income tax benefit if and when we conclude it is more likely than not that the related deferred tax assets will be realized 
the california budget legislation included the ability to elect to apply a single sales factor apportionment for years beginning after january  as a result of our anticipated election of the single sales factor  we are required to re measure our deferred taxes taking into account the expected california tax rate under the elective single sales factor 
we have determined that by electing a single sales factor apportionment  our deferred tax assets decreased by approximately million net of federal benefit 
of the million tax impact  million was recorded as a discrete item in and the remaining million was recorded as a discrete item in at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which  if not used  will begin to expire in these net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code  but are expected to be fully realized 
furthermore  we have california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which  if not used  will begin to expire in at december   we had research credit carryforwards of approximately million for federal purposes and million for california state tax purposes 
if not utilized  the federal credit carryforwards will begin to expire in the california state credit can be carried forward indefinitely

net proceeds from the issuance of our common stock related to the exercise of employee stock options have historically been a significant component of our liquidity 
however  in  we began granting restricted stock units rsus which  unlike stock options  do not generate cash from exercise 
as a result  we will likely generate less cash from the proceeds of the sale of our common stock in future periods 
in addition  because rsus are taxable to the individuals when they vest  the number of shares we issue to each of our executive officers will be net of applicable withholding taxes which will be paid by us on their behalf

as of december   we had completed repurchases under the stock repurchase authorization 
there were no stock repurchases in or line of credit on december   we renegotiated and amended our existing credit facility with comerica bank 
under this revolving line of credit  we have million of available borrowings with a maturity date of december  the interest rate on borrowings will range from libor plus to depending upon the amount of cash we maintain at comerica bank 
this credit facility requires a quick ratio covenant and also requires us to maintain a minimum unrestricted cash balance of million

the lease agreement commenced on june  and will continue for an initial term of seven years and two months 
the agreement for our previous corporate headquarters in santa clara  california  expired on june  as part of the proposed terms related to the leiszler class action settlement  in january we deposited approximately million for certain class members who elect the cash remedy into an escrow account 

table of contents our contractual obligations table above excludes approximately million of non current uncertain tax benefits which are included in other long term obligations on our balance sheet as of december  we have not included this amount because we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate regarding the timing of settlements with taxing authorities  if any 
we expect capital expenditures to increase in compared to as we invest in our manufacturing facility in juarez  mexico to add incremental capacity 
in addition  in order to meet the increased demands from expected volumes and continued international expansion  we expect to open an additional aligner fabrication site outside of north america by the end of we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k item a as of december  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents combined with our existing borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
if we are unable to generate adequate operating cash flows  we may need to seek additional sources of capital through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources in order to realize our objectives and to continue our operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may need to make business decisions that could adversely affect our operating results such as modifications to our pricing policy  business structure or operations 
accordingly  the failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to revenue recognition  stock based compensation and income taxes 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is probable 
product is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
revenues are recognized from product sales  net of discounts and rebates 
service revenues related to the training of dental professionals and staff on the invisalign treatment processes are recorded when the services are completed 
we enter into arrangements that involve multiple future deliverables 
included in the price of invisalign full  invisalign teen and invisalign assist  we offer case refinement  which is a finishing tool used to adjust a patient s teeth to the desired final position 
case refinement may be elected by the dental professional at any time during treatment however it is generally ordered in the last stages of orthodontic treatment 
we use vendor specific objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the case refinement deliverable and recognize the residual revenue upon shipment 
we defer the fair value of case refinement upon shipment based on a breakage factor  which is determined by sufficient historical experience of case refinement usage 
actual usage rates could differ from the historical breakage factor requiring future adjustments to revenue 

table of contents invisalign teen is delivered in a single shipment except for six replacement aligners that are included in the price of the product and may be ordered at any time throughout treatment 
we use vendor specific objective evidence of fair value to allocate revenue to the replacement aligners and recognize the residual revenue upon initial shipment 
through the second quarter of  we deferred percent of the fair value for the six replacement aligners 
this deferred revenue was subsequently recognized as the replacement aligners were shipped or when the case was completed 
management evaluated the actual usage of replacement aligners since the launch of invisalign teen over two years ago and believes that there is sufficient historical evidence to establish an estimated usage rate 
as a result  in june  we reduced deferred revenue for invisalign teen replacement aligners by million to reflect the estimated usage for in process cases and starting in july  we began deferring the fair value of the replacement aligners based on the estimated usage rate 
we believe that this estimated usage is reasonable and appropriate because of the relative stability of the invisalign teen replacement utilization since it was first offered 
although we are not expecting any material changes  we will continue to analyze the usage of replacement aligners and may adjust the estimated usage rate as necessary 
the vivera retainer includes four shipments per year  and revenue is deferred upon the first shipment and recognized as each shipment occurs 
for invisalign assist  when the progress tracking feature is selected  aligners are shipped to the dental professional after every nine stages 
for these cases  revenue is deferred upon the first staged shipment and will be recognized upon shipment of the final staged shipment 
we estimate and record a provision for amounts of estimated losses on sales  if any  in the period such sales occur 
provisions for discounts and rebates to customers are provided for in the same period that the related product sales are recorded based upon historical discounts and rebates 
stock based compensation expense we recognize stock based compensation cost for only those shares ultimately expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  net of an estimated forfeiture rate 
we estimate the fair value of stock options using a black scholes valuation model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected term and stock price volatility 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
see note stockholders equity in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
long lived assets  including finite lived purchased intangible assets long lived assets  including intangible assets other than goodwill are amortized over their useful lives  unless these lives are determined to be indefinite 
intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization 
we perform an impairment test whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
examples of such events or circumstances include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for its business  significant negative industry or economic trends  or a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period 
impairments are recognized based on the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying value  and fair value is generally measured based on discounted cash flow analyses 
in  management decided to no longer invest in an internally developed software tool for business process management resulting in an asset impairment charge of million which was recorded in general and administrative expense in the fourth quarter of there were no asset impairments during or 
table of contents deferred tax valuation allowance we consider all available evidence  both positive and negative including historical levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of  with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  we determined that it was more likely than not the deferred tax assets would be realized 
accordingly  we released the tax valuation allowance on most of the deferred tax assets and recorded an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  as of december   with the exception of certain capital loss and foreign net operating loss carryforwards  we believed that the amount of deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet would ultimately be realized 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determine that it is more likely than not that we cannot recover our deferred tax assets

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks that could impact our financial position and results of operations 
interest rate risk changes in interest rates could impact our anticipated interest income on our cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities 
our cash equivalents and investments are fixed rate short term and long term securities 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  and as a result  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had approximately million invested in available for sale marketable securities 
an immediate increase in interest rates would not have a material adverse impact on our future operating results and cash flows 
we do not have interest bearing liabilities as of december  and therefore  we are not subject to risks from immediate interest rate decreases 
currency rate risk we operate in north america  europe  asia pacific  costa rica and japan 
as a result of our international business activities  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in foreign markets  and there is no assurance that exchange rate fluctuations will not harm our business in the future 
we sell our products in the local currency for the respective countries 
this provides some natural hedging because most of the subsidiaries operating expenses are denominated in their local currencies as discussed further below 
regardless of this natural hedging  our results of operations may be adversely impacted by the exchange rate fluctuation 
although we will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations  and  where appropriate  may use financial hedging techniques in the future to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we are not currently engaged in any financial hedging transactions 
the impact of an aggregate decline of in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar on our results of operations and financial position could be material
