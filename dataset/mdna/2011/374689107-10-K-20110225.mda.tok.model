our strategy is to position gibraltar as the low cost provider and market share leader in product areas that offer the opportunity for sales growth and margin enhancement over the long term 
we focus on operational excellence including lean initiatives throughout the company to position gibraltar as our customers low cost provider of products 
we continuously seek to improve our on time delivery  quality  and service to position gibraltar as a preferred supplier to our customers 
we also strive to develop new products  enter new markets  expand market share in the residential markets  and further penetrate domestic and international building markets to strengthen our product leadership positions 
the accelerated economic turmoil impacting the united states and the rest of the world in the second half of continued to negatively impact the key end markets we served during and as shown below  the residential construction market in the united states continued to experience significant declines in volume for the years ended december  residential housing starts the decrease in residential housing starts affected by higher unemployment and tighter consumer credit had a significant impact on the operations of our business by contributing to decreased sales volumes 
although we experienced improved order levels in march and april  the expiration of the federal tax credit for first time homebuyers  coupled with the factors noted above negatively affecting the housing market  lowered order levels in total 
similar trends were noted in the other end markets we serve  including commercial construction and related repair and remodeling activity 
additionally  commodity raw material prices for materials such as steel  aluminum  and resins  have fluctuated significantly during the past three years 
these raw material prices impact the cost of raw materials we purchase and also impact the pricing we offer to customers on sales of our products 
during the first three quarters of  a period of comparatively stronger growth  we were able to successfully manage significant increases in raw material costs 
however  commodity prices fell precipitously during the fourth quarter of and continued to fall during the first two quarters of the rapid decrease in commodity prices led to lower sales prices offered to customers and falling margins on our product sales during the fourth quarter of and the first half of commodity prices stabilized over the last six months of and most of 
table of contents and were followed by a significant increase in commodity costs during the fourth quarter of material margins were managed closely during  however  the rising cost of raw materials led to compressed margins during the last six months of the year 
in an effort to respond to these market forces  we have taken a number of steps to position the company as a low cost provider of our products 
our focus has been on achieving operational excellence through lean initiatives and the consolidation of facilities 
these efforts have resulted in the closing or consolidation of facilities since january  including six during we have also aggressively reduced operating costs to adjust to decreased sales volumes and maximize cash flows generated from operating activities 
as a result  we believe our break even point has reduced significantly from during the year ended december   we reduced our net debt level and continuously increased the company s liquidity 
we made net payments of million on debt under our revolving credit facility provided by the third amended and restated credit agreement dated july  the senior credit agreement 
as a result of these repayments  we do not have any amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and the amount available under this facility increased by million from december  to million as of december  the positive cash flow generated from operations during the past two years and from the sale of the processed metal products business allowed us to make significant repayments on our long term debt since december  during this period  we have decreased our outstanding debt by million from million as of december  to million as of december   a decrease 
additionally  the company has increased its cash on hand to million as of december  from million as of december  divestitures on february   gibraltar completed the sale of the majority of the assets of the processed metal products business 
the completion of this transaction finalized our exit from the steel processing business 
this strategic initiative began in and included the sale of our steel strapping business  the sale of the hubbell steel business  and the sale of the scm powdered metal business 
this transaction was an ongoing part of our objective to build a company with optimal operating characteristics and improve shareholder value 
we now are solely focused on the manufacture and distribution of building products where the company has historically generated its highest operating margins 
as noted above  we sold our powdered metal business  scm metal products scm in october we expect to continue evaluating our businesses to focus our resources and capital on those areas that we expect will provide the best long term strategic fit 
the divestitures of the processed metal products and powdered metal businesses as described above are properly classified as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
see note of the company s consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the divestitures described above in item of this annual report on form k 

table of contents results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth selected results of operations data in thousands and its percentages of net sales for the years ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense intangible asset impairment loss from operations interest expense equity in partnerships income loss before taxes benefit of income taxes loss from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of taxes net loss equity in partnerships income represents our proportional interest in the income of our may investment in a software development company and our steel pickling joint venture which was sold in february as well as other income 
discontinued operations represent the loss  net of income taxes  attributable to the processed metal products and bath cabinet manufacturing businesses  which we sold in february and august  respectively 
net sales decreased by million  or  to million during compared to million for the decrease in net sales from the prior year was the net result of a decrease in volume partially offset by a increase in pricing offered to customers 
the lower volume was primarily due to the slow recovery in the economy which did not generate an increase in the demand for our products used in the building markets 
as previously noted  the economic downturn continues to have a negative impact on the residential and commercial construction markets and demand of our products remains low compared to historical levels 
the higher selling prices were primarily a result of increased commodity costs for steel  aluminum  and resins 
our gross margin also decreased to during from for the decrease in gross margin was attributable to a less favorable alignment of material costs to customer selling prices during the current year compared to the previous year 
the low level of sales volume led to more pressure on pricing from competitors which in some cases limited our ability to pass along material cost increases 
this factor  in combination with rising costs for our raw materials particularly late in the year  contributed to the decline in gross margins 
additionally  we incurred a million increase in restructuring charges recognized in cost of sales during compared to the prior year 
the impact of pricing pressures  raw material commodity cost fluctuations  and restructuring charges experienced during more than offset the cost reduction initiatives we implemented over the past two years to align our cost structure to a lower level of sales volume 
we have also continued to implement lean manufacturing initiatives to further reduce our costs and improve efficiencies 
we believe these cost cutting measures will lead to much improved gross margins in future periods when the economy recovers and our sales volume increases 

table of contents selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million during compared to million for the million increase was primarily the net result of a million increase in variable incentive compensation driven by improved working capital management and the effect of the company s appreciating stock price on vested stock based awards during compared to this was partially offset by a million reduction in bad debt expense and a million reduction in salary and other payroll costs 
we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives during the past two years that included restructuring the business and staff reductions leading to the cost reduction noted above 
during and  due to changes in the estimated fair value of certain reporting units resulting from a significant decrease in sales projections  we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million during from million for we repaid all of our variable rate debt by may which decreased the amount of interest paid compared to the prior year 
we have reduced debt outstanding by million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  through debt repayments 
additionally  during the year ended december   we recognized million of interest expense to write off deferred financing costs as a result of amending our senior credit agreement in july the benefit of income taxes for was million  an effective tax rate of  compared to million  an effective tax rate of  for the effective tax rates for and were lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to the effect of non deductible permanent differences  a large portion of which related to intangible asset impairment charges that were not deductible for tax purposes 
in addition  we recognized a million valuation allowance for certain state net operating losses during which further reduced the effective tax rate 
state taxes partially offset the reduction in the effective tax rate during year ended december  compared to year ended december  the following table sets forth selected results of operations data in thousands and its percentages of net sales for the years ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expense intangible asset impairment loss income from operations interest expense equity in partnerships income loss income before taxes benefit of provision for income taxes loss income from continuing operations discontinued operations  net of taxes net loss income equity in partnerships income represents our proportional interest in the income of our steel pickling joint venture which was sold in february as well as other income 
discontinued operations represent the loss  net of income taxes  attributable to the processed metal products  powdered metal  and bath cabinet manufacturing businesses  which we sold in february  october  and august  respectively 

table of contents net sales decreased by million  or  to million during compared to million for the severe economic downturn  which greatly accelerated in the fourth quarter of  intensified during the economic conditions had negative effects on the key end markets we serve which led to the significant decline in net sales as demand for our products decreased and volume fell 
customer selling prices also decreased as a result of declines in volume and commodity costs which  in part  impact the prices agreed to with our customers 
however  the prevailing factor in the significant decrease in net sales was due to a decline in volume due to macroeconomic factors that negatively impacted our key markets such as residential housing construction as noted above 
our gross margin also decreased to during from for the decrease in gross margin was primarily the result of the significant decline in sales volume which more than offset the benefits from our cost cutting initiatives 
the precipitous decline in raw material commodity costs also led to a decline in gross margin as higher cost inventory was sold at lowered customer selling prices 
the effect of declining raw material costs was most significant during the first three quarters of selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  to million during compared to million for the million decrease was primarily a result of a million decrease in payroll related expenses resulting from staff reductions and lower incentive compensation costs  million of cost reductions from lower travel  marketing  and outside professional fees  and the impact of our other cost reduction initiatives 
despite our effort to reduce costs  our selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to during from for as a result of the reduction in net sales during compared to the prior year 
during  due to changes in the estimated fair value of certain reporting units resulting from a significant decrease in sales projections  we recognized intangible asset impairment charges of million 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million during from million for interest expense decreased due to lower average borrowings during compared to the prior year 
we reduced debt outstanding by million  or  to million as of december  from million as of december  through debt repayments 
the decrease in interest expense was partially offset by million of charges incurred to write off a portion of deferred financing costs arising from the amendment to our senior credit agreement in july and repayment of our term loan under the senior credit agreement 
the benefit of income taxes for was million  an effective tax rate of  compared with a provision for income taxes of million  an effective tax rate of  for the effective tax rate for was lower than the us federal statutory tax rate of due to the effect of non deductible permanent differences and intangible asset impairment charges  portions of which were not deductible for tax purposes 
these items were offset by state taxes which partially offset the reduction in the effective tax rate during the effective tax rate of for exceeded the statutory rate primarily due to the impact of state taxes partially offset by lower rates paid on foreign sourced income 
outlook looking ahead to  we expect modest improvement in the building markets we serve including the repair and remodel  residential construction  and non residential construction markets 
however  the extent of any sustained economic recovery in these markets is uncertain 
for the first quarter of  which is historically a period of lower order levels for our business  we anticipate net sales to be modestly favorable to the first quarter of over the long term  we believe that the fundamentals of the building markets are positive and the aggressive actions taken to streamline and improve the efficiency of our business have reduced our break even point and positioned the company to generate marked improvements in profitability when economic and market conditions return toward historical levels 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general our principal capital requirements are to fund our operations  including working capital  the purchase and funding of capital improvements to our business and facilities  and to fund acquisitions 
during the next twelve months  with the uncertainty in the general economy and the related effects on the building markets  we will continue to focus on maintaining adequate liquidity to meet our principal capital requirements 
as noted below in the cash flows section of item of this annual report on form k  we have been successful in generating positive cash flows from our operating activities to fund our capital requirements during the past two years 
we generated positive operating cash flows during these periods despite the challenging economic conditions our business faced 
in the future  we expect to continue our aggressive cost reduction initiatives and sustain strong working capital management to continue to generate positive operating cash flow 
on july   we entered into the third amended and restated credit agreement the senior credit agreement to convert our previous credit arrangement into a secured revolving credit facility that allowed us to remove many of the restrictive financial covenants contained in the second amended and restated credit agreement before it was amended and restated 
as of december   our liquidity of million consisted of million of cash and million of availability under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that availability of funds under our senior credit agreement together with the cash generated from operations should be sufficient to provide the company with the liquidity and capital resources necessary to support our principal capital requirements during the next twelve months 
our senior credit agreement provides the company with liquidity and capital resources for use by our us operations 
historically  our foreign operations have generated cash flow from operations sufficient to invest in working capital and to purchase and fund capital improvements to their businesses and facilities 
as of december   our foreign subsidiaries held million of cash 
we believe cash held by our foreign subsidiaries provides our foreign operations with the necessary liquidity to meet future obligations and allows our foreign subsidiaries to reinvest in their operations and could eventually be used to fund acquisitions that would grow our business internationally 
over the long term  we expect that future obligations  including strategic business opportunities such as acquisitions  may be financed through a number of sources  including internally available cash resources  new debt financing  the issuance of equity securities  or any combination of the above 
any potential acquisitions are evaluated on the basis of our ability to enhance our existing products  operations  or capabilities  as well as provide access to new products  markets  and customers 
these expectations are forward looking statements based upon currently available information and may change if conditions in the credit and equity markets further deteriorate or other circumstances change 
to the extent that operating cash flows are lower than current levels or sources of financing are not available or available at acceptable terms  our future liquidity may be adversely affected 
cash flows the following table sets forth selected cash flow data for the year ended december in millions cash provided by used in operating activities of continuing operations investing activities of continuing operations financing activities of continuing operations discontinued operations net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the year ended december   the company s cash flow from continuing operations totaled million 
the company s net loss from continuing operations of million was impacted by non cash 
table of contents charges including depreciation  amortization  stock compensation  and intangible asset impairments of million and million of cash generated from a net decrease in assets and liabilities offset by a million decrease in deferred tax liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities for was million 
the company s net loss from continuing operations of million was impacted by non cash charges including depreciation  amortization  stock compensation  and intangible asset impairments of million and million of cash generated from a net decrease in assets and liabilities offset by a million decrease in deferred tax liabilities 
during the year ended december   the company decreased its working capital along with other long term assets and liabilities from december  resulting in million of cash flow 
cash flows generated from the decrease in working capital and other net assets were primarily a result of an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and a decrease in inventory of million offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million 
the increases in accounts payable and accounts receivable were a result of increased manufacturing activity and sales volume during the last month of the year compared to the last month of the prior year 
inventory levels were reduced from the prior year as a result of our continued focus on lean initiatives and inventory management which have led to an increase in inventory turnover during compared to the prior year 
the accrued liabilities account increased from the prior year due to greater accruals for incentive compensation and deferred compensation plans 
in addition  the other asset balance has decreased from december  as a result of a decline in current deferred tax assets related to the timing of temporary tax differences 
cash flow provided by investing activities of continuing operations during was million consisting of million of cash flow generated from the sale of our processed metal products business offset by capital expenditures of million and a million investment in a software company

the senior credit agreement provides for a revolving credit facility and letters of credit in an aggregate amount that does not exceed the lesser of i million or ii a borrowing base determined by reference to the trade receivables  inventories  and property  plant  and equipment of the company s significant domestic subsidiaries 
the senior credit agreement also provided a term loan originally aggregating million which was subsequently repaid in full during the revolving credit facility is committed through august  borrowings on the revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable interest rate based upon the london interbank offered rate libor  with a libor floor of plus  or at the company s option  an alternate base rate 
the revolving credit facility also carries an annual facility fee of on the entire facility  whether drawn or undrawn  and fees on outstanding letters of credit which are payable quarterly 
as of december   we had million of availability under the revolving credit facility 

table of contents during the year ended december   we made net payments of million on the revolving credit facility and have not had any borrowings under the senior credit agreement since may  we had outstanding letters of credit of million as of december  the company s million of senior subordinated notes notes were issued in december at a discount to yield 
provisions of the notes include  without limitation  restrictions on indebtedness  liens  and distributions from restricted subsidiaries  asset sales  affiliate transactions  dividends  and other restricted payments 
dividend payments are subject to annual limits of per share and million 
the notes are currently redeemable at the option of the company  in whole or in part  at the redemption price as defined in the senior subordinated notes indenture  which declines annually from to on and after december  in the event of a change in control as defined in the senior subordinated notes indenture  each holder of the notes may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of such holder s notes at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount thereof

the notes are guaranteed by each of our significant domestic subsidiaries 
on a trailing four quarter basis  the senior credit agreement includes a single financial covenant that requires the company to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio as defined in the senior credit agreement of to at the end of each quarter 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio covenant 
management expects to be in compliance with the fixed charge ratio throughout the senior credit agreement contains other provisions and events of default that are customary for similar agreements and may limit the company s ability to take various actions 
the senior subordinated notes indenture also contains provisions that limit additional borrowings based on the company s consolidated interest coverage ratio 
off balance sheet arrangements the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements

excludes liabilities for uncertain tax positions of million 
we have not included the liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we cannot make reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make decisions based upon estimates  assumptions  and factors it considers relevant to the circumstances 
such decisions include the selection of applicable principles and the use of judgment in their application  the results of which could differ from those anticipated 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the company s consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
our most critical accounting policies include valuation of accounts receivable  which impacts selling  general  and administrative expense  valuation of inventory  which impacts cost of sales and gross margin  the assessment of recoverability of depreciable and amortizable long lived assets  which impacts write offs of intangible assets and other long lived assets  the assessment of recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  which impacts write offs of goodwill and intangible assets  and accounting for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities  which impacts the provision for income taxes 
management reviews the estimates  including the allowance for doubtful accounts and inventory reserves  on a regular basis and makes adjustments based on historical experience  current conditions  and future expectations 
management believes these estimates are reasonable  but actual results could differ from these estimates 
valuation of accounts receivable 
our accounts receivable represent those amounts that have been billed to our customers but not yet collected 
as of december  and  allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million were recorded  respectively  or of gross accounts receivable for both periods 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the portion of those accounts receivable that we believe are potentially uncollectible based on various factors  including experience  creditworthiness of customers  and current market and economic conditions 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing of costs recognized 
valuation of inventories 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we determine the cost basis of our inventory on a first in first out basis using a standard cost methodology that approximates actual cost 
on a regular basis  we calculate an estimated market value of our inventory  considered to be the prevailing selling price for the inventory less the cost to complete and sell the product 
we compare the current carrying value of our inventory to the estimated market value to determine whether a reserve to value inventory at the lower of cost or market is necessary 
we recorded insignificant charges during the years ended december    and to value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 

table of contents we regularly review inventory on hand and record provisions for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory based on historical and current sales trends 
we recorded reserves for excess  obsolete  and slow moving inventory of million and million as of december  and  respectively  or of gross inventories for both periods 
changes in product demand and our customer base may affect the value of inventory on hand  which may require higher provisions for obsolete inventory 
impairment of depreciable and amortizable long lived assets we test long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable and exceed their fair market value 
the following summarizes the value of long lived assets subject to impairment testing when events or circumstances indicate potential impairment as of december  in millions balance as of december  property  plant  and equipment  net acquired intangibles with useful lives other assets impairment exists if the carrying amount of the asset in question exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 
the impairment loss would be measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeds its fair value as determined by discounted cash flow method  an independent market appraisal of the asset  or another acceptable valuation technique 
we recognized impairment charges for property  plant  and equipment as a result of restructuring activities during the years ended december  and and amortizable intangible assets as a result of our impairment testing 
no depreciable or amortizable long lived assets were impaired during the year ended december  goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset balances of million and million as of december   respectively  are subject to impairment testing 
we test goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on an annual basis as of october and at interim dates when indicators of impairment are present 
indicators of impairment could include a significant long term adverse change in business climate  poor indicators of operating performance  or a sale or disposition of significant portion of a reporting unit 
during  we concluded that no new indicators of impairment existed at interim dates and did not perform any interim impairment tests related to goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
we tested goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment during the fourth quarter of at the annual test date 
as a result of the october  impairment test  the company recognized an intangible asset impairment charge of million for the year ended december  compared to a million intangible asset impairment charge for the year ended december  in addition the annual impairment test  goodwill and other indefinite lived assets were tested for impairment at two interim dates during march and june we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level 
we identify our reporting units by assessing whether the components of our operating segments constitute businesses for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of those components 
as of the october  impairment test  we identified reporting units with goodwill compared to reporting units with goodwill in the goodwill impairment tests 
the number of reporting units was decreased when we consolidated the manufacturing and management of one reporting unit into another reporting unit during the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit s fair value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 

table of contents the following table sets forth the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit tested for goodwill impairment prior to any impairment charges  the percentage by which the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value  any impairment losses recognized  and the remaining goodwill allocated to each reporting unit after any impairment charges as of the october  goodwill impairment test in thousands percentage by goodwill allocated which estimated goodwill allocated to reporting unit fair value goodwill to reporting unit before impairment exceeds carrying impairment after impairment reporting unit charges value charges charges  n a    n a    n a  total the company s october  impairment analysis included significant assumptions in both steps one and two of the impairment test 
to estimate the fair value of the reporting units as a part of step one of the impairment test  the company used two valuation techniques an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach included a discounted cash flow model relying on significant assumptions consisting of revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts  terminal value  and the weighted average cost of capital wacc used to discount future cash flows 
the market approach consisted of applying an earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiple to the forecasted ebitda to be generated in and the market approach also relied on significant assumptions consisting of revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts and the ebitda multiple selected from an analysis of peer companies 
the following table sets forth the compound annual revenue growth rate for the five year period used to forecast cash flows and the average operating margin for the forecasted periods compared to actual operating margins generated over the long term which we estimated to be the six year and ten month period ended october  actual operating compound annual margins for the revenue growth rate operating margin period between for forecasted for forecasted january  and reporting unit annual periods periods october  operating margins presented exclude restructuring charges incurred by each reporting unit 

table of contents the operating margins presented only include operating results generated since the date the reporting units were acquired by gibraltar 
this reporting unit made an incremental acquisition in including a product line with significantly higher margins than the existing product lines it offers 
additionally  this reporting unit s operations were restructured in as a result  we believe forecasted operating margins will exceed prior results 
this reporting unit s operations have been restructured during   and to increase the efficiency and reduce the cost of production 
as a result  we believe forecasted operating margins will exceed prior results 
this reporting unit s operations were restructured in the reporting unit has since generated operating margins approaching 
we analyzed third party forecasts of housing starts and other macroeconomic indicators that impact the company s reporting units to provide a reasonable estimate of revenue growth in future periods 
our analysis of third party forecasts noted that housing starts were projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of from to therefore  we considered these forecasts in developing each reporting unit s growth rates over the next five years depending on the level of correlation between housing starts and net sales for each reporting unit 
the correlation between housing starts and net sales was based on an analysis of historical housing starts and our historical revenue 
we concluded that this approach provided a reasonable estimate of long term revenue growth and cash flows for our reporting units 
the operating margins we used to estimate future cash flows were consistent with long term margins generated by the reporting units while they have been owned and operated by the company as shown in the table above 
the reporting units where forecasted operating margins exceed long term operating margins generated by the reporting unit were for reporting units that were recently acquired and  therefore  the long term operating margins were more significantly impacted by the economic turmoil that began in the fourth quarter of additionally  the company took strategic actions to consolidate facilities  reduce costs  and restructure these business units to become more profitable as the economy recovers 
these actions led to increased costs and lower operating margins in the short term 
based on our understanding of these reporting units and the actions taken by management to restructure the businesses for improved growth and profitability  we concluded that the long term cash flows forecasted for all of the company s reporting units were reasonable 
in addition to revenue growth and operating margin forecasts  the discounted cash flow model used to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit also uses assumptions for the amount of working capital needed to support each business unit 
we forecasted modest improvement in working capital management for future periods at each reporting unit based on past performance 
the company experienced a significant reduction in days of working capital from days for the year ended december  to days for the year ended december  and has further reduced days of working capital to days for the year ended december  we have been able to significantly improve our working capital management through lean initiatives  efficiency improvements  and facility consolidations 
we believe continued improvement in our ability to manage working capital will allow us to increase the cash flow generated from each reporting unit 
the terminal value of each reporting unit was based on a projected terminal year of forecasted cash flows in our discounted cash flow model 
we made an assumption that cash flows would grow each year thereafter based on our approximation of gross domestic product growth in the north american and european markets served by the company 
this assumption was based on a third party forecast of future economic growth over the long term 
the discounted cash flow model uses the wacc to discount cash flows in the forecasted period and to discount the terminal value to present value 
to determine the wacc  we used a standard valuation method  the capital asset pricing model  based on readily available and current market data of peer companies considered market participants 
acknowledging the risk inherent in the reporting units ability to achieve the long term forecasted cash flows  in applying the income approach we increased the wacc of each reporting unit based upon each reporting unit s past operating performance and their relative ability to achieve the 
table of contents forecasted cash flows 
as a result of these analyses  we assigned a wacc between and for each reporting unit 
the ebitda multiple used in the market approach to determine the fair value of each reporting unit was applied to the forecasted ebitda to be generated during and the market approach relies on significant assumptions consisting of revenue growth rates and profit margins based on internal forecasts and the ebitda multiple selected from an analysis of peer companies considered market participants 
the revenue growth rates and profit margins used in the market approach were the same projections used in the discounted cash flows model as described above 
the ebitda multiples were established by analyzing each peer companies total invested capital in proportion to ebitda derived from each peer companies most recently reported earnings 
similar to the wacc analysis  we assessed the risk of each reporting unit achieving its forecasts with consideration given to how each reporting unit has performed historically compared to forecasts 
as a result of these analyses  we assigned an ebitda multiple between and for ebitda forecasts and and for ebitda forecasts 
as noted above  we used two valuation techniques that are commonly accepted in the valuation community to estimate a fair value for each reporting unit 
the estimated fair value for each reporting unit was calculated using a weighted average between the calculated amounts determined under the income approach and the market approach 
we weighted the income approach more heavily as the technique uses a long term approach that considers the expected operating profit of each reporting unit during periods where housing starts and other macroeconomic indicators are nearer historical averages 
the market approach values the reporting units using and ebitda values which were forecasted using estimated housing starts of  and  respectively 
housing starts have historically approximated million each year 
we believe the income approach considers the expected recovery in the residential building market better than the market approach 
therefore  we concluded that the income approach more accurately estimated the fair value of the reporting units as it considers earnings potential during a longer term and does not use the short term perspective used by the market approach 
accordingly  we concluded that the market participants who execute transactions to sell or buy a business in the current economic environment would place greater emphasis on the income approach 
the following table sets forth the company s estimated fair value and carrying value for each reporting unit as of october  in thousands carrying value after reporting unit estimated fair value impairment charges corporate total net debt equity net book value 
table of contents the corporate category includes unallocated corporate cash out flows 
unallocated corporate cash out flows include executive compensation and other administrative costs 
the company has grown substantially through acquisitions and our strategy is to allow business unit management to operate the business units autonomous of corporate management 
for example  each business unit has its own accounting  marketing  purchasing  information technology  and executive functions 
as a result  we believe a market participant would not consider unallocated corporate cash flows when valuing each reporting unit and these cash flows have been properly excluded from the valuation of the reporting units 
step two of the impairment analysis involved estimating the implied fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of each reporting unit to its assets and liabilities other than goodwill and comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying value 
the step two analyses relied on a number of significant assumptions to determine the fair value of inventory  property  plant  and equipment  and intangible assets for each reporting unit 
the significant assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of inventory included the determination of the market value of raw materials  the estimated costs to complete work in process inventory  and the estimated selling prices for finished goods inventories 
the assumptions we employed in determining the fair values of these inventory components were based primarily on historical gross margins and selling costs generated by the reporting units and we believe this to be a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of inventories as of the impairment test date 
the fair value of property  plant  and equipment was determined using standard valuation methodologies including market and cost approaches 
these valuations were based on market data gathered for similar assets sold in the markets in which the reporting units property  plant  and equipment are located and based on the highest and best use from a market participant perspective 
third party appraisals were commissioned where appropriate to assist in estimating the fair value of the reporting units property  plant  and equipment 
the overall condition and age of the assets  current replacement cost  current market demand for the assets  and other factors were considered in the determination of the fair value of the assets 
the fair value of intangible assets was also determined using standard valuation methodologies including the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method 
these methods primarily employed the use of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the applicable intangible assets 
the future cash flows used to determine the fair vales of these intangible assets were derived from step one of the goodwill impairment analysis as described above 
the discount rate used in the valuation of intangible assets was derived from the wacc used in step one of the goodwill impairment analysis 
based on the analysis described above  we concluded the assumptions underlying step two of our impairment analysis were reasonable and appropriate 
in addition to the analyses described above  we performed a reconciliation of the total estimated fair values of the reporting units to our market capitalization as of october  to support the reasonableness of the fair value estimates used in our october  impairment analysis 
the following calculation provides this reconciliation and the resulting control premium determined as of our october  impairment analysis in thousands fair value per the october  estimated market impairment analysis capitalization estimated fair value of reporting units less net debt as of october  shares outstanding as of october  average stock price from october  to november  value of equity control premium despite the difference between our net book value and the estimated fair value of equity  all reporting units with goodwill had fair values in excess of their carrying value 
the difference between our net book value and the estimated fair value of equity is the result of the negative future cash flows associated with our unallocated corporate net assets net of reporting units without goodwill allocated to them described above 

table of contents although the company s book value of equity exceeds its market capitalization  we deemed the control premium as of the october  impairment analysis to be reasonable based upon recent comparable transactions to acquire the control of similar businesses in our industry 
accordingly  we concluded the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was reasonably estimated 
we test our intangible assets for impairment by comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset  determined using a discounted cash flow model  with its carrying amount 
an impairment loss would be recognized for the carrying amount in excess of its fair value 
we recognized impairment charges for indefinite lived intangible assets as a result of our october  and impairment tests 
the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets are consistent with the assumptions employed in the determination of the fair values of our reporting units 
accounting for income taxes and deferred tax assets and liabilities significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance 
our effective tax rates differ from the statutory rate due to the impact of permanent differences between income or loss reported for financial statement purposes and tax purposes  provisions for uncertain tax positions  state taxes  and income generated by international operations 
our effective tax rate was   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and vice versa 
changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof may also adversely affect our future effective tax rate 
in addition  we are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based upon the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities as measured by the enacted tax rates that will be in effect when these differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided if based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
during the year ended december   deferred income tax liabilities decreased primarily as a result of the tax effect of the million intangible asset impairment charge along with a decrease in the difference between depreciation recognized on property  plant  and equipment for tax purposes 
deferred income tax assets increased primarily due to additional equity compensation recognized during regarding deferred income tax assets  we maintained valuation allowances of million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize these assets  primarily consisting of state net operating losses and other deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowances are based on estimates of taxable income in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate further or future operating results do not meet expectations  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the gross deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
it is the company s policy to record estimated interest and penalties to the tax authorities as income tax expense and tax credits as a reduction in income tax expense 
during the years ended december    and  we recognized million  million  and million of interest net of federal tax benefit and penalties  respectively 
the company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate 
table of contents resolution

due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid

in addition  the company is exposed to market risk  primarily related to its long term debt 
to manage interest rate risk  the company uses both fixed and variable interest rate debt 
during  the company repaid all amounts outstanding under the third amended and restated credit agreement dated july  the senior credit agreement 
as a result  fixed rate debt consisting of the company s senior subordinated notes is the only significant debt that remains outstanding at december  prior to  the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement that converted a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the interest rate swap agreement expired during and all amounts due under the agreement were settled prior to december  the company believes it has limited its exposure to interest rate risk as a result of repaying substantially all variable rate debt and the long term nature of its fixed rate debt 
however  the company will continue to monitor changes in its debt levels and access to capital ensuring interest rate risk is appropriately managed 
the following table summarizes the principal cash flows and related interest rates of the company s long term debt at december  by expected maturity dates 
the weighted average interest rates are based on the actual rates that existed at december  the variable rate debt consists primarily of the revolving credit facility under the senior credit agreement  of which no amounts are outstanding as of december   and other debt
