item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data  and our financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under risk factors  forward looking statements and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we have three reportable segments with continuing operations through the year ended december  consumer products and services  online brand protection and bail bonds industry solutions 
our consumer products and services segment includes our consumer protection and other consumer products and services 
this segment consists of identity theft management tools  services from our relationship with a third party that administers referrals for identity theft to major banking institutions and breach response services  membership product offerings and other subscription based services such as life and accidental death insurance 
our online brand protection segment includes corporate brand protection provided by net enforcers 
our bail bonds industry solutions segment includes the software management solutions for the bail bond industry provided by captira analytical 
in addition  until the sale of screening international on july   we had a fourth reportable segment  our background screening segment  which included the personnel and vendor background screening services provided by screening international 
consumer products and services we offer consumers a variety of consumer protection services and other consumer products and services primarily on a subscription basis 
our services help consumers protect themselves against identity theft or fraud and understand and monitor their credit profiles and other personal information 
through our subsidiary  intersections insurance services  we offer a portfolio of services to include consumer discounts on healthcare  home  and auto related expenses  access to professional financial and legal information  and life  accidental death and disability insurance products 
our consumer services are offered through relationships with clients  including many of the largest financial institutions in the united states and canada  and clients in other industries 
our products and services are marketed to customers of our clients  and often are branded and tailored to meet our clients specifications 
our clients are principally credit card  direct deposit or mortgage issuing financial institutions  including many of the largest financial institutions in the united states and canada 
with certain of our financial institution clients  we have broadened our marketing efforts to access demand deposit accounts 
our financial institution clients currently account for the majority of our existing subscriber base 
we also are continuing to augment our client base through relationships with insurance companies  mortgage companies  brokerage companies  associations  travel companies  retail companies  web and technology companies and other service providers with significant market presence and brand loyalty 
with our clients  our services are marketed to potential subscribers through a variety of marketing channels  including direct mail  outbound telemarketing  inbound telemarketing  inbound customer service and account activation calls  email  mass media and the internet 
our marketing arrangements with our clients sometimes call for us to fund and manage marketing activity 
the mix between our company funded and client funded marketing programs varies from year to year based upon our and our clients strategies 
in  we continued our efforts to market our consumer products and services directly to consumers 
we conduct our consumer direct marketing primarily through the internet and broadcast media 
we also may market through other channels  including direct mail  outbound telemarketing  inbound telemarketing and email 
we expect to continue our investment in marketing in in our direct to consumer business 
our client arrangements are distinguished from one another by the allocation between us and the client of the economic risk and reward of the marketing campaigns 
the general characteristics of each arrangement are described below  although the arrangements with particular clients may contain unique characteristics direct marketing arrangements under direct marketing arrangements  we bear most of the new subscriber marketing costs and pay our client a commission for revenue derived from subscribers 
these commissions could be payable upfront in a lump sum on a per subscriber basis for the subscriber s enrollment  periodically over the life of a subscriber  or through a combination of both 
these arrangements generally result in negative cash flow over the first several months after a program is launched due to the upfront nature of the marketing investments 
in some arrangements  we pay the client a service fee for access to the client s customers or billing of the subscribers by the client  and we may reimburse the client for certain of its out of pocket marketing costs incurred in obtaining the subscriber 
indirect marketing arrangements under indirect marketing arrangements  our client bears the marketing expense and pays us a service fee or percentage of the revenue 
because the subscriber acquisition cost is borne by our client under these arrangements  our revenue per subscriber is typically lower than that under direct marketing arrangements 
indirect marketing arrangements generally provide positive cash flow earlier than direct arrangements and the ability to obtain subscribers and utilize marketing channels that the clients otherwise may not make available 
shared marketing arrangements under shared marketing arrangements  marketing expenses are shared by us and the client in various proportions  and we may pay a commission to or receive a service fee from the client 
revenue generally is split relative to the investment made by our client and us 
the classification of a client relationship as direct  indirect or shared is based on whether we or the client pay the marketing expenses 
our accounting policies for revenue recognition  however  are not based on the classification of a client arrangement as direct  indirect or shared 
we look to the specific client arrangement to determine the appropriate revenue recognition policy  as discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our typical contracts for direct marketing arrangements  and some indirect and shared marketing arrangements  provide that  after termination of the contract  we may continue to provide our services to existing subscribers  for periods ranging from two years to no specific termination period  under the economic arrangements that existed at the time of termination 
under certain of our agreements  however  including most indirect marketing arrangements and some shared marketing arrangements  the clients may require us to cease providing services under existing subscriptions 
clients under some contracts may also require us to cease providing services to their customers under existing subscriptions if the contract is terminated for material breach by us 
as shown in the following table  the number of subscribers from our direct and shared marketing arrangements have decreased over the past year as of december  in thousands indirect marketing arrangements direct and shared marketing arrangements total subscribers through our increased direct marketing efforts over the last few years  subscribers in our consumer products and services segment from direct marketing arrangements were in  in and in the number of cancellations within the first days as a percentage of new subscribers was in  in and in the increase in cancellation in is due to the higher rate of new additions in the fourth quarter of and the first half of the increase in cancellations in was driven by sales mix and sales from a partner  who is not a financial institution  which had higher than expected rate of disputed billing transactions 
in the three months ended december   we ceased sales with that partner 
we analyze subscriber cancellations during the first days because we believe this time period affords the subscriber the opportunity to evaluate the service 
the number of cancellations after the first days  which are measured as a percentage of the number of subscribers at the beginning of the year plus new subscribers during the year less cancellations within the first days  was in  in and in the total number of cancellations during the year as a percentage of the beginning of the year subscribers plus new subscriber additions  was in  in  and in the higher percentages in are primarily due to a loss of approximately thousand subscribers from the termination of the wholesale relationship with discover in conversely  our retention rates  calculated by taking subscribers at the end of the year divided by subscribers at the beginning of the year plus additions for the year  was in  in and in the lower retention rate in resulted primarily from the termination of the wholesale relationship with discover 
revenue from subscribers obtained through our largest clients for the years ended december   and as a percentage of total revenue  and the principal contract arrangements with those clients  were as follows percentage of revenue for the years ended december  client relationship bank of america includes mbna shared direct marketing citibank direct marketing citibank indirect marketing capital one indirect marketing we regularly re negotiate and adjust the products  retail pricing  pricing of our contracts  and marketing opportunities with our top revenue producing clients 
we expect some of these changes to affect the sales volumes  sales mix and profitability of our client marketing programs 
online brand protection through our subsidiary  net enforcers  we provide online brand protection services including online channel monitoring  auction monitoring  forum  blog and newsgroup monitoring and other services 
net enforcers services include the use of technology and operations staff to search the internet for instances of our clients brands and or specific products  categorize each instance as potentially threatening to our clients based upon client provided criteria  and report our findings back to our clients 
net enforcers also offers additional value added services to assist our clients to take actions to remediate perceived threats detected online 
net enforcers services are typically priced as monthly subscriptions for a defined set of monitoring services  as well as per transaction charges for value added communications services 
prices for our services vary based upon the specific configuration of services purchased by each client and range from several hundred dollars per month to tens of thousands of dollars per month 
bail bonds industry solutions through our subsidiary  captira analytical  we provide automated service solutions for the bail bonds industry 
these services include accounting  reporting  and decision making tools which allow bail bondsmen  general agents and sureties to run their offices more efficiently  to exercise greater operational and financial control over their businesses  and to make better underwriting decisions 
we believe captira analytical s services are the only fully integrated suite of bail bonds management applications of comparable scope available in the marketplace today 
captira analytical s services are sold to retail bail bondsman on a per seat license basis plus additional one time or recurring charges for various optional services 
additionally  captira analytical has developed a suite of services for bail bonds insurance companies  general agents and sureties which are sold on either a transactional or recurring revenue basis 
critical accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates and assumptions that can have a significant impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions  judgments or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our consolidated results of operations 
for further information on our critical and other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue on identity theft and credit management services  accidental death insurance and other membership products and other monthly subscription products 
our products and services are offered to consumers principally on a monthly subscription basis 
subscription fees are generally billed directly to the subscriber s credit card  mortgage bill or demand deposit accounts 
the prices to subscribers of various configurations of our products and services range generally from to per month 
as a means of allowing customers to become familiar with our services  we sometimes offer free trial or guaranteed refund periods 
no revenues are recognized until applicable trial periods are completed 
identity theft and credit management services we recognize revenue from our services when a persuasive evidence of arrangement exists as we maintain signed contracts with all of our large financial institution customers and paper and electronic confirmations with individual purchases  b delivery has occurred once the product is transmitted over the internet  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed as sales are generally based on contract or list prices and payments from large financial institutions are collected within days with no significant write offs  and d collectability is reasonably assured as individual customers pay by credit card which has limited our risk of non collection 
revenue for monthly subscriptions is recognized in the month the subscription fee is earned 
for subscriptions with refund provisions whereby only the prorated subscription fee is refunded upon cancellation by the subscriber  deferred subscription fees are recorded when billed and amortized as subscription fee revenue on a straight line basis over the subscription period  generally one year 
we also generate revenue through a collaborative arrangement which involves joint marketing and servicing activities 
we recognize our share of revenues and expenses from this arrangement 
revenue for annual subscription fees must be deferred if the subscriber has the right to cancel the service 
annual subscriptions include subscribers with full refund provisions at any time during the subscription period and pro rata refund provisions 
revenue related to annual subscription with full refund provisions is recognized on the expiration of these refund provisions 
revenue related to annual subscribers with pro rata provisions is recognized based on a pro rata share of revenue earned 
an allowance for discretionary subscription refunds is established based on our actual experience 
we also provide services for which certain financial institution clients are the primary obligors directly to their customers 
revenue from these arrangements is recognized when earned  which is at the time we provide the service  generally on a monthly basis 
we record revenue on a gross basis in the amount that we bill the subscriber when our arrangements with financial institution clients provide for us to serve as the primary obligor in the transaction  we have latitude in establishing price and we bear the risk of physical loss of inventory and credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
we record revenue in the amount that we bill our financial institution clients  and not the amount billed to their customers  when our financial institution client is the primary obligor  establishes price to the customer and bears the credit risk 
accidental death insurance and other membership products we recognize revenue from our services when a persuasive evidence of arrangement exists as we maintain paper and electronic confirmations with individual purchases  b delivery has occurred at the completion of a product trial period  c the seller s price to the buyer is fixed as the price of the product is agreed to by the customer as a condition of the sales transaction which established the sales arrangement  and d collectability is reasonably assured as evidenced by our collection of revenue through the monthly mortgage payments of our customers or through checking account debits to our customers accounts 
revenues from insurance contracts are recognized when earned 
marketing of our insurance products generally involves a trial period during which time the product is made available at no cost to the customer 
no revenues are recognized until applicable trial periods are completed 
for insurance products  we record revenue on a net basis as we perform as an agent or broker for the insurance products without assuming the risks of ownership of the insurance products 
for membership products  we record revenue on a gross basis as we serve as the primary obligor in the transactions  have latitude in establishing price and bear credit risk for the amount billed to the subscriber 
we participate in agency relationships with insurance carriers that underwrite insurance products offered by us 
accordingly  insurance premiums collected from customers and remitted to insurance carriers are excluded from our revenues and operating expenses 
insurance premiums collected but not remitted to insurance carriers as of december  and  totaled million and million  respectively  and are included in accrued expenses and other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
other monthly subscription products we generate revenue from other types of subscription based products provided from our online brand protection and bail bonds industry solutions segments 
we recognize revenue from online brand protection and brand monitoring services  offered by net enforcers  on a monthly basis and from providing management service solutions  offered by captira analytical  on a monthly subscription basis 
deferred subscription solicitation and advertising our deferred subscription solicitation costs consist of subscription acquisition costs  including telemarketing  web based marketing expenses and direct mail such as printing and postage 
we expense advertising costs the first time advertising takes place  except for direct response marketing costs 
telemarketing  web based marketing and direct mail expenses are direct response marketing costs  which are amortized on a cost pool basis over the period during which the future benefits are expected to be received  but no more than months 
the recoverability of amounts capitalized as deferred subscription solicitation costs are evaluated at each balance sheet date by comparing the carrying amounts of such assets on a cost pool basis to the probable remaining future benefit expected to result directly from such advertising costs 
probable remaining future benefit is estimated based upon historical subscriber patterns  and represents net revenues less costs to earn those revenues 
in estimating probable future benefit on a per subscriber basis we deduct our contractual cost to service that subscriber from the known sales price 
we then apply the future benefit on a per subscriber basis to the number of subscribers expected to be retained in the future to arrive at the total probable future benefit 
in estimating the number of subscribers we will retain ie  factoring in expected cancellations  we utilize historical subscriber patterns maintained by us that show attrition rates by client  product and marketing channel 
the total probable future benefit is then compared to the costs of a given marketing campaign ie  cost pools  and if the probable future benefit exceeds the cost pool  the amount is considered to be recoverable 
if direct response advertising costs were to exceed the estimated probable remaining future benefit  an adjustment would be made to the deferred subscription costs to the extent of any shortfall 
commission costs commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full refund provisions and monthly subscriptions are expensed when incurred  unless we are entitled to a refund of the commissions from our client 
if annual subscriptions are cancelled prior to their initial terms  we are generally entitled to a full refund of the previously paid commission for those annual subscriptions with a full refund provision and a pro rata refund  equal to the unused portion of the subscription  for those annual subscriptions with a pro rata refund provision 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with full commission refund provisions are deferred until the earlier of expiration of the refund privileges or cancellation 
once the refund privileges have expired  the commission costs are recognized ratably in the same pattern that the related revenue is recognized 
commissions that relate to annual subscriptions with pro rata refund provisions are deferred and charged to operations as the corresponding revenue is recognized 
if a subscription is cancelled  upon receipt of the refunded commission from our client  we record a reduction to the deferred commission 
we have prepaid commission agreements with some of our clients 
under these agreements  we pay a commission on new subscribers in lieu of or a reduction in future commission payments 
we amortize these prepaid commissions  on an accelerated basis  over a period of time not to exceed three years  which is the average expected life of customers 
the short term portion of the prepaid commissions is shown in deferred subscription solicitation costs in our consolidated balance sheet 
the long term portion of the prepaid commissions is shown in other assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
amortization is included in commission expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill  identifiable intangibles and other long lived assets we record  as goodwill  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired in purchase transactions 
we review our goodwill for impairment annually  as of october  or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist  and follow the two step process 
goodwill has been assigned to our reporting units for purposes of impairment testing 
as of december   goodwill of million resides in our consumer products and services reporting unit and there is no goodwill remaining in our other reporting units 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indicator of impairment has occurred 
such indicators may include  among others a a significant decline in our expected future cash flows  b a sustained  significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization  c a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  d unanticipated competition  e the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and f slower growth rates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
we estimate fair value using the best information available  using a combined income discounted cash flow valuation model and market based approach 
the market approach measures the value of an entity through an analysis of recent sales or offerings of comparable companies 
the income approach measures the value of the reporting units by the present values of its economic benefits 
these benefits can include revenue and cost savings 
value indications are developed by discounting expected cash flows to their present value at a rate of return that incorporates the risk free rate for use of funds  trends within the industry  and risks associated with particular investments of similar type and quality as of the valuation date 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units is dependent on several significant assumptions  including our earnings projections  and cost of capital discount rate 
the projections use management s best estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period including business plans  growth rates in sales  costs  estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures and changes in future working capital requirements 
there are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and management s judgment in applying each to the analysis of the recoverability of goodwill 
we estimate fair value giving consideration to both the income and market approaches 
consideration is given to the line of business and operating performance of the entities being valued relative to those of actual transactions  potentially subject to corresponding economic  environmental  and political factors considered to be reasonable investment alternatives 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired and the second step of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  then the second step of the goodwill impairment test must be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its goodwill carrying value to measure the amount of impairment charge  if any 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
in other words  the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of that reporting unit was the purchase price paid 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
we review long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  property and equipment and other long term assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
significant judgments in this area involve determining whether a triggering event has occurred and determining the future cash flows for assets involved 
in conducting our analysis  we compared the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated from the long lived assets to the related net book values 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the net book value  the long lived assets are considered not to be impaired 
if the net book value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment charge is measured and recognized 
an impairment charge is measured as the difference between the net book value and the fair value of the long lived assets 
fair value is estimated by discounting the future cash flows associated with these assets 
intangible assets subject to amortization may include trademarks and customer  marketing and technology related intangibles 
such intangible assets  excluding customer related intangibles  are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which are generally three to ten years 
customer related intangible assets are amortized on either a straight line or accelerated basis  dependent upon the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or otherwise used up 
share based compensation we currently have three equity incentive plans  the and stock option plans and the stock incentive plan which provide us with the opportunity to compensate selected employees with stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units 
a stock option entitles the recipient to purchase shares of common stock from us at the specified exercise price 
restricted stock and restricted stock units rsus entitle the recipient to obtain stock or stock units  
par value  which vest over a set period of time 
rsus are granted at no cost to the employee and employees do not need to pay an exercise price to obtain the underlying common stock 
all grants or awards made under the plans are governed by written agreements between us and the participants 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value all options and the straight line method to amortize this fair value as compensation cost over the requisite service period 
the fair value of each option granted has been estimated as of the date of grant with the following weighted average assumptions expected dividend yield expected volatility weighted average risk free interest rate weighted average expected life of options years years years expected dividend yield 
the black scholes valuation model requires an expected dividend yield as an input 
as further described in note to our consolidated financial statements  prior to september  we had not issued dividends and  therefore  the dividend yield used in grants prior to september  was zero 
subsequent to september  we paid quarterly cash dividends of per share on our common stock 
we had one grant  of five thousand options  subsequent to september  and we applied a dividend yield 
for future grants  we will apply a dividend yield based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
expected volatility 
the expected volatility of the options granted was estimated based upon our historical share price volatility as well as the average volatility of comparable public companies 
we will continue to review our estimate in the future 
risk free interest rate 
the yield on actively traded non inflation indexed us treasury notes was used to extrapolate an average risk free interest rate based on the expected term of the underlying grants 
expected term 
the expected term of options granted during the years ended december   and was determined under the simplified calculation vesting term original contractual term 
for the majority of grants valued during these years ended  the options had graded vesting over years equal vesting of options annually and the contractual term was years 
in addition  we estimate forfeitures based on historical option and restricted stock unit activity on a grant by grant basis 
we may revise the estimate throughout the vesting period based on actual activity 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of us gaap  which requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
valuation allowances are provided  if  based upon the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
net loss from discontinued operations for the year ended december  included a non cash increase of the valuation allowance on cumulative federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets of approximately thousand  thousand and million  respectively 
these deferred tax assets are primarily related to federal  state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards that we believe cannot be utilized in the foreseeable future 
us gaap requires a company to evaluate its deferred tax assets on a regular basis to determine if a valuation allowance against the net deferred tax assets is required 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law 
as a matter of course  we may be audited by various taxing authorities and these audits may result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes 
us gaap addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
us gaap provides guidance on how an enterprise should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purpose of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits 
we determined that upon the conclusion of our tax examination  the respective tax positions were settled and we recognized various uncertain tax benefits as discrete events  which had an impact on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and accounting standards updates recently adopted in june  an update was made to consolidation consolidation of variable interest entities  to replace the calculation for determining which entities  if any  have a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity vie from a quantitative risk based calculation  to a qualitative approach that focuses on identifying which entities have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the vie s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie or the right to receive benefits from the vie 
the update requires an ongoing assessment as to whether an entity is the primary beneficiary of a vie  modifies the presentation of consolidated vie assets and liabilities  and requires additional disclosures about a company s involvement in vies 
this update was effective for annual periods beginning after november   for interim periods within the first annual reporting period and for interim and annual periods thereafter 
earlier application was prohibited 
we have adopted the provisions of this update as of january  and there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in february  an update was made to subsequent events 
this update removes the requirement for a public filer to disclose a date in both issued and revised financial statements 
this update is effective upon issuance of the final update  except for the use of the issued date for conduit debt obligators 
that amendment is effective for interim or annual periods ending after june  we have adopted the provisions of this update as of march  and there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in march  an update was made to derivatives and hedging 
this update provides clarification and related additional examples to improve financial reporting by resolving potential ambiguity about the breadth of the embedded credit derivative scope exception 
this update is effective for each reporting entity at the beginning of the first fiscal quarter beginning after june  we have adopted the provisions of this update as of june  and there was no material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
accounting standards updates not yet effective in october  an update was made to software certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
this update changes the accounting model for revenue arrangements that include both tangible products and software elements 
this update removed tangible products containing software components and nonsoftware components that function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality from the scope of the software revenue guidance in software revenue recognition 
this update also provides guidance on how a vendor should allocate arrangement consideration to deliverables in an arrangement that includes both tangible products and software  how to allocate arrangement consideration when an arrangement includes deliverables both included and excluded from the scope of software revenue guidance and provides additional disclosure requirements 
this update is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  we will adopt the provisions of this update and do not anticipate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in january  an update was made to fair value measurements and disclosures 
this update requires new disclosures of transfers in and out of levels and and of activity in level fair value measurements 
the update also clarifies the existing disclosures for levels of disaggregation and about inputs and valuation techniques 
this update is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we have adopted a portion of the provisions of this update as of january  and have included the additional disclosure requirements 
we will adopt the remaining portion of the provisions of this update and do not anticipate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in april  an update was made to compensation stock compensation 
this update provides amendments to clarify that an employee share based payment award with an exercise price denominated in the currency of a market in which a substantial portion of the entity s equity securities trades should not be considered to contain a condition that is not a market  performance  or service condition 
therefore  an entity would classify such an award as a liability if it otherwise qualifies as equity 
this update is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is permitted 
we will adopt the provisions of this update and do not anticipate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  an update was made to intangibles goodwill and other 
this update modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the amendments in this update are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is not permitted 
we will adopt the provisions of this update and do not anticipate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  an update was made to business combinations 
the amendments in this update specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments in this update also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments in this update are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is permitted 
we will adopt the provisions of this update and do not anticipate a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
trends related to the current economic environment in  we expect improvements in the us economy to not contribute measurably to our growth 
growth in consumer lending has lagged the general economic recovery 
the lingering weakness in consumer lending could affect our financial performance in in two primary ways 
first  lower new card issuances at our financial institution clients could translate into lower subscriber additions in our consumer products and services segment 
second  charge or credit card delinquencies and card cancellations may be higher for certain of our services 
also  the lingering economic weakness has made acquiring and maintaining business more difficult  which we expect to persist in results of continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items on our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of revenue year ended december  revenue operating expenses marketing commissions cost of revenue general and administrative goodwill  intangible and long lived asset impairment charges depreciation amortization total operating expenses loss income from operations interest income interest expense other expense income  net loss income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit expense loss income from continuing operations we have three reportable segments with continuing operations through the period ended december  consumer products and services  online brand protection and bail bonds industry solutions 
our consumer products and services segment includes our consumer protection and other consumer products and services 
this segment consists of identity theft management tools  services from our relationship with a third party that administers referrals for identity theft to major banking institutions and breach response services  membership product offerings and other subscription based services such as life and accidental death insurance 
our online brand protection segment includes corporate brand protection provided by net enforcers 
our bail bonds industry solutions segment includes the software management solutions for the bail bond industry provided by captira analytical 
years ended december  and in thousands the consolidated results of continuing operations are as follows consumer bail bonds products and online brand industry services protection solutions consolidated year ended december  revenue operating expenses marketing commissions cost of revenue general and administrative goodwill  intangible and long lived asset impairment charges depreciation amortization total operating expenses income loss from operations year ended december  revenue operating expenses marketing commissions cost of revenue general and administrative goodwill  intangible and long lived asset impairment charges depreciation amortization total operating expenses income loss from operations consumer products and services segment overview our income from operations for our consumer products and services segment increased in the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this is primarily due to growth in revenue from existing clients  growth in our direct to consumer business and decreased marketing expenses in our direct subscription and direct to consumer business 
this is partially offset by increased commissions as a result of increased sales and effective commission rates in our ongoing direct subscriber base and increased general and administrative expenses 
our subscription revenue see other data increased to million from million in the comparable period 
years ended december  difference revenue operating expenses marketing commissions cost of revenue general and administrative depreciation amortization total operating expenses income from operations revenue 
the increase in revenue is primarily the result of growth in revenue from existing clients  the increase in the ratio of revenue from direct marketing arrangements to revenue from indirect subscribers and increased revenue from our direct to consumer business 
the growth in revenue from existing clients is primarily from new and ongoing subscribers converting to higher priced product offerings 
in our direct to consumer business  the ongoing marketing investment has resulted in new subscribers at higher price points

additionally  we prepaid the remaining principal balance of our revolving credit facility in the fourth quarter of therefore  our outstanding balance under the credit agreement was zero as of december  the credit agreement contains certain customary covenants  including among other things covenants that limit or restrict the incurrence of liens  the incurrence of certain indebtedness  mergers  dissolutions  liquidation  or consolidations  acquisitions other than certain permitted acquisitions  sales of substantially all of our or any co borrowers assets  the declaration of certain dividends or distributions  transactions with affiliates other than co borrowers under the credit agreement other than on fair and reasonable terms  and the creation or acquisition of any direct or indirect subsidiary of ours that is not a domestic subsidiary unless such subsidiary becomes a guarantor

we are currently in compliance with all such covenants 
our credit agreement with bank of america expires in december we intend to replace the credit facility prior to its expiration 
although we believe we can do so on terms at least as favorable as the current facility  however  such terms will be subject to market conditions which may change significantly 
in  we entered into certain interest rate swap transactions that converted our variable rate long term debt to fixed rate debt 
the swaps modified our interest rate exposure by effectively converting the variable rate on our term loan to a fixed rate of per annum through december and on our revolving credit facility to a fixed rate of per annum through december in the year ended december  and  there was no material ineffective portion of the hedge and therefore  no impact to the consolidated statements of operations 
in the year ended december   as a result of the prepayment of the remaining principal balance on our term loan and revolving credit facility  we no longer met the criteria for hedge accounting 
therefore  we discontinued our cash flow hedges and terminated the interest rate swaps with the counterparty 
as a result  we reclassified a loss of thousand into earnings and paid cash of thousand to terminate the swaps
