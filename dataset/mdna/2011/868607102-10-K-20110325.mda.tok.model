comparison of with for the year ended december   supreme experienced increased demand for our products but incurred a loss for as a result  we have restructured our senior management team as described above  identified areas of additional improvements  implemented new processes  and will continue to focus on increasing our gross margins and reducing our operating costs 
the major structural changes in the organization include closing the oregon manufacturing facility  eliminating low margin and low volume product lines  replacing a general manager at an underperforming location  reducing headcount in selected areas of the business  and reducing the selling prices of assets held for sale of certain idled facilities to reflect the current depressed market conditions which will further facilitate the sales of these properties to improve cash flow 
having taken the above described actions  we believe that we are more competitively positioned 
we are also encouraged by our large backlog which totaled million at year end compared with million from a year ago 
based upon industry analysts  increasing age of fleet vehicles in use  our own evaluated backlog and large fleet orders received for spring  we are beginning to see improved market demand 
while we are experiencing firmer demand across all of our major product categories  the company needs to continue its focus on restoring profitability 
as we increase production to meet our backlog  we will continue to maintain a conservative and cautious view of our markets as we move forward 
while we were extremely disappointed in the loss incurred in  we experienced increased revenues  and accordingly  reduced our loss from continuing operations before income taxes of million in to million for the year ended december  we improved our gross profit in by as compared with the above comparison to reflects the effects of the recession and restrictive credit markets which prompted a severe and pervasive downturn in the commercial vehicle industry 
the results were further impacted by approximately million of impairment charges on selected idle assets  an increase in certain contingent obligations  and higher group health insurance claims 
the company also had certain underperforming locations during where field operating management changes have subsequently been implemented 

table of contents additionally  in december of we made a decision to close our oregon manufacturing facility to exit this unprofitable geographic region 
in the fourth quarter of  the company terminated its silver crown luxury motorhome operations due to the unprecedented tight credit markets caused by the severe economic recession which led to a significant reduction of new motorhome orders and the cancellation of existing orders 
the company has reclassified prior period results accordingly as discontinued operations for these two operations 
the company s asset management improved during the year as evidenced by its improved inventory turns  days sales outstanding  and its cash flow cycle which was reduced by approximately days  or  when compared with the prior year end 
in our effort to maximize profits  we have invested in product improvements  technology  and our sales organization 
with improvements from our signature body and improved production processes  we believe that our truck division is well positioned to capitalize on an increase in demand for dry freight units 
further  we continually work to improve our operational processes  researching new materials to increase value to our customers with an emphasis on green materials and technologies  while also upgrading existing and developing new product offerings 
we believe new product development is critical to growing our revenue base since changing market conditions require innovative new products 
net sales net sales for the year ended december  increased million to million as compared with million for the year ended december  the following table presents the components of net sales and the changes from to s omitted change specialized vehicles trucks buses armored vehicles composites the truck division sales increase of million  or for the year  was primarily attributable to an improved retail truck market and increased fleet shipments 
we have experienced improved backlog for trucks and believe that we are well positioned to benefit from favorable industry indicators and the expectation that customers will begin replacing aging equipment 
additionally  we are encouraged by large fleet orders received with shipments to commence during the first half of our startrans bus division continued to experience good demand for its product in  increasing its sales by million  or 
this increase was the result of contract awards for niche products and the availability of funds from the federal economic stimulus plan enabling state and local transit authorities to purchase new units 
we anticipate sales to remain comparable  or decrease slightly  due to contracts expiring and the uncertainty of the availability of federal funds for transit vehicles 
the armored division continued to experience strong demand with revenue increases of million  or for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of our contract with the us department of state dos to produce armored suburbans for embassies abroad and improved demand for cash in transit vehicles

the cash in transit and other armored vehicles are well positioned to enable us to increase these revenues as we move into the composite division sells fiberglass reinforced plywood and other fiberglass products to supreme for use in the production of certain of its truck bodies and to third parties 
the decrease for the year of million  or  was due to lower sales to third parties

the bus product line accounted for of our sales in compared with in this was partially offset by an increase in the material percentage in the truck division due to a competitive pricing environment 
as the general economic environment begins to show signs of improvement  the potential for future raw material cost increases remains a concern for certain commodities including but not limited to aluminum  steel  and wood 
we closely monitor all major commodities and periodically review the financial stability of our primary vendors 
the company will continue to address certain raw material cost escalations by increasing the price of our products as necessary and as our market will accept them 
we also strive to reduce manufacturing costs through the use of improved technologies  processes  and supply chain management tactics and strategies 
direct labor direct labor as a percentage of net sales increased by for the year ended december  as compared with the increase in the direct labor percentage was due to inefficiencies at certain plant locations and new employee training costs in order to support the higher production and sales levels in in addition  our labor percentage increased during the last quarter of the year to train additional new employees to fulfill our large backlog of fleet orders with shipments commencing in overhead manufacturing overhead as a percentage of net sales decreased by for the year ended december  as compared with the overall overhead percentage declined due to the fixed nature of certain overhead expenses that do not fluctuate with sales volume changes 
partially offsetting the decrease in the percentage were group health insurance costs which were considerably higher than anticipated as a result of several large claims

b see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding property leases 
the company s historical practice has been to exclude the interest payments from the contractual obligations table due to the variability of its interest rates and the variability in its revolving line of credit which represented of its debt obligations at december  critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in management s opinion  the company s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  inventory relief  accrued insurance  and accrued warranty 
revenue recognition the company generally recognizes revenue when products are shipped to the customer 
revenue on certain customer requested bill and hold transactions is recognized after the customer is notified that the products have been completed according to customer specifications  have passed all of the company s quality control inspections  and are ready for delivery based on established delivery terms 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required which would adversely affect our future operating results 
excess and obsolete inventories the company must make estimates regarding the future use of raw materials and finished products and provide for obsolete or slow moving inventories 
if actual product life cycles  product demand  and or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required which would adversely affect future operating results 
inventory relief for monthly and quarterly financial reporting  cost of sales is recorded and inventories are relieved by the use of standard bills of material adjusted for scrap and other estimated factors affecting inventory relief 
because of our large and diverse product line and the customized nature of each order  it is difficult to place full reliance on the bills of material for accurate relief of inventories 
although the company continues to refine the process of creating accurate bills of materials  manual adjustments which are based on estimates are necessary in an effort to assure correct relief of inventories for products sold 
the calculations to estimate costs not captured in the bill of materials take into account the customized nature of products  historical inventory relief percentages  scrap variances  and other factors which could impact inventory relief 
the accuracy of the inventory relief is not fully known until physical inventories are conducted at each of the company s locations 
we conduct semi annual physical inventories at a majority of locations and schedule them in a manner that provides coverage in each of our calendar quarters 
we have invested significant resources in our continuing effort to improve the physical inventory process and accuracy of our inventory accounting system 
accrued insurance the company has a self insured retention against product liability claims with insurance coverage over and above the retention 
the company is also self insured for a portion of its employee medical benefits and workers compensation 
product liability claims are routinely reviewed by the company s insurance carrier  and management routinely reviews other self insurance risks for purposes of establishing ultimate loss estimates 
in addition  management must determine estimated liability for claims incurred but not reported 
such estimates  and any subsequent changes in estimates  may result in adjustments to our operating results in the future 
the company utilizes a wholly owned small captive insurance company to insure certain of its business risks 
certain risks  traditionally self insured by the company and its subsidiaries  are insured by the captive insurance subsidiary 
the captive insurance subsidiary helps the company manage its risk exposures and  under the internal revenue code  the net underwriting income of such a small captive is not taxable 
accrued warranty the company provides limited warranties for periods of up to five years from the date of retail sale
