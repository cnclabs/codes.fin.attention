item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion below contains forward looking statements  as defined in section e of the exchange act  that reflect our current expectations regarding our future growth  results of operations  cash flows  performance and business prospects and opportunities  as well as assumptions made by  and information currently available to  our management 
we have tried to identify forward looking statements by using words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  intend  will  and similar expressions  but these words are not the exclusive means of identifying forward looking statements 
these statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to various risks  uncertainties  and other factors  including  but not limited to  those matters discussed in item a risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k  that could cause our actual growth  results of operations  cash flows  performance and business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these statements 
except as expressly required by the federal securities laws  we undertake no obligation to update such factors or to publicly announce the results of any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events  developments  or changed circumstances  or for any other reason 
as used in this annual report on form k  the terms we  us  our  broadwind  broadwind energy and the company refer to broadwind energy  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
dollars are presented in thousands unless otherwise stated business overview broadwind energy provides technologically advanced high value products and services to energy  mining and infrastructure sector customers  primarily in the us our most significant presence is within the us wind industry  where we believe we are the only independent company that offers our breadth of products and services to the market 
our product and service portfolio provides our customers  including wind turbine manufacturers  wind farm developers and wind farm operators  with access to a broad array of component and service offerings 
outside of the wind market  we provide precision gearing and specialty weldments to industrial customers  particularly in the energy  mining and infrastructure sectors 
the company was built primarily through acquisitions made in and beginning in late  the severe impacts of the global economic downturn and banking crisis significantly impacted the wind energy business in general and broadwind in particular 
the recession and lack of adequate capital to fund new wind farm developments caused new equipment order intake to drop  contributed to pressure on product margins and reduced service opportunities 
although we had a number of multi year framework agreements in place with key customers  their purchase requirements dropped sharply which necessitated renegotiations of volume commitments and prices in certain instances 
accordingly  the decline in production levels across our business units has created production volume inefficiencies within our operations and cost structures  which has had a negative effect on our operating profits and gross margins 
we have taken a number of steps to reduce operating costs  repay debt and improve our financial position and product offerings 
as such  we believe we are well positioned to capture market opportunities associated with growth in wind energy and other industrial demand in the us we believe that growth in the us wind energy market will be driven by i macroeconomic factors  including economic recovery and increased demand for electricity  rising energy prices and federal and state level wind development incentives  ii upgrades to existing transmission infrastructure and increasing proliferation of smart grid technology  and iii the maturation of technologies and services within the wind industry  including increased turbine efficiencies  a coordinated global supply chain and 
table of contents improved focus on equipment maintenance and reliability 
given our significant installed manufacturing and service platform  we believe we will be able to substantially grow revenues without making significant investment in additional capital equipment or manufacturing capacity 
we review our goodwill balances for impairment on at least an annual basis and review our intangible and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset carrying value amount may not be recoverable 
during the second quarter of  the company identified a triggering event associated with the continued deterioration in the financial performance within our services segment 
this triggering event required a revision of the company projection of future operating results and cash flows for this segment in light of the continued economic weakness in the wind energy industry 
we performed our review of goodwill based on the carrying value of these assets as of june   and the estimate of fair value for each of our operating segments was based primarily on projected future results  cash flows and other assumptions 
as a result of this review  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of  at june  in our services segment 
during the fourth quarter of  the company identified triggering events associated with the company current period operating losses  its history of continued operating losses and its revised projections of operating results and cash flows developed as part of the strategic planning process 
as a result  our review of other long lived assets indicated that the carrying values of customer relationships  trade name and property and equipment at our services segment were also impaired 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge during the fourth quarter of  in addition  we determined that our brandon  south dakota tower manufacturing facility was impaired and recorded an impairment charge to fixed assets of  in connection with our december decision to divest our badger transport  inc subsidiary badger  which formerly comprised our logistics segment  we have classified badger as a discontinued operation 
the assets and liabilities of badger have been classified as assets held for sale and liabilities held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet 
in connection with the reclassification to assets held for sale  we recorded an impairment charge of  to write down the assets to their net realizable value 
the impairment charge is included in loss from discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of operations 
in connection with our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of october   we determined that the goodwill balance attributable to our gearing segment was impaired due to a deterioration in financial performance during and as a result of the subsequent fourth quarter revision in our projection of future operating results and cash flows in light of the effect of the continued economic downturn on the wind gearing industry 
additionally  we determined that the carrying value of our rba trade name was impaired as a result of the merger of the operations of our subsidiary rba inc rba into our towers segment in december and that rba customer relationship intangible was impaired due to a revision in projected revenues and cash flows associated with this customer relationship 
we recorded goodwill and intangible impairment charges of  and  respectively  to properly reflect the carrying value of these assets 
in the future  if our projected discounted cash flows associated with our operating segments do not exceed the carrying value of their net assets  we may be required to record additional write downs of the carrying value of intangible assets or other long lived assets associated with any of our operating segments  in which event our operating results  and the market price of our common stock may be materially adversely affected

towers segment operating loss increased by  from a loss of during the year ended december   to a loss of  during the year ended december  the increased loss from operations was primarily attributable to a fixed asset impairment charge of  related to our investment in the brandon  south dakota tower facility 
additionally  a less profitable sales mix resulted in margin degradation of  as well as in higher labor costs mainly associated with premium costs and inefficiencies that were incurred to support the increased production volume during the fourth quarter 
these items were partially offset by the absence of  of start up costs incurred in associated with our wind tower manufacturing facility in abilene  texas and a non recurring impairment charge with respect to a customer relationship and trade name intangible in the aggregate amount of  taken in towers operating margins deteriorated from during the year ended december  to during the year ended december   as a result of these factors

additionally  the increase in operating loss was also the result of a continued decline in wind gearing production volumes  which resulted in direct labor and manufacturing overhead inefficiencies and under absorption of fixed operating costs 
material costs were  higher due to additional product rework costs and scrap associated with specification adjustments for new wind gearing production orders 
the increase in operating loss was also impacted by higher depreciation expense of  associated with capital investments made in  and expenses and fees of  incurred in connection with the negotiation of amendments to our credit facility with bank of america  partially offset by lower outside service expenses associated with a reduced level of activity and lower selling  general and administrative expenses due to cost reduction initiatives

summary of critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments that we use in applying our critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results that we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting 
table of contents policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates regarding matters that are inherently uncertain 
we have identified the accounting policies listed below to be critical to obtain an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
this section should also be read in conjunction with note description of business and summary of significant accounting policies in part iv  item in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these and other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete and when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  transfer of title has occurred or services have been rendered  the selling price is fixed or determinable  collectability is reasonably assured and delivery has occurred per the terms of the contract 
customer deposits and other receipts are deferred and recognized when the revenue is realized and earned 
in some instances  products are sold under terms included in bill and hold sales arrangements that result in different timing for revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue under these arrangements only when the buyer requests the bill and hold arrangement  a fixed schedule for delivery exists  the ordered goods are segregated from inventory and not available to fill orders and the goods are complete and ready for shipment 
assuming these required revenue recognition criteria are met  revenue is recognized upon completion of product manufacture and customer acceptance 
warranty liability we provide warranty terms that generally range from one to seven years for various products relating to workmanship and materials supplied by us 
in certain contracts  we have recourse provisions for items that would enable recovery from third parties for amounts paid to customers under warranty provisions 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we have recorded a reserve for excess of cost over market value in our inventory allowance 
market value of inventory  and management judgment of the need for reserves  encompasses consideration of other business factors including physical condition  inventory holding period  contract terms  and usefulness 
inventories are valued based on an average cost method  which approximates the first in  first out fifo basis 
inventories consist of raw materials  work in process  and finished goods 
raw materials consist of components and parts for general production use 
work in process consists of labor and overhead  processing costs  purchased subcomponents  and materials purchased for specific customer orders 
finished goods consist of components purchased from third parties as well as components manufactured by us that will be used to produce final customer products 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our assets may not be recovered 
we test intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of our assets may not be recovered 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units 
our method of determining the fair value is based upon our estimate of the projected future discounted cash flows of our reporting units 

table of contents if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges related to intangible assets 
long lived assets we review property and equipment and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of such assets 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to property and equipment and other long lived assets 
income taxes we account for income taxes based upon an asset and liability approach 
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities versus the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
under this method  deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the impact of tax rate changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year that the change is enacted 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize the expected future income tax benefits of net operating loss carryforwards as deferred income tax assets 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
we also account for the uncertainty in income taxes related to the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
we follow the applicable pronouncement guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition related to the uncertainty in these income tax positions 
recent accounting pronouncements the following is a listing of recent accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board the fasb and their effect on the company 
in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic 
asu provides additional disclosure requirements related to fair value measurements 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and 
table of contents settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
disclosure requirements applicable to level transactions are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years  with early adoption permitted 
the portion of asu that was effective beginning after december  did not have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
additionally  we do not anticipate that the disclosure requirements applicable to level transactions that are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in october  the fasb issued asu  revenue recognition topic 
asu provides additional guidance related to the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit and eliminates the residual method of allocation 
asu is effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after september   with early adoption permitted 
we do not anticipate that the provisions of asu will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity  financial position and capital resources at december   cash and cash equivalents totaled  compared to our cash and cash equivalents which totaled  at december  in january  we sold ten million newly issued shares of our common stock for proceeds of approximately  net of underwriting discounts 
additionally  the completion of our equity offering enabled us to use a portion of these proceeds to reduce our outstanding indebtedness 
in january  we repaid outstanding indebtedness due to bank of america and icb in the amounts of  and  respectively 
the repayment of this indebtedness reduced our future debt service requirements  and eliminated subsidiary specific financial covenant requirements and asset liens 
we used the remainder of these proceeds for general operating purposes and specific capital expenditures  specifically to help us start our drivetrain service center 
in september  the company domestic subsidiaries subsidiaries entered into account purchase agreements the ap agreements with wells fargo 
the aggregate facility limit of the ap agreements is  at december   no amounts were drawn under the ap agreements  and we had the ability to borrow up to  subject to maintaining a month end minimum total cash balance of  our ability to make scheduled payments on our debt and other financial obligations will depend on our future financial and operating performance 
however  if sales and subsequent collections from several of our large customers  as well as revenues generated from new customer orders  are not materially consistent with management expectations  we may encounter cash flow and liquidity issues 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
furthermore  if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we will likely be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our plans for expansion and growth  and this could affect our overall operations 
any additional equity financing  if available  may be dilutive to stockholders  and additional debt financing  if available  will likely require financial covenants or other restrictions 
while we believe that we will continue to have sufficient cash flows to operate our businesses and meet our financial debt covenants  there can be no assurances that our operations will generate sufficient cash or that credit facilities will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 

table of contents sources and uses of cash operating cash flows during the year ended december   net cash flows used in operating activities totaled  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of  for the year ended december  the decrease in net cash provided by operating activities as compared to the prior year was primarily attributable to an increase in our inventory balances 
the increase in inventories was the result of replenishing raw material inventories to meet current production needs 
investing cash flows during the years ended december  and  net cash used in investing activities totaled  and  respectively

historically  our accounts receivable are highly concentrated with a select number of customers 
during the years ended december  and  our five largest customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of consolidated revenues 
additionally  as of december  and  our five largest customers comprised approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding accounts receivable balances 
we are also exposed to potentially significant credit risk as our cash deposits often exceed the federally insured amounts 
to address this we adhere to a formal investment policy which requires us to invest excess cash in efforts to diversify our cash away from any single financial institution 
commodity risk exposure we are dependent upon the supply of certain raw materials used in our production processes  and these raw materials are exposed to price fluctuations on the open market 
the primary raw material we use is steel 
to reduce price risk caused by market fluctuations  we have incorporated price adjustment clauses in certain sales contracts 
management believes a hypothetical change in the price of steel and other raw materials would not have a significant effect on our consolidated results of operations or cash flows because these costs are generally passed through to our customers
