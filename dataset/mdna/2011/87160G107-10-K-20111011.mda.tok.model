our business the company is a medical device company 
through continuous improvement and development of our people  our mission is to design  manufacture and market innovative surgical devices and consumables of the highest quality in order to assist and enable surgeons who perform surgery around the world to provide a better quality of life for their patients 
the company s primary focus is on the surgical disciplines of ophthalmology vitreoretinal and neurosurgery 
our distribution channels include a combination of direct and independent sales organizations and important strategic alliances with market leaders 
the company s product lines focus upon precision engineered disposable and reusable devices  procedural kits and the delivery of laser energy  ultrasound  electrosurgery  aspiration  illumination and irrigation  often delivered in multiple combinations 
enterprise wide sales information is included in note to the consolidated audited financial statements 

table of contents new product sales the company s business strategy has been  and is expected to continue to be  the development  manufacture and marketing of new technologies for the ophthalmic vitreoretinal and neurosurgical markets 
new products  which management defines as products first available for sale within the prior month period  accounted for approximately million  or percent  of total sales for the company for fiscal for fiscal  new products accounted for approximately million  or percent  of total sales for the company 
these new product sales were primarily in our disposable products both in the ophthalmic and marketing partners markets 
the company s past revenue growth has been closely aligned with the adoption by surgeons of new technologies introduced by the company 
we expect adoption rates for the company s new products in the future to have a positive effect on its operating performance 
demand trends the company s sales increased percent during the fiscal year ended july  including million of deferred revenue recognized compared with the previous fiscal year 
the two most significant factors impacting this increase were a million increase in ophthalmic sales and a million increase in oem sales 
the increased sales were partially offset by a million decrease in our neurosurgery sales due to the transition of the majority of our direct neurosurgery product sales to our marketing partners 
the largest portion of this decline can be attributed to the loss of million of omni capital equipment that was included in our direct neurosurgery sales and which the company no longer sells 
overall sales of our disposable products grew million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal sales of capital equipment  including the sales of omni capital equipment  declined by approximately million  or percent  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the downward trend  after excluding the loss of the omni ultrasonic aspirator sales  is a result of hospitals tightly controlling their capital budgets 
a study performed by market scope in february predicts a steady growth of percent per year in retinal procedures worldwide driven by an increase in the elderly population worldwide  an increase in the number of surgeons  an increase in the number of diseases treated with vitrectomy and an increase in frequency of diabetic complications due to the obesity epidemic 
we estimate that the vitreoretinal market grew approximately seven percent to million in neurosurgical procedures on a global basis continue to rise at an estimated to percent growth rate driven by an aging global population  new technologies  advances in surgical techniques and a growing global market resulting from ongoing improvements in healthcare delivery in third world countries  among other factors 
based upon this growth in procedures  sales of neurosurgical products worldwide are forecasted to increase by approximately percent 
in addition  the company believes that the demand for high quality  innovate products and new technologies consistent with the company s devices and disposables will continue to favorably impact procedure growth in the ophthalmic and neurosurgical markets 
pricing trends the company has generally been able to maintain the average selling prices for its products in the face of downward pricing pressure in the healthcare industry 
however  increased competition in the company s capital equipment market segments  in combination with customer budget constraints  capital scarcity and the transition of procedures to the ambulatory surgery center  has the potential to negatively impact the company s selling prices on these devices 
the company has no major domestic group purchasing agreements 

table of contents economic trends economic conditions may continue to negatively impact capital expenditures at the hospital  ambulatory surgical center and physician level 
further  global economic conditions continue to negatively impact the volume and average selling price of the company s capital equipment 
our business strategy the company s key strategy is to enhance shareholder value through profitable revenue growth in ophthalmology and neurosurgery markets through the identification and development of reusable and disposable devices in conjunction with leading surgeons and marketing partners and to build out a strong operational infrastructure and financial foundation within which prudently financed growth opportunities can be realized and implemented 
at the same time  we will maintain vigilance and sensitivity to new challenges which may arise from changes in the definition and delivery of appropriate healthcare in our fields of interest 
in fiscal  our primary strategic priorities are to drive the company onto a different growth trajectory by introducing new products and to continue to enhance the profitability of our operational platform by focusing on manufacturing efficiencies

other income expense other expense in fiscal increased to  compared to income of million in fiscal the increase was primarily due to the one time impact of the  gain from sale of the omni product line to stryker and the million in settlement gain from alcon which both occurred in fiscal interest expense decreased to  in fiscal as the company was able to pay off the remaining bond on the o fallon  missouri facility and further reduce its other debt 
in addition  the company recorded a  loss on the sale of the omni product line to stryker as certain receivables were deemed to be uncollectible due to the change in the distribution model 
operating income  income taxes and net income operating income for fiscal was million  as compared to operating income of million in the comparable fiscal period

direct neurosurgery sales fell million  or percent  to million in fiscal compared with fiscal this decline in neurosurgery sales was the result of the transition of the majority of our direct neurosurgery sales to codman and stryker under new marketing partner agreements during fiscal new sales to our domestic marketing partners comprised million of sales in fiscal  partially offsetting the loss in neurosurgery sales 
total neurosurgery sales  including sales to marketing partners  declined million in fiscal  or percent  as compared to fiscal total oem sales fell percent in fiscal to million compared with million in fiscal the two most significant factors impacting the decrease in our sales during fiscal were the transition of the majority of our direct neurosurgery sales to our marketing partners which resulted in a million decrease in our net sales and the significant decline in our capital equipment sales of approximately million  or percent  in fiscal  which came from hospitals tightly controlling their capital budgets during the fiscal year 
these decreases were primarily offset by the growth in our disposable product sales of million  or percent

gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales was percent in fiscal  compared to percent in fiscal gross profit as a percentage of net sales for fiscal compared to fiscal increased approximately percentage points 
there were several factors which impacted the gross profit margin increase in fiscal the elimination of a non recurring  fourth quarter write off in fiscal of inventory primarily due to excess and discontinued inventory and improved absorption of both labor and overhead deriving from our lean manufacturing initiative  partially offset by the change in our sales mix arising from the increase in our international ophthalmic sales and from transitioning the majority of our neurosurgery product sales to our marketing partners

the inventory on hand was unchanged when compared to july  and days favorable to july  utilizing the trailing twelve months of cost of sales 
although management attained its goal of reducing inventory to million in the fiscal year ended july   it has since raised inventory levels to what it believes is sufficient to support new product launches and to support service level goals 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million for the year ended july   compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of approximately million for the comparable fiscal period 
the decrease of approximately million was primarily attributable to the impact of change in the deferred revenue arising from the settlement with alcon of approximately million 
in addition  the decrease was attributable to net increases applicable to deferred income taxes of million  receivables of million  and inventories of million 
these decreases were partially offset by net increases applicable primarily to income taxes payable of million  million increase in accrued expenses  the change in the gain on sale of the omni product line of  and higher prepaid expenses of  cash flows used by investing activities were million for the year ended july   compared to cash provided by investing activities of  for the comparable fiscal period

management believes that cash flows from operations  together with available cash  will be sufficient to meet the company s working capital including taxes due on the alcon settlement  capital expenditure and debt service needs for the next twelve months 
in addition  the remaining deferred revenue from the alcon settlement will flow through our statement of income over approximately the next fifteen years 
however  as the cash has already been collected  it will not impact our future liquidity and will reduce our cash flow from operations

use of estimates and critical accounting policies the financial results of the company are affected by the selection and application of accounting policies and methods 
significant accounting policies which require management s judgment are discussed below 
revenue recognition the company primarily records revenue from product sales when the revenue is realized and the product is shipped from its facilities 
this includes satisfying the following criteria the arrangement with the customer is evident  usually through receipt of a purchase order  the sales price is fixed and determinable  delivery to the carrier has occurred  and collectability is reasonably ensured 
freight and shipping billed to customers is included in net sales  and the cost of shipping is included in cost of sales 
sales tax billed to customers is included as a liability as products are shipped 

table of contents the terms and conditions of sales to both our domestic and international distributors do not differ materially from the terms and conditions of sales to our domestic and international end user customers 
service revenue substantially relates to repairs of products and is recognized when the service has been completed 
revenue from royalty fees is recorded as the products bearing the trademark are shipped 
deferred revenue in december  the company received a payment from codman to establish exclusivity on certain generator products and accessories 
revenue from this payment has been deferred and is being amortized over the expected term of the agreement 
on april   the company entered into a settlement and license agreement with alcon pursuant to which alcon paid to the company million 
the net proceeds to the company were million after contingency payments to attorneys 
the company recognized a gain from this agreement of million in the third quarter of fiscal the remaining million has been accounted for as an up front license fee under the confidential settlement and license agreement and will be deferred and recognized as earned over a period currently estimated to be fifteen years based upon the units expected to be shipped to alcon under a supply agreement entered pursuant to the settlement 
the company has recognized  of this revenue as the estimate of these shipments has been revised for the fiscal year ended july  significant and unanticipated changes to the forecasted unit volume over the life of the agreement or changes in the expected contribution margins associated with these products could change the timing of the revenue recognized under this agreement 
inventories inventories  consisting of purchased materials  direct labor and manufacturing overhead  are stated at the lower of cost  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method  or market 
the company s inventory is very dynamic and new products are added frequently 
thus  the company reviews the valuation of its inventory on a quarterly basis and determines if a valuation allowance is necessary for items that have not had their values updated recently 
in addition  the company evaluates inventories for excess quantities and identified obsolescence quarterly 
the company s evaluation includes an analysis of historical sales levels by product and projections of future demand  as well as estimates of quantities required to support warranty and other repairs 
to the extent that it determines there are some excess quantities based on its projected levels of sales and other requirements  or obsolete material in inventory  it records valuation reserves against all or a portion of the value of the related parts or products 
if future cost valuations  future demand or market conditions are different from the company s projections  a change in recorded inventory valuation reserves may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
amortization periods the company records amortization of intangible assets using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of these assets 
it bases the determination of these useful lives on the period over which it expects the related assets to contribute to its cash flows or in the case of patents  their legal life  whichever is shorter 
if the company s assessment of the useful lives of intangible assets changes  it may change future amortization expense see impairment of long lived assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where a specific customer is unable to meet its financial obligations to the company  the company records an allowance against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount that management reasonably expects to collect 
for all other customers  the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  the current business environment and historical experience 
accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received 
the company generally does not charge interest on past due amounts in accounts receivable 
the company has a history of minimal uncollectible accounts 
if the financial condition of customers or the length of time that receivables are past due were to change  the company may change the recorded amount of allowances for doubtful accounts in the future 

table of contents patents and research and development incremental legal and other costs to obtain patents are capitalized to a patent asset 
salaries  benefits and other direct costs of product development are expensed as operating expenses in r d costs 
patents are amortized to operations under the straight line method over the shorter of the remaining statutory life of the patent or the cash flow stream associated with that patent 
goodwill as of july   we have recorded million of goodwill 
we perform purchase price allocations including recognition of intangible assets when we make a business combination 
the excess of the purchase price after the allocation of fair values to tangible assets and identifiable intangibles is allocated to goodwill 
we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized and whether the assets have finite or indefinite lives for amortization purposes 
currently  we have one reporting unit 
we perform our annual impairment test on goodwill in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc absent any impairment indicators  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis 
the company performs its impairment tests during the fourth fiscal quarter 
our tests may include three approaches to determine the fair value of our reporting unit 
the first approach is discounted cash flows  which focuses on our expected cash flows available for common equity owners 
net cash flows to equity is defined as our earnings plus depreciation  amortization and interest expense  or ebitda  less our estimated usage of cash for debt  capital expenditures and working capital changes 
the resulting net cash flows and the terminal value our value of invested capital at the end of the five year projection period are then discounted to derive an indication of the present value of the company s invested capital 
interest bearing debt is then subtracted to arrive at the company s fair value of equity 
this valuation method is dependent upon management s assumptions made regarding future cash flow and cash requirements and the discount factor used to determine the present value of our future cash flows 
if necessary  we would also analyze two additional valuation methods the guideline company approach and the market capitalization approach 
the guideline company approach focuses on comparing the company to selected reasonably similar  publicly traded companies 
under this approach  valuation multiples are i derived from operating data of selected similar companies  ii evaluated and adjusted based on our strengths and weaknesses relative to this selected group of guideline companies  and iii applied to our revenues and ebitda to arrive at an indication of invested capital 
interest bearing debt is subtracted and a control premium and cash balances are added to arrive at the fair value of the company s equity 
this valuation approach is dependent upon the assumption that our value can be evaluated by analysis of our earnings and strengths and weaknesses relative to the selected similar companies and an appropriate control premium can be determined 
the market capitalization approach focuses on the company s market capitalization over a period of time and applies a control premium to arrive at an indication of fair value 
this valuation approach is dependent upon the performance of our stock and the control premiums utilized in acquisitions completed in the healthcare equipment and supplies industry 
the fair value determined under the discounted cash flows methodology in fiscal resulted in an indication of value which exceeded the book value of the reporting unit by approximately percent 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions or the company s operating performance could require a provision for impairment in a future period 

table of contents other intangibles as of july   we have recorded million of indefinite lived intangible assets for the malis trademark 
the life of a trademark is inextricably related to the life of the product bearing the mark or the life of the business entity owning the trademark 
the company intends to use the trademark indefinitely  and therefore  its useful life is not limited to any specific product 
we perform impairment tests on the carrying value of our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually at the end of july or sooner if we identify an event suggesting possible impairment of the value of this asset 
we test indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment using the discounted cash flow methodology  which focuses on our expected cash flows derived from the use of the intangible asset 
with respect to the trademark  the expected cash flows are reduced by the related income taxes and debt 
the indication of value for the trademark exceeds its book value by approximately percent as of july  significant and unanticipated changes to either the market for the malis branded products or our contract authorizing the use of the malis trademark could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such asset may not be recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the group of assets and their eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic  income taxes asc topic  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
asc topic also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if its more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset not be realized 
in our annual evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance  we take into account various factors  including the expected level of future taxable income in our tax jurisdictions and available tax planning strategies 
if actual results differ from these assumptions made in our annual evaluation of our valuation allowance  we may record a change in valuation allowance through income tax expense in the period this determination is made 
at july   we had deferred tax assets related to net foreign operating loss carryforwards with a tax value of million 
these net foreign operating loss carryforwards have various expiration dates  depending on the country and period in which they occurred 
the company has not established a valuation allowance for these deferred tax assets based upon the company s ability to use these losses by implementing tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income and the expiration dates of these carryforwards 
in addition  the calculations of our tax liabilities involve dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulation 
on august   we adopted the provisions of asc topic related to uncertain tax positions 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we have to determine the probability of certain outcomes 
we reevaluate these positions on a quarterly basis including an analysis of changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  effectively settled issues or net audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement would result in the recognition of an additional charge to the tax provision 
stock based compensation the company utilizes fasb asc topic  compensation stock compensation in accounting for its employee stock options 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the directors and employees requisite service period 
compensation expense is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
of the inputs into the black scholes option pricing model  the one that can impact the value of the options the most is the volatility factor 
for awards occurring in fiscal year ended july   the company has utilized a volatility factor of percent in this calculation 
in addition  the company utilized an expected average risk free interest rate of percent  an expected average life of years and no expected dividends

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and exchange rate variability 
the company has million in cash and cash equivalents with a substantial portion of this cash held in short term money market funds bearing interest at basis points 
interest income from these funds is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
a reduction in the interest on these funds to basis points would decrease the amount of interest income from these funds by approximately  the company has a revolving credit facility and an equipment line of credit facility in place 
the revolving credit facility had no outstanding balance at july   bearing interest at a current rate of libor plus percent 
the equipment line of credit facility had no outstanding balance at july   bearing interest at one month libor plus percent 
interest expense from these credit facilities is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
because the current levels of borrowings are zero  there would be no market risk associated with the interest rates
