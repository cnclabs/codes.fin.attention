item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements included in item in this report 
preformed line products company the company  plpc  we  us  or our was incorporated in ohio in we are an international designer and manufacturer of products and systems employed in the construction and maintenance of overhead and underground networks for the energy  telecommunication  cable operators  information data communication  and other similar industries 
our primary products support  protect  connect  terminate  and secure cables and wires 
we also provide solar hardware systems and mounting hardware for a variety of solar power applications 
our goal is to continue to achieve profitable growth as a leader in the innovation  development  manufacture  and marketing of technically advanced products and services related to energy  communications  and cable systems and to take advantage of this leadership position to sell additional quality products in familiar markets 
we have sales and manufacturing operations in different countries 

table of contents recent developments acquisitions as a result of several global acquisitions since and corresponding significant changes in the company s internal structure  we realigned our business units as of the fourth quarter of  into four operating segments to better capitalize on business development opportunities  improve ongoing services  enhance the utilization of our worldwide resources and global sourcing initiatives and to manage the company better 
we report our segments in four geographic regions plp usa  the americas  emea europe  middle east africa and asia pacific in accordance with accounting standards codified in financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  segment reporting 
each segment distributes a full range of our primary products 
our plp usa segment is comprised of our us operations manufacturing our traditional products primarily supporting our domestic energy and telecommunications products 
our other three segments  the americas  emea and asia pacific support the company s energy  telecommunications  data communication and solar products in each respective geographical region 
the segment managers responsible for each region report directly to the company s chief executive officer  who is the chief operating decision maker and are accountable for the financial results and performance of their entire segment for which they are responsible 
the business components within each segment are managed to maximize the results of the entire company rather than the results of any individual business component of the segment 
the amount of each segment s performance reported is the measure reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segment and assessing its performance 
we evaluate segment performance and allocate resources based on several factors primarily based on sales and net income 
the segment information of all prior periods has been recast to conform to the current segment presentation 
on may   we agreed to purchase electropar limited electropar  a new zealand corporation 
electropar limited designs  manufactures and markets pole line and substation hardware for the global electrical utility industry 
electropar is based in new zealand with a subsidiary operation in australia 
we believe that the acquisition of electropar has and will continue to strengthen our position in the power distribution  transmission and substation hardware markets and expand our presence in the asia pacific region 
the acquisition of electropar closed on july  pursuant to the purchase agreement  we acquired all of the equity outstanding of electropar for nz million or million us dollars  net of a customary post closing working capital adjustment of 
million 
the purchase agreement includes customary representations  warranties  covenants and indemnification provisions 
in addition  we may be required to make an additional earn out consideration payment up to nz million or million us dollars based on electropar achieving a financial performance target earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization over the twelve months ending july  the fair value of the contingent consideration arrangement is determined by estimating the expected probability weighted earn out payment discounted to present value 
based upon our initial evaluation of the range of outcomes for this contingent consideration  we have accrued 
million for the additional earn out consideration payment as of the acquisition date 
electropar has been included in our asia pacific reporting segment 
on december   the company and tyco electronics group sa tyco electronics completed a stock and asset purchase agreement  pursuant to which we acquired from tyco electronics its dulmison business for million and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the acquisition of dulmison strengthened our position in the power distribution and transmission hardware market and expanded our presence in the asia pacific region 
as a result of the acquisition  we added operations in indonesia and malaysia and strengthened our existing positions in australia  thailand  mexico and the united states 

table of contents we apply the purchase method of accounting to our acquisitions pursuant to fasb asc  business combinations 
under this method  we allocate the cost of business acquisitions to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  commonly referred to as the purchase price allocation 
as part of the purchase price allocations for our business acquisitions  identifiable intangible assets are recognized as assets apart from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights  or if they are capable of being separated or divided from the acquired business and sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
the purchase price is allocated to the underlying tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values  with any excess recorded as goodwill 
we determine the fair values of such assets and liabilities  generally in consultation with third party valuation advisors 
such fair value assessments require significant judgments and estimates such as projected cash flows  discount rates  royalty rates and remaining useful lives that can differ materially from actual results 
the current accounting standards requires us to record inventories at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date 
to estimate the fair values of inventories acquired  we estimated the approximate selling price of these inventories and then subtracted the necessary expenses to sell and support the sale of these inventories 
specifically  the estimated selling price of the inventory was estimated by grossing up the inventories book values by an expected gross profit margin 
we then subtract only certain operating expenses that would be incurred to dispose of the inventory items 
the current accounting standards  as previously noted  requires us to report the fair values of acquired tangible and intangible assets at the acquisition date fair value 
in relation to our two most recent acquisitions previously noted  inventories were written up a net amount of million and the acquired intangible assets consisting of customer relationships  trade names  technology  and customer backlog were valued at million 
for the year ended december   our operating income of million was decreased by million for the sales of acquired finished goods inventories that had been recorded at acquisition date fair value coupled with 
million of intangible amortization expense 
also  our operating results will be impacted by 
million as the result of amortizing the fair value of inventories and intangible amortization expense 
operating results were also impacted by acquisition related costs of million for the twelve month period ended december  these costs were for legal  accounting  valuation  other professional services and travel related costs 
these costs were included in general and administrative costs in our statement of consolidated income 
discontinued operatons our consolidated financial statements were impacted by the divestiture of superior modular products smp on may  we sold our smp subsidiary for million  which resulted in a 
million gain  net of tax  and included million to be held in escrow for one year 
we have not provided any significant continuing involvement in the operations of smp after the closing of the sale 
for tax purposes  the sale of smp generated a capital loss  which was not deductible except for amounts used to offset capital gains in and a full valuation allowance was provided against the deferred tax asset on the remaining portion of the capital loss carryover 
the operating results of smp are presented in our statements of consolidated income as discontinued operations  net of tax 
for the year ended december   income from discontinued operation  net of tax was 
million  or 
per diluted share 
market overview our business continues to be concentrated in the energy  communications and solar markets 
during the past several years  industry consolidation continued as distributors and service provider consolidations took place in our major markets 
this trend is expected to continue in the sluggish global economy coupled with a depressed us housing market has and could continue to affect construction projects and negatively impact growth opportunities in our core markets in the us and countries such as spain  poland and great britain where the financial situation is expected to be similar going forward 

table of contents in  we again experienced growth in our energy and solar markets 
we continued to see the investment in renewable energy projects  new transmission grids  new technologies  and upgrading and maintenance of the existing energy infrastructure 
we expect the distribution energy market to be relatively flat in but anticipate continued growth in demand for transmission and fiber optic products 
we believe that the acquisition of dulmison from tyco electronics in december and electropar in july have further contributed to the company s leadership position and will enable the company to enhance the scope of its product lines and the technology it provides to this important market 
dulmison s spacer  spacer damper and stockbridge damper product lines fit well and complement plp s product offerings and enable the company to offer the most comprehensive line of products in the industry 
we further strengthened our overall presence in the asia pacific region with the acquisition of electropar in auckland  new zealand 
electropar is a manufacturer of substation  distribution and transmission products supplying both the australian and new zealand electricity markets 
with demand for electrical power continuing to increase  especially in many fast growing areas of the world  the company s leadership position in the market will enable it to take advantage of prospects for continued growth as the transmission grid is enhanced and extended 
our international business is more concentrated in the energy markets 
historically  our international sales were primarily related to the distribution portion of the energy market but have grown through acquisition and new product development to include a significant contribution from the transmission market 
we believe that we are well positioned to supply the needs of the world s diverse energy market requirements as a result of our strategically located operations and array of product designs and technologies 
the company s communication business in faced challenges throughout the world 
many communications customers cut back on capital and operational spending as the global economic downturn negatively impacted consumer spending on communication services 
the us was hit especially hard as communication carriers diverted operational funds to wireless communication projects where they could realize a faster return on their spending and investments 
also  the broadband stimulus program that was announced early in failed to gain additional traction throughout the year and the administrative burden of the program has further delayed the deployment of funds 
through all of this  the company maintained its focus on the customer and put resources towards new product development efforts 
these efforts were directed at customer premise and demarcation applications which are the final connections between the network and the end consumer 
as economic conditions improve and stimulus funds eventually start flowing into projects  we believe our efforts in these areas will lead to growth in the communications business 
opportunities for growth also look promising in central and south america where deployment of fixed line telecommunications services and broadband penetration rates remain low as a percentage of the total population 
preface our consolidated financial results for the years ended december    and include the financial results of our solar energy operation  direct power and water dpw  acquired on march   belos  in poland  acquired on september   bluesky energy pty ltd 
bluesky a joint venture entered into on may   dulmison  acquired on december   and electropar  acquired on july  our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap 
our discussions of the financial results include non gaap measures primarily the impact of foreign currency and the gain on acquisition of business under fasb asc bargain purchase gain noted below to provide additional information concerning our financial results and provide information that is useful to the assessment of our performance and operating trends

our foreign and us net sales increases were primarily attributable to global business combinations  new business  improving market conditions  particularly outside the us  and favorable foreign currency exchange rates 
our financial statements are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar 
as foreign currencies strengthen against the us dollar  our revenues and costs increase as the foreign currency denominated financial statements translate into more dollars

million compared to excluding the bargain purchase gain from  net income would have increased million compared to despite the global economic conditions  we are seeing an improvement in our global marketplace and our financial condition continues to remain strong 
we continue to generate cash flows from operations  have proactively managed working capital and have controlled capital spending 
we currently have a debt to equity ratio of and can borrow needed funds at an attractive interest rate under our credit facility 
while current worldwide conditions necessitate that we concentrate our efforts on maintaining our financial strength  we believe there are many available opportunities for growth 
we will pursue these opportunities as appropriate in the current environment in order to improve our competitive position in the future

working capital  liquidity and capital resources management assessment of liquidity we measure liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short term and long term operating funding needs  fund additional investments  including acquisitions  and make dividend payments to shareholders 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures  cash dividends  business acquisitions  and access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms 
our investments include expenditures required for equipment and facilities as well as expenditures in support of our strategic initiatives 
in  we used cash of million for capital expenditures and in july  we completed the acquisition of electropar for million in cash and the assumption of certain liabilities

at december   the majority of our cash and cash equivalents are held outside the us we expect accumulated us cash balances will remain outside of the us and that we will meet us liquidity needs through future cash flows  use of us cash balances  external borrowings  or some combination of these sources 
we complete comprehensive reviews of our significant customers and their creditworthiness by analyzing financial statements for customers where we have identified a measure of increased risk

we believe our future operating cash flows will be more than sufficient to cover debt repayments  other contractual obligations  capital expenditures and dividends 
in addition  we believe our borrowing capacity provides substantial financial resources 
we do not believe we would increase our debt to a level that would have a material adverse impact upon results of operations or financial condition

one such lease is for our aircraft with a lease commitment through april under the terms of the lease  we maintain the risk to make up a deficiency from market value attributable to damage  extraordinary wear and tear  excess air hours or exceeding maintenance overhaul schedules required by the federal aviation administration 
at the present time  we believe our risks  if any  to be small because the estimated market value of the aircraft approximates its residual value

actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgment and uncertainties  and potentially may result in materially different outcomes under different assumptions and conditions 

table of contents sales recognition our revenue recognition policies are in accordance with fasb asc  revenue recognition 
we recognize sales when title passes to the customer either when goods are shipped or when they are delivered based on the terms of the sale  there is persuasive evidence of an agreement  the price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
revenue related to shipping and handling costs billed to customers are included in net sales and the related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of products sold 
receivable allowances allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we record estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable based upon the number of days the accounts are past due  the current business environment  and specific information such as bankruptcy or liquidity issues of customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
during  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts of 
million 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents approximately of our trade receivables at december  and reserve for credit memos we maintain an allowance for future sales credits related to sales recorded during the year 
our estimated allowance is based on historical sales credits issued in the subsequent year related to the prior year and any significant open return good authorizations as of the balance sheet date 
our allowance is updated on a quarterly basis 
the reserve for credit memos represents of our trade receivables at december  and less than of our trade receivables at december  excess and obsolescence reserves we provide excess and obsolescence reserves to state inventories at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
we identify inventory items which have had no usage or are in excess of the usages over the historical to months 
a management team with representatives from marketing  manufacturing  engineering and finance reviews these inventory items  determines the disposition of the inventory and assesses the estimated market value based on their knowledge of the product and market conditions 
these conditions include  among other things  future demand for product  product utility  unique customer order patterns or unique raw material purchase patterns  changes in customer and quality issues 
at december  and  the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was and  respectively  of gross inventory 
if the impact of market conditions deteriorates from those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be necessary 
impairment of long lived assets we record impairment losses on long lived assets used in operations when events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired and the discounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying value of those items 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect the best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying value of assets not recoverable is then reduced to fair value 
the estimates of fair value represent the best estimate based on industry trends and reference to market rates and transactions 
goodwill we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology  market comparables  and an overall market capitalization reasonableness test in computing fair value by reporting unit 
we then compare the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value to assess if goodwill has been impaired 
based on the assumptions as to growth  discount rates and the weighting used for each respective valuation methodology  results of the valuations could be significantly changed 
however  we believe that the methodologies and weightings used are reasonable and result in appropriate fair values of the reporting units 

table of contents our measurement date for our annual impairment test is january of each year 
we perform interim impairment tests if trigger events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
there were no trigger events during and as such  only an annual impairment test was performed 
deferred tax assets deferred taxes are recognized at currently enacted tax rates for temporary differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we establish a valuation allowance to record our deferred tax assets at an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
uncertain tax positions we identify tax positions taken on the federal  state  local and foreign income tax returns filed or to be filed 
a tax position can include a reduction in taxable income reported in a previously filed tax return or expected to be reported on a future tax return that impacts the measurement of current or deferred income tax assets or liabilities in the period being reported  a decision not to file a tax return  an allocation or a shift of income between jurisdictions  the characterization of income or a decision to exclude reporting taxable income in a tax return  or a decision to classify a transaction  entity or other position in a tax return as tax exempt 
we determine whether a tax position is an uncertain or a routine business transaction tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained at the full amount upon examination 
under fasb asc formerly fin  tax benefits from uncertain tax positions that reduce our current or future income tax liability  are reported in our financial statements only to the extent that each benefit was recognized and measured under a two step approach 
the first step requires us to assess whether each tax position based on its technical merits and facts and circumstances as of the reporting date  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
the second step measures the amount of tax benefit that we recognize in the financial statements  based on a cumulative probability approach 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold that is not highly certain is measured based on the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority  assuming that the tax authority has examined the position and has full knowledge of all relevant information 
fasb asc requires subjectivity of judgments to identify outcomes and to assign probability in order to estimate the settlement amount 
we provide estimates in order to determine settlement amounts 
during the year ended december   we recognized a benefit of less than 
million of uncertain tax positions 
at december   the total reserve for uncertain tax positions is million 
pensions we record obligations and expenses related to pension benefit plans based on actuarial valuations  which include key assumptions on discount rates  expected returns on plan assets and compensation increases 
these actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually and modified as appropriate 
the effect of modifications is generally recorded or amortized over future periods 
the discount rate of at december  reflects an analysis of yield curves as of the end of the year and the schedule of expected cash needs of the plan 
the expected long term return on plan assets of reflects the plan s historical returns and represents our best estimate of the likely future returns on the plan s asset mix 
we believe the assumptions used in recording obligations under the plans are reasonable based on prior experience  market conditions and the advice of plan actuaries 
however  an increase in the discount rate would decrease the plan obligations and the net periodic benefit cost  while a decrease in the discount rate would increase the plan obligations and the net periodic benefit cost 
in addition  an increase in the expected long term return on plan assets would decrease the net periodic pension cost  while a decrease in expected long term return on plan assets would increase the net periodic pension cost 

table of contents recently adopted accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb updated guidance included in fasb asc  related to the consolidation of variable interest entities 
this guidance will require ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
in addition  this updated guidance amends the quantitative approach for determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity 
fasb asc amends certain guidance for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity and adds additional reconsideration events for determining whether an entity is a variable interest entity 
further  this guidance requires enhanced disclosures that will provide users of financial statements with more transparent information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this updated guidance is effective as of the beginning of the first annual reporting period and interim reporting periods that begin after november  the adoption of this guidance did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic 
this update provides amendments to subtopic and related guidance within us gaap to require disclosure of the transfers in and out of levels and and a schedule for level that separately identifies purchases  sales  issuances and settlements and requires more detailed disclosures regarding valuation techniques and inputs 
we adopted this new standard effective january  and it had no impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures 
recently issued accounting pronouncements changes to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap are established by the fasb in the form of accounting standards updates asu s to the fasb s accounting standards codification 
we consider the applicability and impact of all asu s 
asu s not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or have minimal impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in october  the fasb issued accounting standards update no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu 
asu addresses the accounting for sales arrangements that include multiple products or services by revising the criteria for when deliverables may be accounted for separately rather than as a combined unit 
specifically  this guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable  which is necessary to separately account for each product or service 
this hierarchy provides more options for establishing selling price than existing guidance 
asu is required to be applied prospectively to new or materially modified revenue arrangements in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
we do not expect that the adoption of asu will have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 which updates the guidance in fasb asc topic  business combinations 
the objective of asu is to address diversity in practice about the interpretation of the pro forma revenue and earnings disclosure requirements for business combinations 
the amendments in asu specify that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements  the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments affect any public entity as defined by fasb asc that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
the amendments in asu are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  we believe the adoption of this guidance will not have an impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued asu no 
 which updates the guidance in fasb asc topic  intangibles goodwill other 
the amendments in asu affect all entities that have recognized goodwill and have one or more reporting units whose carrying amount for purposes of performing step of the goodwill impairment test is zero or negative 
the amendments in asu modify step so that for those reporting units  an entity is required to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
in determining whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists  an entity should consider whether there are any adverse qualitative factors indicating that an impairment may exist 
the qualitative factors are consistent with existing guidance  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
this guidance will become effective for us at the beginning of our second quarter of fiscal the adoption of this guidance is not expected to have an impact on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates manufacturing facilities and offices around the world and uses fixed and floating rate debt to finance the company s global operations 
as a result  the company is subject to business risks inherent in non us activities  including political and economic uncertainty  import and export limitations and market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company believes the political and economic risks related to the company s international operations are mitigated due to the stability of the countries in which the company s largest international operations are located 
the company is exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its variable rate revolving credit facilities and term notes  which consisted of borrowings of million at december  a basis point increase in the interest rate would have resulted in an increase in interest expense of approximately 
million for the year ended december  the company s primary currency rate exposures are related to foreign denominated debt  intercompany debt  forward exchange contracts  foreign denominated receivables and cash and short term investments 
a hypothetical change in currency rates would have a favorable unfavorable impact on fair values of million and on income before tax of less than 
million
