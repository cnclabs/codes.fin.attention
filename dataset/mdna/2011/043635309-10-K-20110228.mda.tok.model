overview we are a development stage company formed to commercialize flexible pv modules using our proprietary technology 
for the year ended december   we generated approximately million of revenue 
our 
table of contents revenue from government research and development contracts was million and our revenue from product sales was million 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
currently our fab production line is ramping up production on qualified equipment 
we are qualifying additional equipment that has been delivered and additional equipment is scheduled for delivery in under our current business plan  we expect losses to continue until production reaches an annual rated capacity of approximately mw or more 
to date  we have financed our operations primarily through public and private equity financings 
on november   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock 
the offering price was per share resulting in total net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds from the stock sales are being utilized to fund equipment purchases for fab in thornton  colorado  as well as the funding of negative operating cash flows as we ramp up production levels 
while focused on speed to market  we believe that quality and consistency of product will be paramount to our success in the marketplace 
consequently  we follow a highly disciplined  staged progression based upon the achievement of key milestones and supported by over sixteen years of concerted research and development activity by our scientists 
our progression also takes into account market conditions  as well as financing options 
in keeping with our philosophy  we completed construction of our fab production line in december in march  we demonstrated ioc of the fab production line by initiating production trials as an end to end integrated process 
early ioc production trials resulted in average thin film device efficiencies of and small area monolithically integrated module efficiencies of over 
during  optimization trials resulted in thin film device efficiencies in the to range and corresponding module efficiencies in the to range 
the test modules measured approximately centimeters wide by centimeters long 
during  we focused on testing and qualifying our fab production line in anticipation of commencing production 
during the first quarter of  we began limited production of monolithically integrated flexible cigs modules on our fab production line and continued to provide sample modules to potential customers and development partners to explore integration of our products into new applications 
in june  we announced the fabrication of a five meter long cigs module  which we believe is the largest monolithically interconnected cigs module ever produced on polyimide and possibly the largest cigs module ever produced regardless of construction 
based on internal test and evaluation  this five meter long module weighed approximately two kilograms and produced watts under standard test conditions with an aperture area efficiency of 
in july  we obtained independent verification by nrel that the modules produced from fab measured in conversion efficiency 
the modules tested at nrel were approximately centimeters wide by centimeters long and were produced on the company s fab production line 
in october  nrel verified our achievement of a manufacturing milestone of cell efficiency from fab we also announced a peak efficiency of for cigs modules manufactured at fab in december  we achieved module efficiency on the same by form factor 
in august  we completed internal qualification testing of a flexible packaging solution which successfully passed the rigorous standard of one thousand  hours of damp heat testing relative humidity and c temperature guideline set forth by iec standards for performance and long term reliability of thin film solar modules 
in february  three product configurations were certified by an independent laboratory on a variety of dod rugged standards known as mil std g 
in october  we completed full external certification under iec at an independent laboratory of a two meter module for bapv applications 
achieving this certification is required for bipv bapv applications used in commercial  industrial and residential rooftop markets 
we have submitted two meter and five meter modules for testing under iec  iec  and ul for bapv applications 
these certifications are performance and safety standards for flat plate pv modules intended for installation on or integrated with buildings  or to be freestanding that is  not attached to buildings  in accordance with applicable electrical and building codes 
certification activities will continue as required as we introduce new products and make significant improvements to our already certified products 

table of contents in june  we announced that darpa selected ascent solar for an award under the low cost lightweight pop solicitation 
the ascent solar led program  entitled flexible high performance tandem junction pv array  consists of three gated phases that extend over months 
the total contract value is approximately million 
the goal of pop is to demonstrate low cost  lightweight pv that can stand up to battle conditions and environmental extremes while delivering a power conversion efficiency of or greater by the end of the program 
commercialization and manufacturing expansion plan in  we had product sales of  which was not considered sufficient to exit development stage 
we intend to be the first company to commercialize the manufacture of large  roll format  pv modules that use cigs on a flexible  plastic substrate 
our manufacturing expansion plan entails the design  installation  qualification  testing and operation of additional production tools to increase our rated production capacity 
approximately of the total equipment planned for delivery into fab had been delivered by december  we exited at an annual run rate of approximately mw on equipment with a nameplate or nominal capacity of mw per year 
additional equipment deliveries are planned during we are targeting mw to mw of production in based on market demand for our products 
during  we applied for funding under the doe loan guarantee program for our planned fab production line with a nameplate capacity of mw per year 
the doe reviewed our part i submission under the loan guarantee application innovative energy efficiency  renewable energy and advanced transmission and distribution technologies solicitation no 
de foa  and deemed it responsive to the initial threshold requirements 
we completed our part ii submission under the program in december on february   the doe informed us that our submission was selected for due diligence review by the doe 
if our project is approved by the doe  ground breaking must occur by the federally mandated september  deadline 
we have no assurances that our project will be approved by the doe 
we are evaluating the timing of further expansion based on many factors that include demand  market conditions  product certification  availability of financing  technical advances  strategic partnerships and other factors 
capital equipment expenditures and manufacturing costs since our formation in october  the majority of our cash outlays have gone toward the investment in capital equipment necessary to develop our manufacturing capabilities for producing the commercial products we envision and for research and development 
we expect this trend to continue into as we incrementally expand our rated capacity 
we recently applied for funding under the us department of energy loan guarantee program for our fab production line with a nameplate capacity of mw per year 
we currently expect the capital expenditures for fab to total approximately million to million for manufacturing and development equipment 
we invested approximately million for the acquisition and renovation of the fab manufacturing facility in thornton  colorado 
we also expect capital expenditures of approximately million for installation and qualification of the fab equipment 
as of december   we have made actual cash payments of approximately million for the fab equipment including installation costs and deposits on undelivered equipment 
during we expect to make the remaining payments of approximately million on the fab manufacturing equipment already delivered to our fab location  of which payments in the amount of approximately million have been secured by a letter of credit 
we expect to make payments on equipment for fab of approximately million during during the first quarter of  we began limited production of monolithically integrated flexible cigs modules from our fab production line 
in mid we began initial production of monolithically integrated flexible cigs modules from our fab production plant 
we are continuing the process of qualifying the 
table of contents remaining production tools that have been delivered into fab during  we will be focused on ramping up the equipment already in production and qualification of the equipment in house and to be delivered in the timing and amount of our production capacity and actual output will depend on a number of technical factors such as module efficiency  production yield and throughput 
our projections of annual rated production capacity have been and continue to be based on assumptions about these and other factors 
we periodically revisit and revise these assumptions to account for realized rates and measurements on our production lines 
future production yield and throughput in fab will depend on our continuing efforts to successfully ramp up the production equipment 
we are continuing the process of qualifying the remaining production tools that have been delivered into fab we have additional tools on order that have not been delivered into fab the output of fab in will depend on product demand  market conditions  technical factors  and the timing of the final qualification and delivery of tools into fab we intend to continue to optimize our manufacturing processes including throughput  efficiency and yield to improve product performance and reduce manufacturing costs 
we also intend to identify and evaluate suitable locations for new production lines for future expansion  domestically and abroad  that we believe will best serve our target markets and customers for future expansion 
significant trends  uncertainties and challenges we believe that the significant trends  uncertainties and challenges that directly or indirectly affect our financial performance and results of operations include our ability to qualify production tools to achieve desired production yields  throughput  module efficiencies and other performance targets  and to obtain necessary or desired certifications for our pv modules  in a timely manner  our ability to expand production in accordance with our plans set forth above under commercialization and manufacturing expansion plan  our ability to achieve projected operational performance and cost metrics  our ability to consummate strategic relationships with key partners  including oems  customers  system integrators  value added resellers and distributors who deal directly with manufacturers and end users in the bipv bapv  portable power  eipv and government defense solar panel markets  consumer acceptance of our products  the effect that currency fluctuations may have on our capital equipment purchases  manufacturing costs and the price of our planned pv modules  changes in the supply and demand for pv modules as well as fluctuations in selling prices for pv modules worldwide  our ability to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us  our ability to manage the planned expansion of our manufacturing facilities  operations and personnel  our ability and the ability of our distributors  suppliers and customers to manage operations and orders and timely delivery of production tools  and availability of raw materials 
basis of presentation our activities to date have consisted substantially of raising capital  research and development  establishment of our fab production plant and the development of our fab expansion plant 
revenues to date have been generated primarily from our governmental research and development r d contracts and have not been significant 
our planned principal operations to commercialize flexible pv modules 
table of contents have commenced  but have generated limited revenue to date 
accordingly  we are considered to be in the development stage and have presented our financial statements under the provisions of asc topic development stage entities which requires additional disclosure of inception to date activity in our statements of operations  statements of stockholder s equity and comprehensive income loss and statements of cash flows 
cash equivalents we classify all highly liquid debt securities purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
we maintain cash balances which may exceed federally insured limits 
we do not believe that this results in significant credit risk 
restricted cash we classify all cash or cash items that are legally restricted to usage or withdrawal as restricted cash 
if such funds are to be used to acquire non current assets or to liquidate long term liabilities  they shall be classified as long term in the balance sheets 
funds restricted for the payment of interest  current maturities of debt or other current liabilities shall be classified as current 
investments we classify our investments as available for sale 
such investments are carried at fair value  based on quoted market prices with the unrealized holding gains and losses reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity section of the balance sheets 
realized gains and losses on sales of securities are computed using the specific identification method 
the company evaluates declines in market value for potential impairment 
if the decline results in a value below cost and is determined to be other than temporary  the investment is written down to its impaired value and a new cost basis is established 
fair value estimates the fair value of an asset or liability is the amount at which it could be exchanged or settled in a current transaction between willing parties 
we have recorded investments at fair value and have classified them as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices and other inputs that can be corroborated by observable market data 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset or liability 
the carrying value for cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued property plant  and equipment  accrued expenses and other assets and liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short maturities 
foreign currency translation bank account balances related to our foreign currencies are translated to us dollars utilizing the period end exchange rate 
gains or losses on foreign currency translation adjustments in connection with our forward contracts are recorded within realized gain loss on forward contracts in other income expense on the statements of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from governmental research and development contracts is generated under terms that are cost plus fee or firm fixed price 
revenue from cost plus fee contracts is recognized as costs are incurred on the basis of direct costs plus allowable indirect costs and an allocable portion of the fixed fee 
revenue from firm fixed price contracts is recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting  with costs and estimated profits included in contract revenue as work is performed 
if actual and estimated costs to complete a contract indicate a loss  provision is made currently for the loss anticipated on the contract 
revenue from commercial sales of flexible pv modules is recognized as modules are delivered and title has transferred to the customer 
product revenue through december  is included in research and development revenue as the company is in the development stage and such revenues totaling  for the year ended december  were generated from a limited number of customers as the product is being brought to market 
shipping and handling costs we classify shipping and handling costs for solar modules shipped to our customers as a component of research and development costs 
customer payments of shipping and handling costs are recorded as a component of revenues 

table of contents deferred contract revenue deferred contract revenue is generated from governmental research and development contracts 
the amount deferred represents billings in excess of costs incurred on firm fixed price deliverables 
as of december  and  deferred contract revenue was  and  respectively 
amounts classified in deferred contract revenue are expected to be recognized within one year of the balance sheet date 
receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount as the result of transactions with customers 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate the collectability of our accounts receivable using analysis of historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
necessary reserves are established on an account by account basis 
account balances are written off against the allowance in the period in which we determine that it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered 
product warranties we provide a limited warranty to the original purchaser of our product against defective materials and workmanship 
we also guarantee modules will achieve and maintain the stated conversion efficiency rating 
warranty accruals are recorded at the time of sale and are estimated based upon product warranty terms  historical experience and analysis of peer company product returns 
we assess the adequacy of our liabilities and will make adjustments as necessary based on known or anticipated warranty claims  or as new information becomes available 
patents at such time as we are awarded patents  patent costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the legal life  or over their estimated useful lives  whichever is shorter 
as of december   we had  of net patent costs  of which  represent costs net of amortization incurred for awarded patents  and the remaining  represents costs incurred for patent applications to be filed 
amortization expense was  for the year ending december  and  for each of the years ended december  and inventories all inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined using the weighted average method 
elements of cost include raw material acquisition and conversion costs  an allocated portion of indirect production costs  inventory maintenance costs and depreciation and amortization 
when plant capacity is significantly underutilized  allocated costs included in inventories are based on a normal level of activity  with the excess costs charged to expense in the period incurred 
inventory balances are frequently evaluated to ensure they exceed net realizable value 
the computation for net realizable value takes into account many factors  including expected demand  product lifecycle and development plans  module efficiency  quality issues  obsolescence and others 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventories have a long life cycle and obsolescence is not a significant factor in their valuation 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment are recorded at the original cost to the company 
assets are depreciated over estimated useful lives of three to forty years using the straight line method  as presented in the table below  commencing when the asset is placed in service 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the remainder of the lease term or the life of the improvements 
upon retirement or disposal  the cost of the asset disposed of and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is reflected in income 
expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
useful lives in years buildings manufacturing machinery and equipment furniture  fixtures  computer hardware software leasehold improvements life of lease 
table of contents interest capitalization we capitalize interest cost as part of the historical cost of acquiring or constructing certain assets during the period of time required to get the asset ready for its intended use 
during and  these assets consisted of property  plant and equipment 
we capitalize interest to the extent that expenditures to acquire or construct an asset have occurred and interest cost has been incurred 
long lived assets we analyze long lived tangible assets property  plant and equipment and definitive lived intangible assets patents for impairment by assessing if the asset cost will be recoverable 
events that might cause impairment would include significant current period operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of a long lived asset or group of assets combined with a history of such losses  significant changes in the manner of use of assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
net loss per common share basic earnings per share include no dilution and are computed by dividing income available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period 
diluted earnings per share reflect the potential of securities that could share in our earnings  similar to fully diluted earnings per share 
common stock equivalents consisting of class b warrants  ipo warrants representative warrants  and stock options and unvested restricted stock outstanding as of december  of approximately million shares  have been omitted from loss per share because they are anti dilutive 
net loss per share was the same for both basic and diluted for the periods ended december   and research and development costs research and development costs are incurred during the process of researching and developing new products and enhancing our manufacturing processes and consist primarily of compensation and related costs for personnel  materials  supplies and equipment depreciation 
we expense these costs as incurred until the resulting product has been completed and tested and is ready for commercial manufacturing 
we also incur research and development expenses on federal government research and development contracts and expense as incurred 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided using the liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of the changes in tax laws and rates as of the date of enactment 
interest and penalties  if applicable  would be recorded in operations 
we have analyzed filing positions in all of the federal and state jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns  as well as all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
we believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded 
share based compensation we measure and recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees  officers  directors  and consultants based on estimated fair values 
we estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service period in our statements of operations 
share based compensation is based on awards ultimately expected to vest and is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  as necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
for purposes of determining estimated fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model for option awards 
the black scholes model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
because our employee stock options may have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially 
table of contents affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our employee stock options 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of share based compensation 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies  which could materially impact our fair value determination 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock awards at our stock price on the grant date 
the accounting guidance for share based compensation may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among option valuation models  and this may result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the accounting for share based compensation in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the compensation expense that we record in the future may differ significantly from what it has recorded in the current period and could materially affect our loss from operations  net loss and net loss per share 
comprehensive income loss our comprehensive income loss consists of net income loss and changes in unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investments  the impact of which has been excluded from net loss 
we present comprehensive income loss in the statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss 
our accumulated other comprehensive income loss is presented as a component of equity in the balance sheets and consists of the cumulative amount of unrealized gains or losses on available for sale investments that have been incurred since the inception of our business 
reclassifications certain reclassifications have been made to the and financial information to conform to the presentation 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements 
this asu requires new disclosures and clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurements 
asu requires a reporting entity to disclose significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements  to describe the reasons for the transfers and to present separately information about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements for fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs 
asu is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements  which are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   early adoption is permitted 
the adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued asu  revenue recognition milestone method topic 
this asu requires new disclosures and provides a consistent framework for applying the milestone method of revenue recognition 
asu states that a vendor may recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
determining whether a milestone is substantive is a matter of judgment made at the inception of the arrangement 
asu is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june   early adoption is permitted 
we do not anticipate the adoption of asu to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in august  the fasb issued asu  accounting for technical amendments to various sec rules and schedules

as of december   we had approximately million in cash and investments 
we also had million in restricted cash securing equipment purchases which is included in other assets on the balance sheets 
on november   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock  yielding total net proceeds of approximately million 
we currently expect the cost of fab will total approximately million to million for manufacturing and development equipment 
we invested approximately million for the acquisition of the building and renovation the fab manufacturing facility in thornton  colorado 
we also expect capital expenditures of approximately million for installation and qualification of the fab equipment 
as of december   we have made actual cash payments of approximately million for the fab equipment including installation costs and deposits on undelivered equipment 
during we expect to make the remaining payments of approximately million on the fab manufacturing equipment already delivered to our fab location of which approximately million have been secured by a letter of credit 
we expect to make payments on equipment for fab of approximately million during during the year ended december   the use of cash for operational expenses averaged approximately million per month and was primarily related to pre manufacturing activities  research and development  business development and general corporate expenses 
a significant component of our costs for the year ended december  related to the hiring of additional personnel for operations along with company infrastructure costs to support our expansion 
our operational expenditures will increase in as production increases 
as of december   we had full time employees and approximately contractors provided through an employment services provider 

table of contents we expect our current cash balance to be sufficient to cover its planned capital and operational expenditures for at least the next months based on currently known factors and limited projected revenues 
we expect that we may need to raise additional capital to cover our operating losses and future manufacturing capacity expansion 
the capital markets are currently volatile and there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional capital on acceptable terms or at all 
we currently are pursuing various avenues to obtain additional capital for further expansion and have submitted materials in connection with a loan guarantee program sponsored by the us department of energy for our fab production line with nameplate capacity of mw per year  and may explore raising money in the equity markets 
on january   we filed a shelf registration statement on form s with the sec for the sale of up to million of our securities 
the sec declared the registration statement effective on january  the shelf registration was utilized in connection with our public offering of approximately million shares that closed on november  with gross proceeds of approximately million 
with the shelf registration  we may from time to time sell common stock  preferred stock  warrants or some combination in one or more offerings for up to million  the remaining amount available 
on february   we entered into an at the market equity offering sales agreement pursuant to which we may issue and sell through an agent up to  of our common stock from time to time at prevailing market prices on the nasdaq stock exchange

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk the company is actively engaged in purchasing manufacturing equipment internationally and is exposed to foreign currency risk 
in july and march  the company entered into fair value hedges utilizing forward contracts designed to match scheduled contractual payments to equipment suppliers which are denominated in euros and yen 
the total notional value of the euro forward contracts was million with various contract settlement dates beginning september  through july  the total notional value of the yen forward contracts 
table of contents was million with contract settlement dates of march and april those forward contracts had been settled as of december  and the currencies contracted for were delivered to us  however  not all payments have been made to our equipment suppliers and we continue to have foreign currency risk 
included in cash and cash equivalents is  related to  held as of december  in our bank account for future payments to equipment suppliers 
based on our overall currency rate exposure as of december   a near term appreciation or depreciation in the u 
s dollar  relative to our foreign currencies on deposit  would have a positive or negative impact of approximately million on our results of operations 
although our reporting currency is the us dollar  we may conduct business and incur costs in the local currencies of other countries in which we may operate  make sales and buy materials 
as a result  we are subject to currency translation risk 
further  changes in exchange rates between foreign currencies and the us dollar could affect our future net sales and cost of sales and could result in exchange losses 
our objective is to fix the dollar amount of our foreign currency denominated manufacturing equipment purchases at the time of order 
although our hedging activity described below is designed to fix the dollar amount to be expended  the asset purchased is recorded at the spot foreign currency rate in effect as of the date of the payment to the supplier 
the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate has been reported as a loss on forward contract 
we currently have unhedged open purchase orders to an equipment supplier denominated in yen for approximately million 
a appreciation or depreciation in the us dollar  relative to this purchase obligation  would have a positive or negative impact range of approximately million to million on our future cash flows 
as of december  the company held two forward currency option contracts hedging approximately million in equipment payments to be remitted in yen 
we cannot accurately predict future exchange rates or the overall impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risks for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our cash equivalents and investment portfolio 
as of december   our cash equivalents consisted of money market funds  investments in us government securities and high quality corporate securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and provide liquidity on demand  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
the direct risk to us associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates will have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
credit risk we have certain financial and derivative instruments that potentially subject us to credit risk 
these consist primarily of cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash  investments  and forward foreign currency option contracts 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counter parties to our financial and derivative instruments 
we place cash  cash equivalents  investments and forward foreign currency option contracts with various high quality financial institutions  and exposure is limited at any one institution 
we continuously evaluate the credit standing of our counter party financial institutions
