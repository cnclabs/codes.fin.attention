many of these risks similarly impact our nonreporting subsidiaries 
these and other risk factors are detailed from time to time in the progress registrants filings with the sec 
many  but not all  of the factors that may impact actual results are discussed in item a  risk factors  which should be read carefully 
all such factors are difficult to predict  contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results and may be beyond our control 
new factors emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for management to predict all such factors  nor can management assess the effect of each such factor on the progress registrants 
part i item business general organization progress energy  inc is a public utility holding company primarily engaged in the regulated electric utility business 
headquartered in raleigh  nc  it owns  directly or indirectly  all of the outstanding common stock of its utility subsidiaries  pec and pef 
in this report  progress energy  which includes the parent and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis  is at times referred to as we  our or us 
when discussing progress energy s financial information  it necessarily includes the results of pec and pef collectively  the utilities 
the term progress registrants refers to each of the three separate registrants progress energy  pec and pef 
however  neither of the utilities makes any representation as to information related solely to progress energy or the subsidiaries of progress energy other than itself 
the parent was incorporated on august   initially as cp l energy  inc and became the holding company for pec on june  we acquired pef through our november acquisition of its parent  florida progress corporation florida progress 
our reportable segments are pec and pef  which are primarily engaged in the generation  transmission  distribution and sale of electricity in portions of north carolina and south carolina and in portions of florida  respectively 
the corporate and other segment primarily includes amounts applicable to the activities of the parent and progress energy service company  llc pesc and other miscellaneous nonregulated businesses corporate and other that do not separately meet the quantitative disclosure requirements as a reportable business segment 
see note for information regarding the revenues  income and assets attributable to our business segments 
the utilities have more than  megawatts mw of regulated electric generation capacity and serve approximately million retail electric customers as well as other load serving entities 
we are dedicated to meeting the growth needs of our service territories and delivering reliable  competitively priced energy from a diverse portfolio of power plants 
the utilities operate in retail service territories that have historically had population growth higher than the us average 
however  like other parts of the united states  our service territories and business have been negatively impacted by the current economic conditions 
the timing and extent of the recovery of the economy cannot be predicted 
for the year ended december   our consolidated revenues were billion and our consolidated assets at year end were billion

recent developments on january   duke energy and progress energy entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement 
pursuant to the merger agreement  progress energy will be acquired by duke energy in a stock for stock transaction and continue as a wholly owned subsidiary of duke energy the merger 
both companies boards of directors have unanimously approved the merger agreement 
however  consummation of the merger is subject to customary conditions  including  among other things  approval of the shareholders of each company  expiration or termination of the applicable hart scott rodino act waiting period  and receipt of approval  to the extent required  from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  the federal communications commission  the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  the north carolina utilities commission ncuc  the kentucky public service commission and the south carolina public service commission scpsc  the florida public service commission fpsc  the indiana utility regulatory commission  and the ohio public utilities commission 
see item ia  risk factors  md a introduction merger  and note for additional information related to the merger 
on june   the fpsc approved a settlement agreement between pef and interveners  with the exception of the florida association for fairness in ratemaking  to the rate case and a pef proposed accounting order 
among other provisions  under the terms of the settlement agreement  pef will maintain base rates at current levels through the last billing cycle of the settlement agreement also provides that pef will have the discretion to reduce amortization expense cost of removal component in  and the settlement agreement also provides that if pef s actual retail base rate earnings fall below a percent return on equity roe on an adjusted or pro forma basis  as reported on a historical month basis during the term of the agreement  pef may seek general  limited or interim base rate relief  or any combination thereof 
prior to requesting any such relief  pef must have reflected on its referenced surveillance report associated amortization expense reductions of at least million 
the settlement agreement does not preclude pef from requesting the fpsc to approve the recovery of costs a that are of a type which traditionally and historically would be  have been or are presently recovered through cost recovery clauses or surcharges  or b that are incremental costs not currently recovered in base rates  which the legislature or fpsc determines are clause recoverable  or c which are recoverable through base rates under the nuclear cost recovery legislation or the fpsc s nuclear cost recovery rule 
see note c for additional provisions of the settlement agreement 
in september  pef s nuclear generating unit  crystal river unit no 
cr  began an outage for normal refueling and maintenance as well as its uprate project to increase the unit s generating capability and to replace two steam generators 
during preparations to replace the steam generators  we discovered a delamination within the concrete of the outer wall of the containment structure  which has resulted in an extension of the outage 
we expect to complete repairs in march  and return the unit to service following successful completion of post repair testing and start up activities in april nuclear safety remains our top priority  and our plans and actions will continue to reflect that commitment 
a number of factors affect the return to service date  including regulatory reviews by the nrc and other agencies  emergent work  final engineering designs  testing  weather and other developments 
pef anticipates recovering the costs related to the extended outage through a combination of insurance and customer rates 
see nuclear matters general and note c 
although we have not made a final determination on new nuclear construction  we have taken steps to keep open the option of building one or more plants at shearon harris nuclear plant harris in north carolina and at a greenfield site in levy county  florida levy 
we have focused on levy given the need for more fuel diversity in florida and anticipated federal and state policies to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions  as well as existing state legislative policy  which is supportive of nuclear projects 
pef has received two of the three key approvals with the issuance of a combined license 
col 
by the nrc remaining and entered into an engineering  procurement and construction epc agreement for the two proposed levy units 
as discussed in nuclear matters potential new construction  with the amendment to the epc agreement  pef will postpone major construction activities at levy until after the nrc issues the col 
if the licensing schedule remains on track and if the decision to build is made  the first of pef s two proposed units could be in service in the second unit could be in service months later 
we are preparing for a carbon constrained future given the state  federal and international focus on global climate change 
we are expanding and enhancing our demand side management dsm  energy efficiency ee and energy conservation programs 
in  we accepted a grant from the united states department of energy doe for million in federal matching infrastructure funds in support of our smart grid initiatives 
in addition to providing the utilities real time information about the state of their electric grids  the smart grid transition will enable customers to better understand and manage their energy use  and will provide for more efficient integration of renewable energy resources 
we continue to actively pursue alternative energy projects 
we have executed contracts to purchase mw of electricity generated from solar  biomass and municipal solid waste sources 
we have adopted a major coal to gas modernization strategy whereby the remaining coal fired generating facilities in north carolina that do not have scrubbers would be retired by the end of prior to the end of their useful lives and their approximately  mw of generating capacity replaced with new natural gas fueled facilities 
this will provide rate base growth while reducing our carbon emissions 
after  pec will continue to operate its roxboro  mayo and asheville coal fired plants in north carolina  which have state of the art emission controls 
competition retail competition to our knowledge  there is currently no enacted or proposed legislation in north carolina  south carolina or florida that would give the utilities retail customers the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry 
however  the utilities compete with suppliers of other forms of energy in connection with their retail customers 
although there is no pending legislation at this time  if the retail jurisdictions served by the utilities become subject to deregulation  the recovery of stranded costs could become a significant consideration 
stranded costs primarily include the generation assets of utilities whose value in a competitive marketplace would be less than their current book value  as well as above market purchased power commitments to qualified facilities qfs 
thus far  all states that have passed restructuring legislation have provided for the opportunity to recover a substantial portion of stranded costs 
our largest stranded cost exposure is for pef s purchased power commitments with qfs  under which pef has future minimum expected capacity payments through of billion see notes a and b 
pef was obligated to enter into these contracts under provision of the public utilities regulatory policies act of pef continues to seek ways to address the impact of escalating payments under these contracts 
however  the fpsc allows full recovery of the retail portion of the cost of power purchased from qfs 
pec does not have significant future minimum expected capacity payments under its purchased power commitments with qfs 
wholesale competition the utilities compete with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales and for sales to municipalities and cooperatives 
increased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect the utilities load forecasts  plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues 
wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of the utilities to attract new wholesale customers and to retain current wholesale customers who have existing contracts with pec or pef 
the ferc adopted final rules designed to strengthen the pro forma open access transmission tariff oatt to ensure that it achieves its original purpose of remedying undue discrimination  provide greater specificity in the pro forma oatt to reduce opportunities for the exercise of undue discrimination  make undue discrimination easier to detect  and facilitate the ferc s enforcement  and increase transparency in the rules applicable to planning and use of the transmission system 
one of the most significant revisions to the pro forma oatt relates to the development of consistent methodologies for calculating available transfer capability  which determines whether transmission customers can access alternative power supplies 
other significant revisions include changes to the transmission planning process  reform of energy and generator imbalance penalties  adoption of a conditional firm component to long term point to point transmission service and reform of existing requirements for the provision of redispatch service  reform of rollover rights policy  clarification of tariff ambiguities  and increased transparency and customer access to information 
certain details related to the rules  such as the precise methodology that will be used to calculate available transfer capability  remain to be determined  and thus it is difficult to make a determination of the overall effect of the new rules on the utilities transmission operations or wholesale marketing function 
however  on a preliminary basis  the rule is not anticipated to have a significant impact on the utilities financial results 
nonetheless  the final rule is anticipated to include a wide range of provisions addressing transmission services  and as the new tariff is implemented there is likely to be a significant impact on the utilities transmission operations  planning and wholesale marketing functions 
pec and pef are subject to regulation by the ferc with respect to transmission service  including generator interconnection service for facilities making sales for resale and wholesale sales of electric energy 
ferc has approved  subject to modification  regional grid planning processes covering pec and pef 
pec and pef made compliance filings with ferc in pec received approval from the ferc in january  and pef is still awaiting ferc approval 
the ferc requires that entities desiring to make wholesale sales of electricity at market based rates document that they do not possess market power 
market power is exercised when an entity profitably drives up prices through its control of a single activity  such as electricity generation  where it controls a significant share of the total capacity available to the market 
the ferc has established screening measures for such determinations 
given the difficulty pec believed it would experience in passing one of the screens  pec revised its market based rate tariffs in to restrict pec to sales outside of its control area and peninsular florida  and filed a new cost based tariff for sales within pec s control area 
accordingly  pec and pef make wholesale sales of electricity at cost based rates in areas inside of pec s control area and peninsular florida and at market based rates in areas outside of pec s control area and peninsular florida 
we do not anticipate that the operations of the utilities will be materially impacted by this market based rates decision 
franchise matters pec has nonexclusive franchises with varying expiration dates in most of the municipalities in north carolina and south carolina in which it distributes electricity 
in north carolina  franchises generally continue for years 
in south carolina  franchises continue in perpetuity unless terminated according to certain statutory methods 
the general effect of these franchises is to provide for the manner in which pec occupies rights of way in incorporated areas of municipalities for the purpose of constructing  operating and maintaining an energy transmission and distribution system 
of pec s franchises  the majority covers year periods from the date enacted  and have no specific expiration dates 
of the pec franchise agreements with expiration dates  expire during the period through  and the remaining agreements expire between and pec also provides service within a number of municipalities and in all of the unincorporated areas within its service area without franchise agreements 
pef has nonexclusive franchises with varying expiration dates in of the florida municipalities in which it distributes electricity 
pef also provides service to other municipalities and in all of the unincorporated areas within its service area without franchise agreements 
the general effect of these franchises is to provide for the manner in which pef occupies rights of way in incorporated areas of municipalities for the purpose of constructing  operating and maintaining an energy transmission and distribution system 
the pef franchise agreements cover periods ranging from to years with the majority covering year periods from the date enacted 
of pef s franchise agreements  expire between and  and the remaining agreements expire between and regulatory matters holding company regulation the parent is a registered public utility holding company subject to regulation by the ferc  including provisions relating to the establishment of intercompany extensions of credit  sales  acquisitions of securities and utility assets  and services performed by pesc 
the ferc also has authority over accounting and record retention and cost allocation jurisdiction at the election of the holding company system or the state utility commissions with jurisdiction over its utility subsidiaries 
utility regulation federal regulation the utilities are subject to regulation by a number of federal regulatory agencies  including the doe  the north american electric reliability corporation nerc  the nrc and the united states environmental protection agency epa 
reliability standards the ferc has certified the nerc as the electric reliability organization that will propose and enforce mandatory reliability standards for the bulk power electric system 
included in this certification was a provision for the delegation of authority to audit  investigate and enforce reliability standards in particular regions of the country by entering into delegation agreements with regional entities 
in addition  the regional entities have the ability to formulate additional reliability standards in their respective regions  which are required to supplement and be more stringent than the nerc reliability standards 
the serc reliability corporation serc and the florida reliability coordinating council are the regional entities for pec and pef  respectively 
pec and pef are currently subject to certain reliability standards as registered users  owners and operators of the bulk power electric system 
we expect existing reliability standards to migrate to more definitive and enforceable requirements over time and additional nerc and regional reliability standards to be approved by the ferc in coming years requiring us to take additional steps to remain compliant 
the financial impact of mandatory compliance cannot currently be determined 
failure to comply with the reliability standards could result in the imposition of fines and civil penalties 
if we are unable to meet the reliability standards for the bulk power electric system in the future  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
pec and pef have self reported to the serc and florida reliability coordinating council noncompliances and violations with the voluntary and mandatory standards from time to time 
the noncompliances and violations have led to the development and implementation of mitigation plans at the utilities 
none of the noncompliances or violations noted above nor the costs of executing the mitigation plans are expected to have a significant impact on our overall compliance efforts  results of operations or liquidity 
nuclear the utilities nuclear generating units are regulated by the nrc 
the nrc is responsible for granting licenses for the construction  operation and retirement of nuclear power plants and subjects these plants to continuing review and regulation 
in the event of noncompliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines  set license conditions  shut down a nuclear unit  or take some combination of these actions  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
see nuclear matters 
environmental the utilities are also subject to regulation by the epa 
see environmental 
state regulation pec is subject to regulation in north carolina by the ncuc  and in south carolina by the scpsc 
pef is subject to regulation in florida by the fpsc 
the utilities are regulated by their respective regulatory bodies with respect to  among other things  rates and service for electricity sold at retail  retail cost recovery of unusual or unexpected expenses  such as severe storm costs  and issuances of securities 
the underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital  including equity 
retail rate matters each of the utilities state utility commissions authorizes retail base rates that are designed to provide the respective utility with the opportunity to earn a reasonable rate of return on its rate base  or net investment in utility plant 
these rates are intended to cover all reasonable and prudent expenses of constructing  operating and maintaining the utility system  except those covered by specific cost recovery clauses 
in pec s most recent rate cases in  the ncuc and the scpsc each authorized a roe of percent 
in pef s most recent rate case settlement agreement approved by the fpsc in  the fpsc authorized pef the opportunity to earn a roe of up to percent 
on september   the fpsc approved a reduction to pef s afudc rate  from percent to percent  based on pef s updated authorized roe 
this new rate will be used for all purposes except for nuclear recoveries with original need petitions submitted on or before december   as permitted by fpsc regulations 
retail cost recovery clauses each of the utilities state utility commissions allows recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses  to the extent the respective commission determines in an annual hearing that such costs  including any past over or under recovered costs  are prudent 
the clauses are in addition to the utilities approved base rates 
the utilities generally do not earn a return on the recovery of eligible operating expenses under such clauses  however  in certain jurisdictions  the utilities may earn interest on under recovered costs 
additionally  the commissions may authorize a return for specified investments for energy efficiency and conservation  capacity costs  environmental compliance and utility plant 
see md a regulatory matters and recovery of costs for additional discussion regarding cost recovery clauses 
costs recovered by the utilities through cost recovery clauses  by retail jurisdiction  were as follows north carolina retail fuel costs  the fuel and other portions of purchased power capacity costs for purchases from dispatchable qfs are also recoverable  costs of new dsm and ee programs  costs of commodities such as ammonia and limestone used in emissions control technologies reagents  and eligible renewable energy costs  south carolina retail fuel costs  certain purchased power costs  costs of reagents  sulfur dioxide so and nitrogen oxides nox emission allowance expenses  and costs of new dsm and ee programs  and florida retail fuel costs  purchased power costs  capacity costs  qualified nuclear costs  energy conservation expense and specified environmental costs  including clean air interstate rule cair compliance costs  and so and nox emission allowance expenses 
fuel  fuel related costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by the utilities 
the utilities use coal  oil  hydroelectric pec only  natural gas and nuclear power to generate electricity  thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel 
due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery  changes in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of the utilities  unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent 
however  delays between the expenditure for fuel costs and recovery from ratepayers can adversely impact the timing of cash flow of the utilities 
pef is obligated to file for a midcourse recovery between annual fuel hearings in the event its estimated over or under recovery of fuel costs meets or exceeds a threshold of percent of estimated total retail fuel revenues and  accordingly  has the ability to mitigate the cash flow impacts due to the timing of recovery of fuel and purchased power costs 
renewable energy and energy efficiency standards pec is allowed to recover the costs of dsm and ee programs in north carolina and south carolina through an annual dsm and ee clause in each jurisdiction 
pec is allowed to capitalize dsm and ee costs intended to produce future benefits 
in addition  the ncuc and the scpsc have approved other forms of financial incentives for dsm and ee programs  including the recovery of net lost revenues and a performance incentive 
dsm programs include  but are not limited to  any program or initiative that shifts the timing of electricity use from peak to nonpeak periods and includes load management  electricity system and operating controls  direct load control  interruptible load and electric system equipment and operating controls 
ee programs include any equipment  physical or program change implemented after january   that results in less energy used to perform the same function 
pec has implemented a series of dsm and ee programs and will continue to pursue additional programs  which must be approved by the respective utility commissions 
we cannot predict the outcome of dsm and ee filings currently pending approval or whether the implemented programs will produce the expected operational and economic results 
pec is subject to renewable energy standards at the state level in north carolina 
north carolina s renewable energy and energy efficiency portfolio standard nc reps establishes minimum standards for the use of energy from specified renewable energy resources or implementation of energy efficiency measures by the state s electric utilities beginning with a percent requirement in and increasing to percent in for regulated public utilities  including pec 
the premium to be paid by electric utilities to comply with the requirements above the cost they would have otherwise incurred to meet consumer demand is to be recovered through an annual clause 
the annual amount that can be recovered through the nc reps clause is capped and once a utility has expended monies equal to the cap  the utility is deemed to have met its obligations  regardless of the actual renewables generated or purchased 
the ncuc has the authority to modify or alter the nc reps requirements if the ncuc determines it is in the public interest to do so 
florida energy law enacted in includes provisions for development of a renewable portfolio standard for florida utilities 
the fpsc provided a draft florida renewable portfolio standard rule with a goal of percent renewable energy production by to the florida legislature in february  but the legislature has not taken action on the draft rule 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
until the rulemaking processes are completed  we cannot predict the costs of complying with the law  but pef would be able to recover its reasonable and prudent compliance costs 
on december   the fpsc ordered pef to adopt dsm goals based on enhanced measures  which will result in significantly higher conservation goals 
as subsequently revised by the fpsc in  pef s aggregate conservation goals over the next years are  summer mw   winter mw  and  gigawatt hours gwh 
pef filed a revised proposed dsm plan on november   which would result in  gwh of energy savings from  seven times more than pef s historic goals 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
see note for further discussion of regulatory matters 
nuclear matters general the nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long term availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste  compliance with changing regulatory requirements  capital outlays for modifications and new plant construction  the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning plants at the end of their licensed lives and requirements relating to nuclear insurance 
nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages  repairs  uprates and certain other modifications 
pec owns and operates four nuclear generating units brunswick nuclear plant brunswick unit no 
and unit no 
 harris  and robinson nuclear plant robinson 
the nrc has renewed the operating licenses for all of pec s nuclear plants 
the renewed operating licenses for brunswick no 
and no 
 harris and robinson expire in september  december  october and july  respectively 
pef owns and operates one nuclear generating unit  cr the nrc operating license for cr currently expires in december on march   the nrc docketed  or accepted for review  pef s application for a year renewal on the operating license for cr  which  if approved  would extend the operating license through  the current useful life used by the fpsc in base rates 
the license renewal application for cr is currently under review by the nrc with a decision expected in over time  pec and pef have made various modifications to their nuclear facilities to increase the energy output 
during cr s fueling and maintenance outage that began in september  pef commenced a project to replace cr s steam generators 
during preparations to replace the steam generators  we discovered a delamination within the concrete of the outer wall of the containment structure 
after a comprehensive analysis  we have determined that the concrete delamination at cr was caused by redistribution of stresses in the containment wall that occurred when we created an opening to accommodate the replacement of the unit s steam generators 
we expect to complete repairs in march  and return the unit to service following successful completion of post repair testing and start up activities in april nuclear safety remains our top priority  and our plans and actions will continue to reflect that commitment 
a number of factors affect the return to service date  including regulatory reviews by the nrc and other agencies  emergent work  final engineering designs  testing  weather and other developments 
pef maintains insurance coverage against incremental costs of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages as well as accidental property damage 
pef s insurer has confirmed that the cr delamination event is a covered accident 
pef is working with its insurer for recovery of applicable repair costs and replacement power 
see note c 
the nrc periodically issues bulletins and orders addressing industry issues of interest or concern that necessitate a response from the industry 
it is our intent to comply with and to complete required responses in a timely and accurate manner 
any potential impact to company operations will vary and will be dependent upon the nature of the requirement s 
potential new construction while we have not made a final determination on new nuclear construction  we continue to take steps to keep open the option of building one or more plants 
during  pec and pef filed col applications to potentially construct new nuclear plants in north carolina and florida 
the nrc estimates that it will take approximately three to four years to review and process the col applications 
we have focused on pef s potential construction at levy given the need for more fuel diversity in florida and anticipated federal and state policies to reduce ghg emissions as well as existing state legislative policy that is supportive of nuclear projects 
levy in  we announced that pef selected a greenfield site at levy to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion 
we selected the westinghouse electric ap reactor design as the technology upon which to base pef s application submission 
in  pef completed the purchase of approximately  acres for levy and associated transmission needs 
in  the fpsc issued a final order granting pef s petition for a determination of need for levy 
in  the power plant siting board  comprised of the governor and the cabinet  issued the levy site certification that addresses permitting  land use and zoning  and property interests and replaces state and local permits 
certification grants approval for the location of the power plant and its associated facilities such as roadways and electrical transmission lines carrying power to the electrical grid  among others 
certification does not include licenses required by the federal government 
on july   pef filed its col application with the nrc for two reactors  which was docketed  or accepted for review  by the nrc on october  docketing the application does not preclude additional requests for information as the review proceeds  nor does it indicate whether the nrc will issue the license 
on february   pef received the nrc s schedule for review and approval of the col 
one joint petition to intervene in the licensing proceeding was filed with the nrc within the day notice period by the green party of florida  the nuclear information and resource service and the ecology party of florida 
on april   the atomic safety licensing board aslb heard oral arguments on whether any of the joint interveners proposed contentions will be admitted in the levy col proceeding 
on july   the aslb issued a decision accepting three of the contentions submitted 
the admitted contentions involved questions about the potential safety and environmental impact of storage of low level radioactive waste  the potential impacts of plant construction and operation on the aquifer and surrounding waters and the potential impact of salt water drift from cooling tower operation 
in april  the aslb dismissed the contention regarding the safety of storage of low level radioactive waste  however  interveners have resubmitted their contention regarding the potential safety of storage of low level waste  which is being considered by the aslb 
pef s appeal of the aslb s decision was denied and a hearing on the remaining contentions will be conducted in other col applicants have received similar petitions raising similar potential contentions 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
pef also completed and submitted a limited work authorization request for levy concurrent with the col application 
pef s initial schedule anticipated performing certain site work pursuant to the limited work authorization prior to col receipt 
however  in  the nrc staff determined that certain schedule critical work that pef had proposed to perform within the scope of the limited work authorization will not be authorized until the nrc issues the col 
consequently  excavation and foundation preparation work will be shifted until after col issuance 
this factor alone resulted in a minimum month schedule shift later than the projected in service dates for units no 
and no 
of june and june  respectively  included in the petition for a determination of need 
subsequent changes in regulatory and economic conditions have resulted in additional schedule shifts 
these conditions include the permitting and licensing process  national and state economic conditions  recent fpsc dsm goals and the resulting impact on ratepayers  and other fpsc decisions 
uncertainty regarding pef s access to capital on reasonable terms  its ability to secure joint owners and increasing uncertainty surrounding carbon regulation and its costs could be other factors to affect the levy schedule 
as disclosed in pef s nuclear cost recovery filing  the schedule shifts will reduce the near term capital expenditures for the project and also reduce the near term impact on customer rates see note c 
pef will postpone major construction activities on the project until after the nrc issues the col  which is expected to be in if the current licensing schedule remains on track 
the schedule shifts will also allow more time for certainty around federal climate change policy 
we believe that continuing  although at a slower pace than initially anticipated  is a reasonable and prudent course at this early stage of the project 
taking into account cost  potential carbon regulation  fossil fuel price volatility and the benefits of fuel diversification  we consider levy to be pef s preferred baseload generation option 
along with the fpsc s annual prudence reviews  we will continue to evaluate the project on an ongoing basis based on certain criteria  including  but not limited to  public  regulatory and political support  adequate financial cost recovery mechanisms  adequate levels of joint owner participation  customer rate impacts  project feasibility  including comparison to other generation options  dsm and ee programs  and availability and terms of capital financing 
if the licensing schedule remains on track and if the decision to build is made  the first of the two proposed units could be in service in the second unit could be in service months later 
pef signed the epc agreement on december   with westinghouse electric company llc and stone webster  inc for two westinghouse ap nuclear units to be constructed at levy 
more than half of the approximate billion contract price is fixed or firm with agreed upon escalation factors 
the epc agreement includes various incentives  warranties  performance guarantees  liquidated damage provisions and parent guarantees designed to incent the contractor to perform efficiently 
for termination without cause  the epc agreement contains exit provisions with termination fees  which may be significant  that vary based on the termination circumstances 
we executed an amendment to the epc agreement in due to the schedule shifts previously discussed 
additionally  in light of the schedule shifts in the levy nuclear project  pef may incur fees and charges related to the disposition of outstanding purchase orders on long lead time equipment for the levy nuclear project  which could be material 
in june  pef completed its long lead time equipment disposition analysis to minimize the impact associated with the schedule shift 
as a result of the analysis  pef will continue with selected components of the long lead time equipment 
work has been suspended on the remaining long lead time equipment items and pef has been in suspension negotiations with the selected equipment vendors  which we anticipate concluding by the end of the first quarter of in its nuclear cost recovery filing  approved by the fpsc on october   pef included for rate making purposes a point estimate of potential levy disposition fees and charges of million  subject to true up 
however  the amount of disposition fees and charges  if any  cannot be determined until suspension negotiations are completed 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
the total escalated cost for the two generating units was estimated in pef s petition for the determination of need for levy to be approximately billion 
this total cost estimate included land  plant components  financing costs  construction  labor  regulatory fees and the initial core for the two units 
an additional billion was estimated for the necessary transmission equipment and approximately miles of transmission lines associated with the project 
pef s nuclear cost recovery filing included an updated analysis that demonstrated continued feasibility of the levy project with pef s current estimated range of total escalated cost  including transmission  of billion to billion 
the filed estimated cost range primarily reflects cost escalation resulting from the schedule shifts 
many factors will affect the total cost of the project and once pef receives the col  it will further refine the project timeline and budget 
as previously discussed  we will continue to evaluate the levy project on an ongoing basis 
florida regulations allow investor owned utilities such as pef to recover the retail portion of prudently incurred site selection costs  preconstruction costs and the carrying cost on construction cost balances of a nuclear power plant prior to commercial operation 
the costs are recovered on an annual basis through the capacity cost recovery clause ccrc 
such amounts will not be included in a utility s rate base when the plant is placed in commercial operation 
the nuclear cost recovery rule also has a provision to recover costs should the project be abandoned after the utility receives a final order granting a determination of need 
these costs include any unrecovered retail portion of construction work in progress at the time of abandonment and any other prudent and reasonable exit costs 
in addition  the rule requires the fpsc to conduct an annual prudence review of the reasonableness and prudence of all such costs  including construction costs  and such determination shall not be subject to later review except upon a finding of fraud  intentional misrepresentation or the intentional withholding of key information by the utility see note c 
harris in  we announced that pec selected a site at harris to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion 
we selected the westinghouse electric ap reactor design as the technology upon which to base pec s application submission 
on february   pec filed its col application with the nrc for two additional reactors at harris  which the nrc docketed on april  no petitions to intervene have been admitted in the harris col application 
if we receive approval from the nrc and applicable state agencies  and if the decision to build is made  a new plant would not be online until the middle of the next decade 
pec s jurisdictions also have laws regarding nuclear baseload generation 
south carolina law includes provisions for cost recovery mechanisms associated with nuclear baseload generation 
north carolina law authorizes the ncuc to allow annual prudence reviews of baseload generating plant construction costs and inclusion of construction work in progress in rate base with corresponding rate adjustment in a general rate case while a baseload generating plant is under construction 
security the nrc issues orders with regard to security at nuclear plants in response to new or emerging threats 
the most recent orders include additional restrictions on nuclear plant access  increased security measures at nuclear facilities and closer coordination with our partners in intelligence  military  law enforcement and emergency response at the federal  state and local levels 
we are working to complete the requirements as outlined in the orders by november  as the nrc  other governmental entities and the industry continue to consider security issues  it is possible that more extensive security plans could be required 
spent fuel and other high level radioactive waste the nuclear waste policy act of as amended provides the framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities for high level radioactive waste materials 
the nuclear waste policy act of promotes increased usage of interim storage of spent nuclear fuel at existing nuclear plants 
we will continue to maximize the use of spent fuel storage capability within our own facilities for as long as feasible 
under federal law  the doe is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste 
we have contracts with the doe for the future storage and disposal of our spent nuclear fuel 
delays have occurred in the doe s proposed permanent repository to be located at yucca mountain  nev 
see note c for information about the complaint filed by the utilities in the united states court of federal claims against the doe for its failure to fulfill its contractual obligation to receive spent fuel from nuclear plants 
failure to open the yucca mountain or another facility would leave the doe open to further claims by utilities 
until the doe begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel  the utilities will continue to safely manage their spent nuclear fuel 
with certain modifications and additional approvals by the nrc  including the installation and or expansion of on site dry cask storage facilities at robinson  brunswick and cr  the utilities spent nuclear fuel storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space for spent fuel generated by their respective systems through the expiration of the operating licenses  including any license renewals  for their nuclear generating units 
harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license 
decommissioning in the utilities retail jurisdictions  provisions for nuclear decommissioning costs are approved by the respective state utility commissions and are based on site specific estimates that include the costs for removal of all radioactive and other structures at the site 
in the wholesale jurisdiction  the provisions for nuclear decommissioning costs are approved by the ferc 
a condition of the operating license for each unit requires an approved plan for decontamination and decommissioning 
see note c for a discussion of the utilities nuclear decommissioning costs 
environmental general we are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local authorities in the areas of air quality  water quality  control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes  and other environmental matters 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to our business and operations and believe we have all necessary permits to conduct such operations 
environmental laws and regulations frequently change and the ultimate costs of compliance cannot be precisely estimated 
the current estimated capital costs associated with compliance with pollution control laws and regulations that we expect to incur are included within md a liquidity and capital resources capital expenditures 
the foundation for progress energy s environmental leadership strategy begins with its environmental management system 
under the environmental management system  the environmental  health and safety performance council  which is comprised of senior executives  provides overall strategic direction  guides corporate environmental policy  monitors environmental regulatory compliance and approves targets that measure  track and drive performance 
our environmental activities are reported to our board of directors operations and nuclear oversight committee 
the committee is responsible for climate change oversight and strategy and  therefore  assesses our plans and activities and makes recommendations to the full board regarding these matters 
we have established a process to identify environmental risks  take prompt action to address these issues and ensure appropriate senior management oversight on a routine basis 
hazardous and solid waste management the provisions of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  authorize the epa to require the cleanup of hazardous waste sites 
this statute imposes retroactive joint and several liability 
some states  including north carolina  south carolina and florida  have similar types of statutes 
we are periodically notified by regulators  including the epa and various state agencies  of our involvement or potential involvement in sites that may require investigation and or remediation 
there are presently several sites with respect to which we have been notified of our potential liability by the epa  the state of north carolina  the state of florida or potentially responsible parties prp groups 
various organic materials associated with the production of manufactured gas  generally referred to as coal tar  are regulated under federal and state laws 
pec and pef are each prps at several manufactured gas plant mgp sites 
we are also currently in the process of assessing potential costs and exposures at other sites 
these costs are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses see notes and 
both pec and pef evaluate potential claims against other prps and insurance carriers and plan to submit claims for cost recovery where appropriate 
the outcome of potential and pending claims cannot be predicted 
while we accrue for probable costs that can be reasonably estimated  based upon the current status of some sites  not all costs can be reasonably estimated or accrued and actual costs may materially exceed our accruals 
material costs in excess of our accruals could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
hazardous and solid waste management matters are discussed in detail in note a 
global climate change global climate change is one of the primary corporate environmental risks identified by our environmental management system 
our risks associated with climate change are discussed under item a  risk factors 
growing state  federal and international attention to global climate change may result in the regulation of carbon dioxide co and other ghgs 
the epa has announced a schedule for development of a new source performance standard for new and existing fossil fuel fired electric utility units 
under the schedule  the epa will propose the standard by july and issue the final rule by may the full impact of regulation under ghg initiatives and final legislation  if enacted  cannot be determined at this time  however  we anticipate that it could result in significant rate increases over time to recover the costs of compliance 
as previously discussed under recent developments  we are preparing for a carbon constrained future and are actively engaged in helping shape effective policies to address the issue 
we are taking steps to address global climate change by changing the way we generate electricity through our balanced solution strategy of ee  alternative energy and a state of the art power system as discussed in md a other matters energy demand 
we continuously evaluate new generation options to determine if they are cost effective for the southeastern united states where our operations are located 
see note and md a other matters environmental matters for additional discussion of our environmental matters  including specific environmental issues  the status of the issues  accruals associated with issue resolutions and our associated exposures 
employees at february   we employed approximately  full time employees 
of this total  approximately  employees at pef are represented by the international brotherhood of electrical workers ibew 
the three year labor contract with the ibew expires in december contract negotiations are expected to begin in the fall of we cannot predict the outcome of the contract negotiations 
we consider our relationship with employees  including those covered by collective bargaining agreements  to be good 
we have a noncontributory defined benefit retirement pension plan for substantially all full time employees and an employee stock ownership plan among other employee benefits 
we also provide contributory postretirement benefits  including certain health care and life insurance benefits  for substantially all retired employees 
at february   pec and pef employed approximately  and  full time employees  respectively 
seasonality and the impact of weather seasonal differences in the weather affect demand for electricity 
the utilities experience higher demand during the summer and winter months 
as a result  our overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis 
beyond the impact of seasonality  deviations from normal weather conditions can significantly affect our financial performance 
our residential and commercial customers are most impacted by weather 
industrial customers are less weather sensitive 
we define normal weather conditions as the long term average of actual historical weather conditions 
the number of years used to calculate normal weather is determined by management and differs by jurisdiction 
we estimate the impact of weather on our earnings based on the number of customers  temperature variances from a normal condition and the amount of electricity the average residential  commercial and some governmental customers historically demonstrated to use per degree day 
our methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not and cannot consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity and relative temperature changes 
the precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long term weather trends to shorter term periods 
degree day data are used to estimate the energy required to maintain comfortable indoor temperatures based on each day s average temperature 
heating degree days measure the variation in the weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature and cooling degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent to which the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature 
each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling degree day 
pec s base temperature for heating and cooling degree days is fahrenheit for all customer classes 
pef s base temperatures vary by customer class  ranging from to fahrenheit for cooling degree days and to fahrenheit for heating degree days

we may be unable to obtain the approvals required to complete our merger with duke energy or  obtaining required governmental and regulatory approvals may require the combined company to comply with restrictions or conditions that may materially impact the anticipated benefits of the merger 
on january   we announced the execution of a definitive merger agreement with duke energy 
before the merger may be completed  shareholder approval must be obtained by both companies 
in addition  various filings must be made with the ncuc  the scpsc  the kentucky public service commission  the ferc  the nrc and various utility regulatory  antitrust and other regulatory authorities in the united states 
these governmental authorities may impose conditions on the completion  or require changes to the terms  of the merger  including restrictions or conditions on the business  operations  or financial performance of the combined company following consummation that may materially impact the anticipated benefits of the merger 
these conditions or changes could have the effect of delaying completion of the merger or imposing additional costs on or limiting the revenues of the combined company following the merger  which could have a material adverse effect on the financial results of the combined company and or cause either party to abandon the merger 
we are also subject to the risk that a required condition to the merger may not be satisfied 
both companies are targeting to complete the merger in but are subject to uncertainties related to the timing needed to consummate the merger 
in the event that the merger agreement is terminated prior to the completion of the merger  we could incur significant transaction costs that could materially impact our financial performance and results 
failure to complete the merger could also negatively impact our stock price and our future business and financial results 
we will incur significant merger transaction costs  including legal  accounting  financial advisory  filing  printing and other costs relating to the merger 
if the merger is not completed  depending upon the reasons for not completing the merger  including whether we have received or entered into a competing takeover proposal  we may be required to pay duke energy a termination fee of million 
the occurrence of either of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse affect on our financial results 
if completed  our merger with duke energy may not achieve the anticipated results and benefits 
we and duke energy entered into the merger agreement with the expectation that the merger would result in various benefits  including  among other things  cost savings and operating efficiencies primarily relating to the regulated businesses 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger is subject to a number of uncertainties  including whether our businesses and the businesses of duke energy can be integrated in an efficient  effective and timely manner 
as noted above  as a result of obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals  certain restrictions or conditions may be imposed on the combined company that materially impact or limit the benefits anticipated by us as a result of the merger 
the combined company is also subject to the risk that the expected cost savings and operational synergies may not be fully realized 
failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs  decreases in the amount of expected liquidity provided by the combined company and diversion of management time and energy and could have an adverse effect on the combined company business  financial results and prospects 
we will be subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the merger with duke energy is pending that could adversely affect our financial results 
uncertainty about the effect of the merger on employees or suppliers may have an adverse effect on us 
although we intend to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects  these uncertainties may impair our ability to attract  retain and motivate key personnel until the merger is completed and for a period of time thereafter  and could cause suppliers and others that deal with us to seek to change existing business relationships 
employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the merger  as employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company 
if  despite our retention and recruiting efforts  key employees depart or fail to accept employment with us because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company  our business operations and financial results could be adversely affected 
merger and integration related issues will place a significant burden on management and internal resources 
the diversion of management time on merger related issues could affect our financial results 
in addition  the merger agreement restricts us  without duke energy consent  from making certain acquisitions and taking other specified actions  including limiting our total capital spending  limiting the extent to which we can obtain financing through long term debt and equity issuances or increasing the parent s common stock dividend rate until the merger occurs or the merger agreement terminates 
these restrictions may prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to our business prior to consummation of the merger or termination of the merger agreement 
unless the merger agreement is terminated earlier  we and duke energy will each have the right to terminate the merger agreement if the merger has not been completed by january  which date is subject to extension under certain circumstances 
we are subject to fluid and complex government regulations that may have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to comprehensive regulation by multiple federal  state and local regulatory agencies  which significantly influences our operating environment and may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers 
we are required to comply with numerous laws and regulations and to obtain numerous permits  approvals  and certificates from the governmental agencies that regulate various aspects of our business  including customer rates  retail service territories  reliability of our transmission system  applicable renewable energy and energy efficiency standards  environmental compliance  issuances of securities  asset acquisitions and sales  accounting policies and practices  and the operation of generating facilities 
we believe the necessary permits  approvals and certificates have been obtained for our existing operations and that our business is conducted in accordance with applicable laws 
changes in laws and regulations as well as changes in federal administrative policy are ongoing and the ultimate costs of compliance cannot be precisely estimated 
such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations  particularly if the costs of those changes are not fully recoverable from our ratepayers 
the rates that pec and pef may charge retail customers for electric power are subject to the authority of state regulators 
accordingly  our profit margins and ability to earn an adequate return on investment could be adversely affected if we do not control and prudently manage costs to the satisfaction of regulators  or if we do not obtain successful outcomes in our regulatory proceedings 
such regulatory decisions may be impacted by economic and public policy considerations within the respective jurisdictions 
the ncuc  the scpsc and the fpsc each exercise regulatory authority for review and approval of the retail electric power rates charged within its respective state 
the utilities state utility commissions approve base rates  which by law must give a utility a reasonable opportunity to recover its operating costs and return on invested capital 
they also approve recovery through cost recovery clauses of certain additional costs  known as pass through costs  which vary by jurisdiction  examples include fuel costs  certain purchased power costs  qualified nuclear costs and specified environmental costs 
the commissions can disagree with our request of appropriate base rates  and can disallow either requested base rates or pass through recoveries on the grounds that such costs were not reasonable and prudent 
the utilities expect increased future expenditures in several key areas including  but not limited to  environmental compliance  new and existing generation  transmission and distribution facilities  renewable energy and energy efficiency standards compliance as applicable  dsm programs and fuel and other commodities 
such cost increases will be subject to scrutiny from regulators  policymakers and ratepayers 
as referenced above  the commissions may disallow any costs that they find unreasonable and imprudent 
our financial performance depends on the successful operation of electric generating facilities by the utilities and their ability to deliver electricity to customers 
operating our electric generating facilities and delivery systems involves many risks  including operator error and breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  including repair and replacement power costs  failure of information technology systems and network infrastructure  operational limitations imposed by environmental or other regulatory requirements  limitations imposed on our nuclear generating units by regulatory agencies or a failure to obtain required licenses for our nuclear generating units  as discussed later  inadequate or unreliable access to transmission and distribution assets  labor disputes and inability to recruit and retain skilled technical workers  inability to successfully and timely execute repair  maintenance and or refueling outages  interruptions to the supply of fuel and other commodities used in generation  failure to comply with ferc mandated reliability standards for the bulk power electric system  inadequate coal combustion product management disposal or beneficial use capabilities  failure to adequately forecast system requirements and commodity requirements  and catastrophic events such as hurricanes  floods  extreme drought  earthquakes  fires  explosions  terrorist attacks  pandemic health events or other similar occurrences 
occurrences of these events could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
a significant portion of our generating facilities was constructed many years ago 
aging equipment  even if maintained in accordance with industry practices  may require significant capital expenditures 
failure of equipment or facilities could potentially increase o m expense  purchased power expenses and capital expenditures 
meeting the anticipated demand in our service territories and fulfilling our environmental compliance strategies will require  among other things  modernization of coal generating facilities  the construction of new generating facilities and the siting and construction of associated transmission facilities 
we may not be able to obtain required licenses  permits and rights of way  successfully and timely complete construction  or recover the cost of such new generation and transmission facilities through our base rates or other recovery mechanisms  any of which could adversely impact our financial condition  cash flows or results of operations 
meeting the anticipated demand within the utilities service territories and complying with existing and potential environmental laws and regulations will require a balanced approach 
the three main elements of this balanced solution are expanding our energy efficiency programs  investing in the development of alternative energy resources for the future  and operating state of the art power systems that produce energy cleanly and efficiently by modernizing existing plants and pursuing options for building new plants and associated transmission facilities 
the risks of each of the elements of our balanced solution include  but are not limited to  the following energy efficiency and new energy resources we are expanding our dsm  energy efficiency and conservation programs and will continue to pursue additional initiatives as these programs can be effective ways to reduce energy costs  offset the need for new power plants and protect the environment 
we are subject to the risk that our customers may not participate in our conservation programs or that the results from these programs may be less than anticipated 
this could impact our compliance with state mandated energy efficiency standards as discussed in the risks regarding renewable energy standards 
also  not achieving the energy efficiency and conservation measurements we assumed in our long term resource planning could require us to further expand our generation capacity or purchase additional power at prevailing market rates 
we are also subject to the risk that customer participation in these programs or new technologies that impact the quantity and pattern of electricity usage may decrease our electric sales and require us to seek future rate increases to cover our prudently incurred costs 
as discussed further in the risk factor related to renewable energy standards  we are actively engaged in a variety of alternative energy projects 
these alternative energy projects may be determined to not be cost efficient or cost effective 
modernization and construction of generating plants we are currently evaluating our options for new generating plants  including gas and nuclear technologies 
we intend to retire certain coal fired units in north carolina that do not have emission control equipment by the end of and to construct new natural gas fueled units at certain of these facilities 
we are also evaluating the possibility of converting certain of these facilities to be fueled by natural gas or biomass 
at this time  no definitive decision has been made regarding the construction of nuclear plants 
decisions to build new power plants and successful completion of such construction projects are based on many factors including projected system load growth  performance of existing generation fleet  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources  projections of fuel prices  availability and security  the regulatory environment  including the ability to recover costs and earn an appropriate return on investment  operational performance of new technologies  the time required to permit and construct  environmental impact  both public and policymaker support  including support for siting of power plant and associated transmission  siting and construction of transmission facilities  cost and availability of construction equipment  materials and skilled labor  nuclear decommissioning costs  insurance  and costs of security  ability to obtain financing on favorable terms  and availability of adequate water supply 
there is no assurance that we will be able to successfully and timely construct new generating facilities or to expand or modernize existing facilities within our projected budgets or that those expenditures will be recoverable through our base rates or other recovery mechanisms 
as with any major construction undertaking  completion could be delayed or prevented  or cost overruns could be incurred  as a result of numerous factors  including shortages of material and labor  labor disputes  weather interferences  difficulties in obtaining necessary licenses or permits or complying with license or permit conditions  and unforeseen engineering  environmental or geological problems 
these construction projects are long term and may involve facility designs that have not been previously constructed or that have not been finalized when that project is commenced 
consequently  the projects could be subject to significant cost increases for labor  materials  scope changes and changes in design 
unsuccessful construction  expansion or modernization efforts could be subject to additional costs and or the write off of our investment in the project or improvement 
the construction of new power plants and associated expansion of our transmission system will require a significant amount of capital expenditures 
we cannot provide certainty that adequate external financing will be available to support the construction 
additionally  borrowings incurred to finance construction may adversely impact our leverage  which could increase our cost of capital 
for certain new baseload generating facilities  we may pursue joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties in order to share some of the financing and operational risks  but we cannot be certain we will be able to successfully negotiate any such arrangement 
furthermore  joint ventures or joint ownership arrangements also present risks and uncertainties  including those associated with sharing control over the construction and operation of a facility and reliance on the other party s financial or operational strength 
our assumptions regarding future growth and resulting power demand in our service territories may not be realized 
like other parts of the united states  our service territories and business have been negatively impacted by the current economic conditions 
the timing and extent of the recovery of the economy cannot be predicted 
we may increase our baseload capacity based on anticipated growth levels and have excess capacity if those levels are not realized 
the resulting excess capacity may exceed the reserve margins established by the ncuc  scpsc and fpsc to meet our obligation to serve retail customers and  as a result  may not be recoverable 
nuclear in addition to the risks discussed above  the successful construction of a new nuclear power plant requires the satisfaction of a number of conditions 
the conditions include  but are not limited to  the continued operation of the industry s existing nuclear fleet in a safe  reliable and cost effective manner  an efficient and successful licensing process and a viable program for managing spent nuclear fuel 
we cannot provide certainty that these conditions will exist 
while we have not made a final determination on nuclear construction  we have taken steps to keep open the option of building a plant or plants 
we will continue to evaluate the ongoing viability of our nuclear construction projects based on certain criteria  including obtaining the col  public  regulatory and political support  adequate financial cost recovery mechanisms  and availability and terms of capital financing 
adverse changes in these criteria could result in project cost increases or project termination 
pef has entered into an epc agreement for levy 
however  because of schedule shifts  we executed an amendment to the epc agreement and will postpone major construction activities on the project until after the nrc issues the col 
because we have executed an amendment to the epc agreement and anticipate negotiating additional amendments upon receipt of the col  we cannot currently predict the timing of when those obligations will be satisfied or the magnitude of any change 
in light of the schedule shifts  pef may incur disposition fees and charges related to the disposition of outstanding purchase orders on long lead time equipment for the levy nuclear project  which could be material 
in june  pef completed its long lead time equipment disposition analysis to minimize the impact associated with the schedule shift 
pef is in suspension negotiations with the equipment vendors regarding those long lead time equipment items for which work was suspended 
the amount of disposition fees and charges  if any  cannot be determined until suspension negotiations are completed 
in addition  other col applicants would be pursuing regulatory approval  permitting and construction at roughly the same time as we would 
consequently  there may be shortages of qualified individuals to design  construct and operate these proposed new nuclear facilities 
gas in addition to the risks discussed above  the successful construction of a gas fired plant requires access to an adequate supply of natural gas 
the gas pipeline infrastructure in eastern and western north carolina is limited 
existing pipelines will have to be extended to the new plant locations prior to commencement of operations  which introduces the risks associated with a critical construction project not under our direct control 
power plants fueled by fossil fuels such as natural gas and fuel oil emit ghg  which may be subject to future regulation 
coal in addition to the risks discussed above  the successful modernization of a coal fired power plant requires the satisfaction of a number of conditions  including  but not limited to  consideration of emissions that impact air and water quality and management of coal combustion products such as slag  bottom ash and fly ash 
we are subject to renewable energy standards that may have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to state renewable energy standards in north carolina 
north carolina s standards include use of energy from specified renewable energy resources or implementation of energy efficiency measures totaling percent by florida energy law enacted in includes provisions for development of a renewable portfolio standard but the rulemaking process is not complete 
we may be subject to additional state or federal level standards in the future that could require the utilities to produce or buy a higher portion of their energy from renewable energy sources 
mandated state and federal standards could result in the use of renewable energy sources that are not cost effective in order to comply with requirements 
if we are not able to receive retail rates reflecting our costs or investments to comply with the state or federal standards  our financial condition and results of operation may be adversely affected 
there are inherent potential risks in the operation of nuclear facilities  including environmental  health  safety  regulatory  terrorism  and financial risks  that could result in fines or the shutdown of our nuclear units  which may present potential financial exposures in excess of our insurance coverage 
pec operates four nuclear units three of which are jointly owned and pef jointly owns and operates one nuclear unit 
in addition  we are exploring the possibility of expanding our nuclear generating capacity to meet future expected baseload generation needs 
our nuclear facilities are subject to operational  environmental  health and financial risks such as the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel  maintaining adequate capital reserves for decommissioning  limitations on amounts and types of insurance available  potential operational liabilities and extended outages  and the costs of securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks 
we maintain decommissioning trusts and external insurance coverage to minimize the financial exposure to these risks 
however  damages from an accident or business interruption at our nuclear units could exceed the amount of our insurance coverage 
for pef  it may incur liabilities to co owners in the event of extended outages or operation at less than full capacity 
if the utilities are not allowed to recover the additional costs incurred either through insurance or regulatory mechanisms  our results of operations could be negatively impacted 
the nrc has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety related requirements for the operation of nuclear generating facilities 
in the event of noncompliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines  set license conditions  shut down a nuclear unit  or take some combination of these actions  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
revised safety requirements promulgated by the nrc could require us to make substantial expenditures at our nuclear plants 
in addition  although we have no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at our plants  if an incident did occur  it could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
a major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the nrc to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit 
our nuclear facilities have operating licenses that need to be renewed periodically 
we anticipate successful renewal of these licenses 
however  potential terrorist threats and increased public scrutiny of utilities could result in an extended process with higher licensing or compliance costs 
with construction beginning on a number of new nuclear facilities around the world  and the prospect of several projects across the united states  there will be increased competition within the energy sector for skilled technical workers for both the construction and operation of nuclear facilities 
our ability to successfully operate our nuclear facilities is dependent upon our continued ability to recruit and retain skilled technical workers 
we are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations that require significant capital expenditures  increase our cost of operations  and may impact or limit our business plans  or expose us to environmental liabilities 
we are subject to numerous environmental regulations affecting many aspects of our present and future operations  including air emissions  water quality  wastewater discharges  solid waste  and hazardous waste production  handling and disposal 
these laws and regulations can result in increased capital  operating and other costs  particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on existing power plants and compliance plans with regard to new and existing power plants 
these laws and regulations generally require us to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses  permits  authorizations and other approvals 
both public officials and private individuals may seek to enforce applicable environmental laws and regulations 
failure to comply with applicable regulations and permits might result in the imposition of fines and penalties by regulatory authorities 
we cannot provide assurance that existing environmental regulations will not be revised or that new environmental regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us 
increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions from revised or additional regulation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our ratepayers 
in addition  we may be deemed a responsible party for environmental clean up at sites identified by a regulatory body or private party 
we cannot predict with certainty the amount or timing of future expenditures related to environmental matters because of the difficulty of estimating clean up costs 
there is also uncertainty in quantifying liabilities under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all prps 
while we accrue for probable costs that can be reasonably estimated  not all costs can be reasonably estimated or accrued and actual costs may materially exceed our accruals 
material costs in excess of our accruals could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
our coal fired plants produce coal combustion products  primarily ash 
the epa and a number of states are considering additional regulatory measures that may affect management  treatment  marketing and disposal of coal combustion residues 
revised or new laws or regulations under consideration may impose changes in solid waste classifications or additional environmental controls for groundwater protection  and future mitigation of related impacts could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
we are also evaluating the effect on groundwater quality from past and current operations  which may result in operational changes and additional measures 
our compliance with evolving environmental regulations  including those regarding water quality and the reduction of emissions of nox  so and mercury from coal fired power plants  is anticipated to require significant capital expenditures that could impact our financial condition 
these costs are anticipated to be eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses 
the operation of emission control equipment needed to comply with requirements set by various environmental regulations increases our operating costs and reduces the generating capacity of our coal fired plants 
o m expenses significantly increase due to the additional personnel  materials and general maintenance associated with operation of the equipment 
operation of the emission control equipment requires the procurement of significant quantities of reagents  such as limestone and ammonia 
future increases in demand for these items from other utility companies operating similar equipment could increase our costs associated with operating the equipment 
additionally  the operation of emission control equipment may result in the development of collateral issues that require further remedial actions  resulting in additional expenditures and operating costs 
we are subject to risks associated with climate change  which could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
future legislation or regulations related to climate change may impose significant restrictions on co and other ghg emissions 
we may incur significant costs to comply with such legislation or regulations or in connection with related litigation 
physical risks associated with climate change could impact us 
growing state  federal and international attention to global climate change may result in the regulation of co and other ghgs 
any future legislative or regulatory actions taken to address global climate change represent a business risk to our operations and the full impact of such initiatives on our operations cannot be determined at this time  however  we anticipate that it could result in significant cost increases over time  for which the utilities would seek corresponding rate recovery 
reductions in co emissions to the levels specified by some proposals could be materially adverse to our financial position or results of operations if associated costs of control or limitation cannot be recovered from ratepayers 
according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change  potential climate change impacts in the southeastern united states could include warmer days and nights  increased total rainfall from heavy storms  increased severe weather events  sea level rise and increased drought conditions 
an increase in the number of heat waves  periods of drought and sea level rise could result in changes in energy demand due to shifting populations and industry 
as noted below  severe weather may adversely affect our results of operations 
we could become subject to litigation related to the purported impacts of ghg emissions 
a number of legal actions have been filed against other electric utilities asserting public and private nuisance  trespass and negligence claims 
because weather conditions directly influence the demand for  our ability to provide  and the cost of providing electricity  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows can fluctuate on a seasonal or quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather 
weather conditions in our service territories directly influence the demand for electricity and affect the price of energy commodities necessary to provide electricity to our customers 
as a result  our future overall operating results may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis 
in addition  we have historically sold less power  and consequently earned less income  when weather conditions were mild 
unusually mild weather could diminish our results of operations and harm our financial condition 
sustained severe drought conditions could impact generation by pec s hydroelectric plants  as well as our fossil and nuclear plant operations  as these facilities use water for cooling purposes and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment 
furthermore  destruction caused by severe weather events  such as hurricanes  tornadoes  severe thunderstorms  snow and ice storms  can result in lost operating revenues due to outages  property damage  including downed transmission and distribution lines  and additional and unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage 
our ability to recover significant costs resulting from severe weather events is subject to regulatory oversight  and the timing and amount of any such recovery is uncertain and may impact our financial conditions 
we are subject to incurring significant costs resulting from damage sustained during severe weather events 
while the utilities have historically been granted regulatory approval to defer and amortize or collect from customers the majority of significant storm costs incurred  the utilities storm cost recovery petitions may not always be granted or may not be granted in a timely manner 
if we cannot recover costs associated with future severe weather events in a timely manner  or in an amount sufficient to cover our actual costs  our financial conditions and results of operations could be materially and adversely impacted 
under its base rate settlement agreement  pef is allowed to recover the costs of named storms on an expedited basis through a surcharge on monthly residential customer bills for storm costs 
in the event the storm costs exceed the maximum allowed surcharge  excess additional costs can be deferred and recovered in a subsequent year or years as determined by the fpsc 
additionally  the order approving the settlement agreement allows pef to use the surcharge to replenish the storm damage reserve to a specified level after storm costs are fully recovered 
pec does not maintain a storm damage reserve account and does not have a cost recovery clause to recover storm costs 
pec may request recovery of significant storm related costs  pec has previously sought and received permission from the ncuc and the scpsc to defer storm expenses and amortize them over agreed upon time periods 
our revenues  operating results and financial condition are impacted by customer growth and usage in our service territories and may fluctuate with current economic conditions 
we are also impacted by the demand and competitive state of the wholesale market 
our revenues  operating results and financial condition are impacted by customer growth and usage 
customer growth can be impacted by population growth as well as by economic factors  including but not limited to  job growth and housing market trends 
the utilities are impacted by the economic cycles of the customers we serve 
as our service territories experience economic downturns  residential customer consumption patterns may change and our revenues may be negatively impacted 
if our commercial and industrial customers experience economic downturns  their consumption of electricity may decline and our revenues can be negatively impacted 
like other parts of the united states  our service territories and business have been impacted by the current economic conditions 
the timing and extent of the recovery of the economy cannot be predicted 
additionally  our customers could voluntarily reduce their consumption of electricity in response to decreases in their disposable income or individual energy conservation efforts 
wholesale revenues fluctuate with regional demand  fuel prices and contracted capacity 
our wholesale profitability is dependent upon market conditions and our ability to renew or replace expiring wholesale contracts on favorable terms 
based on economic conditions in effect when wholesale contracts expire  the utilities may not be successful in renewing or replacing expiring contracts 
fluctuations in commodity prices or availability may adversely affect various aspects of the utilities operations as well as the utilities financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  coal  fuel oil  nuclear fuel  electricity and other energy related commodities  including emission allowances  as a result of our ownership of energy related assets 
fuel costs are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses  subject to the utilities state utility commissions approval 
additionally  we have hedging strategies in place to mitigate fluctuations in commodity supply prices  but to the extent that we do not cover our entire exposure to commodity price fluctuations  or our hedging procedures do not work as planned  there can be no assurances that our financial performance will not be negatively impacted by price fluctuations 
additionally  we are exposed to risk that our counterparties will not be able to perform their obligations 
should our counterparties fail to perform  we might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market prices 
in such event  we might incur losses in addition to the amounts  if any  already paid to the counterparties 
certain of our hedge agreements may result in the receipt of  or posting of  derivative collateral with our counterparties  depending on the daily derivative position 
fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to our return of collateral received and or our posting of collateral with our counterparties negatively impact our liquidity 
downgrades in our credit ratings could lead to additional collateral posting requirements 
we continually monitor our derivative positions in relation to market price activity 
volatility in market prices for fuel and power may result from  among other items weather conditions  seasonality  power usage  illiquid markets  transmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies  technological changes  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources  demand for energy commodities  natural gas  crude oil and refined products  nuclear fuel and coal production levels  natural disasters  wars  terrorism  embargoes and other catastrophic events  and federal  state and foreign energy and environmental regulation and legislation 
in addition  we anticipate significant capital expenditures for environmental compliance and baseload generation 
the completion of these projects within established budgets is contingent upon many variables including the securing of labor and materials at estimated costs 
the demand and prices for labor and materials are subject to volatility and may increase in the future 
we are subject to the risk that cost overages may not be recoverable from ratepayers and our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows may be adversely impacted 
prices for emission allowance credits fluctuate 
while allowances are eligible for annual recovery in pef s jurisdictions in florida and pec s in south carolina  no such annual recovery exists in north carolina for pec 
future changes in the price of allowances could have a significant adverse financial impact on us and pec and  consequently  on our results of operations and cash flows 
as a holding company with no revenue generating operations  the parent is dependent on upstream cash flows from its subsidiaries  primarily the utilities  its commercial paper and credit facilities  and its ability to access the long term debt and equity capital markets 
the parent is a holding company and  as such  has no revenue generating operations of its own 
the primary cash needs at the parent level are our common stock dividend  interest and principal payments on the parent s senior unsecured debt and potentially funding a portion of the utilities capital expenditures through equity contributions 
the parent s ability to meet these needs is typically funded with dividends from the utilities generated from their earnings and cash flows  and to a lesser extent  dividends from other subsidiaries  repayment of funds due to the parent by its subsidiaries  the parent s credit facility  and or the parent s ability to access the short term and long term debt and equity capital markets 
prior to funding the parent  its subsidiaries have financial obligations that must be satisfied  including  among others  their respective debt service  preferred dividends and obligations to trade creditors 
additionally  the utilities could retain their free cash flow to fund their capital expenditures in lieu of receiving equity contributions from the parent 
should the utilities not be able to pay dividends or repay funds due to the parent or if the parent cannot access the commercial paper market  its credit facilities or the long term debt and equity capital markets  the parent s ability to pay principal  interest and dividends would be restricted 
the parent could change its existing common stock dividend policy based upon these and other business factors our business is dependent on our ability to successfully access capital markets on favorable terms 
limits on our access to capital may adversely impact our ability to execute our business plan or pursue improvements that we would otherwise rely on for future growth 
our cash requirements are driven by the capital intensive nature of our utilities 
in addition to operating cash flows  we rely heavily on commercial paper  long term debt and equity issuances 
if access to these sources of liquidity becomes constrained  our ability to implement our business strategy will be adversely affected 
market disruptions or a downgrade of our credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing and may adversely affect our ability to access the financial markets 
if we cannot fund our expected capital expenditures and debt maturities through normal operations or by accessing capital markets  our business plans  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows may be adversely impacted 
we typically issue commercial paper to meet short term liquidity needs 
when financial and economic conditions result in tightened short term credit markets  coupled with corresponding volatility in commercial paper durations and interest rates  we evaluate other options for meeting our short term liquidity needs  which may include borrowing from our revolving credit agreements rcas  issuing short term notes  issuing long term debt and or issuing equity 
in addition  if our short term credit ratings are downgraded below tier a p f we could experience increased volatility in commercial paper durations and interest rates and our access to the commercial paper markets may be negatively impacted 
in that case  we would evaluate other options for meeting our short term liquidity needs as previously described 
these alternative sources of liquidity may not be available or may not have comparable favorable terms and  thus  may impact adversely our business plans  financial condition  and results of operations or cash flows 
increases in our leverage or reductions in our cash flow could adversely affect our competitive position  business planning and flexibility  financial condition  ability to service our debt obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock  and ability to access capital on favorable terms 
as discussed above  we typically rely heavily on our commercial paper and long term debt 
our credit agreements contain certain provisions and impose various limitations that could impact our liquidity  such as cross default provisions and defined maximum total debt to total capital leverage ratios 
under these revolving credit facilities  indebtedness includes certain letters of credit and guarantees that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets 
as previously discussed  we are anticipating extensive capital needs for new generation  transmission and distribution facilities  and environmental compliance expenditures 
funding these capital needs could increase our leverage and present numerous risks including those addressed below 
in the event our leverage increases such that we approach the permitted ratios  our access to capital and additional liquidity could decrease 
a limitation in our liquidity could have a material adverse impact on our business strategy and our ongoing financing needs 
additionally  a significant increase in our leverage or reductions in cash flow could adversely affect us by increasing the cost of future debt financing  impacting our ability to pay dividends on our common stock at the current rate  making it more difficult for us to satisfy our existing financial obligations  increasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to debt repayment  thereby reducing funds available for operations  future business opportunities or other purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we compete  requiring the issuance of additional equity  placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors who have less debt  and causing a downgrade in our credit ratings 
any reduction in our credit ratings below investment grade would likely increase our financing costs  limit our access to additional capital and require posting of collateral  all of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
while the long term target credit ratings for the parent and the utilities are above the minimum investment grade rating  we cannot provide certainty that any of our current ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances in the future so warrant 
such circumstances could include  among others  increases in leverage  adverse changes in other financial metrics  and adverse regulatory outcomes 
our debt indentures and credit agreements do not contain any ratings triggers  which would cause the acceleration of interest and principal payments in the event of a ratings downgrade 
any downgrade could increase our borrowing costs  may adversely affect our access to capital and could result in the posting of additional collateral for derivatives in a liability position  which could negatively impact our financial results and business plans 
any reduction in our credit ratings below investment grade could also result in collateral posting requirements for certain of our natural gas transportation contracts 
we note that the ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold our securities or those of pec or pef and that each agency s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency s rating 
market performance and other changes may decrease the value of nuclear decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets  which then could require significant additional funding 
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy future obligations to decommission the utilities nuclear plants and under our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
we have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts 
these assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns  which may fall below our projected rates of return 
although a number of factors impact our funding requirements  a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for decommissioning the utilities nuclear plants and under our defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
additionally  changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans  as interest rates decrease  the liabilities increase  potentially requiring additional funding 
further  the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefit plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics  including increased numbers of retirements or changes in life expectancy assumptions 
if we are unable to successfully manage the nuclear decommissioning trust funds and benefit plan assets  our results of operation and financial position could be negatively affected 
impairment of goodwill could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 
all of our goodwill is allocated to our utility reporting units  and goodwill impairment tests are performed at the utility reporting unit level 
we calculate the fair value of our utility reporting units by considering various factors  including valuation studies based primarily on income and market approaches 
the calculations in both approaches are highly dependent on subjective factors such as management s estimate of future cash flows  the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates from a marketplace participant s perspective  and the selection of peer utilities and marketplace transactions for comparative valuation purposes 
the estimated future cash flows are based on the utilities business plans that assume the occurrence of certain events in the future  such as the outcome of future rate filings  future approved rates of returns on equity  the timing of anticipated significant future capital investments  the anticipated earnings and returns related to such capital investments  continued recovery of cost of service and renewal of certain contracts 
these underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time 
if these assumptions change or should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions  the fair value of the utility reporting units could be significantly different in future periods  which could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill 
impairment of our recorded goodwill could result in volatility in our earnings under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and an increase in our leverage  which could trigger a downgrade of our credit ratings leading to higher borrowing costs and or dilution through additional issuances of common stock 
however  in the event of a goodwill impairment  we do not expect any such impairment to cause us to violate any financial or restrictive covenants contained in our indebtedness or other contractual arrangements 
our ability to fully utilize tax credits generated under section k may be limited 
this risk is not applicable to pec and pef 
in accordance with the provisions of section k  we have generated tax credits based on the content and quantity of coal based solid synthetic fuels produced and sold to unrelated parties 
this tax credit program expired at the end of the timing of the utilization of the tax credits is dependent upon our taxable income  which can be impacted by a number of factors 
the timing of the utilization can also be impacted by certain substantial changes in ownership  including the merger 
additionally  in the normal course of business  our tax returns are audited by the irs 
if our tax credits were disallowed in whole or in part as a result of an irs audit  there could be significant additional tax liabilities and associated interest for previously recognized tax credits  which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows 
although we are unaware of any currently proposed legislation or new irs regulations or interpretations impacting previously recorded synthetic fuels tax credits  the value of credits generated could be unfavorably impacted by such legislation or irs regulations and interpretations

accordingly  the information presented in this form k is presented solely for the progress registrants on a pre merger basis 
strategy we are an integrated energy company primarily focused on the end use electricity markets 
we own two electric utilities that operate in regulated retail utility markets in north carolina  south carolina and florida and have access to attractive wholesale markets in the eastern united states 
the utilities have more than  megawatts mw of regulated electric generation capacity and serve approximately million retail electric customers as well as other load serving entities 
we have a strong track record of meeting our financial commitments 
we have maintained liquidity and financial stability and sustained our dividend rate during the current economic downturn  and we believe that we have good prospects for growth once the economy begins to recover 
in terms of our priorities for progress energy as a whole  we first focus on excelling in the fundamentals of our business 
these fundamentals include safety  operational excellence  customer service  consistently achieving our financial objectives  maintaining constructive relations with regulators  political leaders and the general public as well as an internal focus on strong leadership that fully engages our workforce for high performance 
in addition to excelling in these fundamentals  management has the following four focus areas for improve the performance of our nuclear fleet accelerate continuous business excellence optimize our balanced solution strategy achieve effective integration planning and timely merger approvals improve nuclear fleet performance we are implementing a comprehensive improvement plan designed to strengthen and align the performance of our nuclear fleet 
we are committed to raising our nuclear fleet performance to a consistently high level of safety  reliability and value 
to do that  we have made a number of organizational changes and have intensified our focus on plant operations  outage planning and execution  and continuous improvement 
we are also leveraging the expertise and capabilities of our company as a whole to meet these nuclear fleet objectives 
continuous business excellence for the past several years  we have been applying a continuous improvement framework to our operations through our continuous business excellence initiative 
through a disciplined approach to identifying and eliminating waste and continuously improving our business  we are developing sustainable process improvements 
we are gaining a clearer understanding of our cost drivers and of the dynamics shaping our near and longer term workforce planning needs 
in addition  we have been applying the lean process to our operations lean is a set of principles  tools  and techniques for improving the operating performance of any business 
during  we held more than lean events  a percent increase over the prior year 
the process changes resulting from these events are improving our safety and operational performance  enhancing the productivity and engagement of our employees  managing our rising costs and  ultimately  increasing customer satisfaction 
balanced solution strategy our balanced solution strategy is a portfolio of investments and initiatives to meet future customer needs and evolving public policies in a way that creates long term value for our customers and shareholders 
the strategy is focused on expanding the diversity of our resources  including energy efficiency  alternative energy and a state of the art power system 
expenditures to achieve our balanced solution are anticipated to be recoverable under base rates or cost recovery mechanisms implemented by our state jurisdictions 
updates on our implementation of this strategy are discussed below 
first  we are continuing to expand and enhance our demand side management dsm  energy efficiency ee and energy conservation programs 
we have implemented customer energy saving programs  provided customers with incentives for efficiency improvements and expanded our customer education and outreach efforts 
in addition  we are a leader in the utility industry in promoting and preparing for plug in electric vehicles 
we are participating  along with nine other utilities across the nation  in chevrolet s two year demonstration and research program for its volt electric vehicle 
as a program participant  we will use electric vehicles to conduct a variety of utility service roles 
additionally  we will gather data from driver surveys and charging stations and study the impact of the vehicles on the electric grid 
second  we are actively engaged in a variety of alternative energy projects 
we have executed contracts to purchase mw of electricity generated from solar  biomass and municipal solid waste sources 
while this currently represents a small percentage of our total capacity  we will continue to pursue additional contracts for these and other alternative energy sources 
pec is on track to meet the first of the targets set under north carolina s renewable energy portfolio standard  percent of retail electric sales by third  we are pursuing numerous options to create a state of the art power system 
we are making a significant investment in smart grid technology with the initiatives partially funded by million of federal matching infrastructure funds 
our strategy also includes advanced environmental controls on our coal fired plants  and we have successfully completed the billion of emission control installations planned for our coal fleets in north carolina and florida 
of our approximately  mw of coal fired generation  we have scrubbed and installed emission control equipment on almost  mw 
we are also moving forward with our previously announced coal to gas modernization strategy  which includes retiring our north carolina coal fired plants that do not have scrubbers totaling approximately  mw and replacing them with new combined cycle natural gas plants 
we expect to retire these coal fired generating facilities no later than the end of  and the new natural gas plants are expected to be placed in service in and as a result of the installation of environmental controls and the retirement of unscrubbed coal fired plants  our emissions profile will be significantly reduced while strengthening our fuel diversification 
a reduced emissions profile puts us in a better position to comply with the more stringent environmental regulations anticipated in the future 
new nuclear generation is a vital long term part of our balanced solution strategy 
while we have not made a final determination on nuclear construction  we have taken steps to keep open the option of building one or more plants 
the utilities have each filed a combined license col application with the nrc for two additional reactors each at shearon harris nuclear plant harris and at a greenfield site in levy county  florida levy 
we have focused on levy given the need for more fuel diversity in florida and anticipated federal and state policies to reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions  as well as existing state legislative policy that is supportive of nuclear projects 
pef has entered into an engineering  procurement and construction epc agreement and received two of the three key approvals needed for the proposed levy units with the issuance of the col remaining 
in light of a regulatory schedule shift and other factors  we have amended the epc agreement and are deferring major construction on levy until we receive the col  expected in this decision will reduce the near term price impact on customers and allows time for economic recovery and greater clarity on federal and state policies 
once we have received the col  we will assess the project and determine the schedule 
integration planning and timely merger approvals we are in the early stages of integration planning for the merger  and are also preparing for the various steps in the merger approval process 
we believe our continuous business excellence initiative will help us in the merger integration process 
one important element of the initiative is getting a better understanding of the dynamics shaping near and long term workforce needs  which will be beneficial in integration planning 
integration planning efforts will also focus on savings from the fuel purchasing power and joint dispatch of generating plants of the combined companies 
maintaining constructive relations with regulators  public leaders and the general public is fundamental to our business  which will be critical for obtaining needed merger approvals in a timely manner 
matters impacting future results and liquidity the impact of favorable weather on the utilities revenues in offset the impacts of a continuing sluggish economy and cost pressures facing the utility industry 
an improving national economy may lead to greater mobility for homeowners around the country and a return of migration to the southeast region that is more consistent with our historical levels 
however  the utility industry  as a whole  faces significant cost pressures and  in the near term  lower retail electricity sales 
current economic conditions and anticipated higher expenditures including expenditures for environmental compliance  renewable energy standards compliance and new generation and transmission facilities may subject us to an even higher level of scrutiny from regulators and lead to a more uncertain regulatory environment 
timely regulatory recovery of costs recoverable under the utilities pass through clauses such as fuel and environmental compliance is important to maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity 
we are preparing for an energy future that includes  among other things  carbon reductions and emerging technologies such as smart grid and plug in electric vehicles 
we believe that our balanced solution strategy provides an effective  flexible framework that will prepare us for this new energy future 
results of operations in this section  we provide analysis and discussion of earnings and the factors affecting earnings on both a gaap and non gaap basis 
we introduce our results of operations in an overview section followed by a more detailed analysis and discussion by business segment 
we compute our non gaap financial measurement ongoing earnings as gaap net income attributable to controlling interests after excluding discontinued operations and the effects of certain identified gains and charges  which are considered ongoing earnings adjustments 
some of the excluded gains and charges have occurred in more than one reporting period but are not considered representative of fundamental core earnings 
ongoing earnings is not a measure calculated in accordance with gaap  and should be viewed as a supplement to  and not a substitute for  our results of operations presented in accordance with gaap 
a reconciliation of ongoing earnings to gaap net income attributable to controlling interests follows in millions except per share data pec pef corporate and other total per share year ended december  ongoing earnings impairment  net of tax a plant retirement charge  net of tax a change in the tax treatment of the medicare part d subsidy discontinued operations attributable to controlling interests  net of tax net income loss attributable to controlling interests b year ended december  ongoing earnings cvo mark to market impairment  net of tax a plant retirement charge  net of tax a cumulative prior period adjustment related to certain employee life insurance benefits  net of tax a discontinued operations attributable to controlling interests  net of tax net income loss attributable to controlling interests b year ended december  ongoing earnings valuation allowance and related net operating loss carry forward discontinued operations attributable to controlling interests  net of tax net income loss attributable to controlling interests b a calculated using assumed tax rate of percent 
b net income attributable to controlling interests is shown net of preferred stock dividend requirement of million and million at pec and pef  respectively 
management uses the non gaap financial measure ongoing earnings i as a measure of operating performance to assist in comparing performance from period to period on a consistent basis and to readily view operating trends  ii as a measure for planning and forecasting overall expectations and for evaluating actual results against such expectations  iii as a measure for determining levels of incentive compensation  and iv in communications with our board of directors  employees  shareholders  analysts and investors concerning our financial performance 
management believes this non gaap measure is appropriate for understanding the business and assessing our potential future performance  because excluded items are limited to those that management believes are not representative of our fundamental core earnings see note 
overview for as compared to and as compared to for the year ended december   our net income attributable to controlling interests was million  or per share  compared to net income attributable to controlling interests of million  or per share  for the same period in the increase as compared to prior year was primarily due to favorable weather at the utilities and lower loss from discontinued non utility businesses ongoing earnings adjustment

in  we recognized million of income from discontinued operations attributable to controlling interests  net of tax  which was comprised primarily of million after tax gains on sales of our coal terminals and docks in west virginia and kentucky and our remaining coal mining businesses 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
in doing so  we made certain estimates that were critical in nature to the results of operations 
the following discusses those significant accounting policies and estimates that may have a material impact on our financial results and are subject to the greatest amount of subjectivity 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit and corporate performance committee audit committee of our board of directors 
impact of utility regulation our regulated utilities segments are subject to regulation that sets the prices rates we are permitted to charge customers based on the costs that regulatory agencies determine we are permitted to recover 
at times  regulators permit the future recovery through rates of costs that would be currently charged to expense by a nonregulated company 
the application of gaap for regulated operations to this ratemaking process results in deferral of expense recognition and the recording of regulatory assets based on anticipated future cash inflows 
as a result of the different ratemaking processes in each state in which we operate  a significant amount of regulatory assets has been recorded 
we continually review these regulatory assets to assess their ultimate recoverability within the approved regulatory guidelines 
impairment risk associated with these assets relates to potentially adverse legislative  judicial or regulatory actions in the future 
additionally  the state regulatory agencies ratemaking processes often provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of the regulatory assets 
our conclusion that we and the utilities meet the criteria to apply gaap for regulated operations is a material assumption in the presentation and evaluation of our and the utilities financial position and results of operations 
the utilities ability to continue to meet the criteria for application of gaap for regulated operations could be affected in the future by actions of our regulators  competitive forces and restructuring in the electric utility industry 
state regulators may not allow the utilities to increase future retail rates required to recover their operating costs or provide an adequate return on investment  or in the manner requested 
state regulators may also seek to reduce or freeze retail rates 
such events occurring over a sustained period could result in the utilities no longer meeting the criteria for the continued application of gaap for regulated operations 
in the event that gaap for regulated operations no longer applies to one or both of the utilities  we are subject to the risk that regulatory assets and liabilities would be eliminated and utility plant assets may be impaired  unless an appropriate recovery mechanism was provided 
additionally  our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations may be adversely impacted 
see note for additional information related to the impact of utility regulation on our operations 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives for impairment whenever impairment indicators exist 
if an impairment indicator exists  the asset group held and used is tested for recoverability by comparing the carrying value to the sum of undiscounted expected future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group 
if the asset group is not recoverable through undiscounted cash flows or if the asset group is to be disposed of  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the asset group 
our exposure to potential impairment losses for utility plant  net is mitigated by the fact that our regulated ratemaking process generally allows for recovery of our investment in utility plant plus an allowed return on the investment  as long as the costs are prudently incurred 
the carrying values of our total utility plant  net at december were as follows in millions progress energy pec pef as discussed in note  our financial assets and liabilities are primarily comprised of derivative financial instruments and marketable debt and equity securities held in our nuclear decommissioning trusts 
substantially all unrealized gains and losses on derivatives and all unrealized gains and losses on nuclear decommissioning trust investments are deferred as regulatory liabilities or assets consistent with ratemaking treatment 
therefore  the impact of fair value measurements from recurring financial assets and liabilities on our or the utilities earnings is not significant 
asset retirement obligations asset retirement obligations aros represent legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain tangible long lived assets 
the present values of retirement costs for which we have a legal obligation are recorded as liabilities with an equivalent amount added to the asset cost and depreciated over the useful life of the associated asset 
the liability is then accreted over time by applying an interest method of allocation to the liability 
aros have no impact on the income of the utilities as the effects are offset by the establishment of regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities in order to reflect the ratemaking treatment of the related costs 
progress energy s  pec s and pef s total aros at december   were billion  million  and million  respectively 
we calculated the present value of our aros based on estimates which are dependent on subjective factors such as management s estimated retirement costs  the timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount and cost escalation rates 
these underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time and are subject to change 
these changes could materially affect the aros  although changes in such estimates should not affect earnings  because these costs are expected to be recovered through rates 
nuclear decommissioning aros represent percent  percent  and percent  respectively  of progress energy s  pec s and pef s total aros at december  to determine nuclear decommissioning aros  we utilize periodic site specific cost studies in order to estimate the nature  cost and timing of planned decommissioning activities for our nuclear plants 
our regulators require updated cost estimates for nuclear decommissioning every five years 
these cost studies are subject to change based on a variety of factors including  but not limited to  cost escalation  changes in technology applicable to nuclear decommissioning and changes in federal  state or local regulations 
changes in pec s and pef s nuclear decommissioning site specific cost estimates or the use of alternative cost escalation or discount rates could be material to the nuclear decommissioning liabilities recognized 
pec obtained updated cost studies for its nuclear plants in  using cost factors  which pec filed with the ncuc in if the site specific cost estimates increased by percent  pec s aros would have increased by million 
if the inflation adjustment increased basis points  pec s aros would have increased by million 
similarly  an increase in the discount rate of basis points would have decreased pec s aros by million 
pef obtained an updated cost study for its nuclear plant in  using cost factors  which pef filed with the fpsc in as part of pef s base rate filing 
as discussed in note c  the fpsc deferred review of pef s nuclear decommissioning study from the rate case to be addressed in in order for fpsc staff to assess pef s study in combination with other utilities anticipated to submit nuclear decommissioning studies in pef was not required to prepare a new site specific nuclear decommissioning study in  however  pef was required to update the study with the most currently available escalation rates in  which was filed with the fpsc in december if the site specific cost estimates increased by percent  pef s aros would have increased by million 
if the inflation adjustment increased basis points  pef s aros would have increased by million 
similarly  an increase in the discount rate of basis points would have decreased pef s aros by million 
goodwill as discussed in note  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually and more frequently when indicators of impairment exist 
all of our goodwill is allocated to our utility reporting units and our goodwill impairment tests are performed at the utility reporting unit level 
the carrying amounts of goodwill at december  and  for the pec and pef reporting units were billion and billion  respectively 
as discussed in note d  in october we prospectively changed our annual goodwill testing date from april to october to better align our impairment testing procedures with the completion of our annual financial and strategic planning process 
as a result  during  we tested our goodwill for impairment as of october  and april   and concluded there was no impairment of the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the estimated fair values of pec and pef on those dates had been lower by percent  there still would be no impact on the reported value of their goodwill 
in addition  based on the results of impairment tests performed in april and april  we concluded there was no impairment of the carrying value of the goodwill in the prior periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
this change in accounting principle did not accelerate  delay  avoid  or cause a goodwill impairment charge 
we calculate the fair value of our utility reporting units by considering various factors  including valuation studies based primarily on income and market approaches 
more emphasis is applied to the income approach as substantially all of the utilities cash flows are from rate regulated operations 
in such environments  revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs  sales volumes and costs of capital 
accordingly  the utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects  positive or negative  of significant swings in market or economic conditions 
the income approach uses discounted cash flow analyses to determine the fair value of the utility reporting units 
the estimated future cash flows from operations are based on the utilities business plans  which reflect management s assumptions related to customer usage based on internal data and economic data obtained from third party sources 
the business plans assume the occurrence of certain events in the future  such as the outcome of future rate filings  future approved rates of returns on equity  the timing of anticipated significant future capital investments  the anticipated earnings and returns related to such capital investments  continued recovery of cost of service and the renewal of certain contracts 
management also determines the appropriate discount rate for the utility reporting units based on the weighted average cost of capital for each utility  which takes into account both the cost of equity and pre tax cost of debt 
as each utility reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations  the discount rate for each reporting unit may differ 
the market approach uses implied market multiples derived from comparable peer utilities and market transactions to estimate the fair value of the utility reporting units 
peer utilities are evaluated based on percentage of revenues generated by regulated utility operations  percentage of revenues generated by electric operations  generation mix  including coal  gas  nuclear and other resources  market capitalization as of the valuation date  and geographic location 
comparable market transactions are evaluated based on the availability of financial transaction data and the nature and geographic location of the businesses or assets acquired  including whether the target company had a significant electric component 
the selection of comparable peer utilities and market transactions  as well as the appropriate multiples from within a reasonable range  is a matter of professional judgment 
the calculations in both the income and market approaches are highly dependent on subjective factors such as management s estimate of future cash flows  the selection of appropriate discount and growth rates from a marketplace participant s perspective  and the selection of peer utilities and marketplace transactions for comparative valuation purposes 
these underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time 
if these assumptions change or should the actual outcome of some or all of these assumptions differ significantly from the current assumptions  the fair value of the utility reporting units could be significantly different in future periods  which could result in a future impairment charge to goodwill 
as an overall test of the reasonableness of the estimated fair values of the utility reporting units  we compared their combined fair value estimate to progress energy s market capitalization as of october  and april  the analyses confirmed that the fair values were reasonably representative of market views when applying a reasonable control premium to the market capitalization 
we monitor for events or circumstances  including financial market conditions and economic factors  that may indicate an interim goodwill impairment test is necessary 
we would perform an interim impairment test should any events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a utility reporting unit below its carrying value 
as a result of the merger agreement discussed within md a introduction merger and in note  we considered whether an interim goodwill impairment test was necessary 
based upon reasonable allocations of the merger consideration to pec and pef  we concluded their fair values exceeded their carrying values  and no interim impairment test was necessary 
unbilled revenue as discussed in note  we recognize electric utility revenues as service is rendered to customers 
operating revenues include unbilled electric utilities base revenues  primarily related to retail base revenues  earned when service has been delivered but not billed by the end of the accounting period 
the determination of electricity sales to individual customers is based on meter readings  which occur on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  electricity delivered to customers since the last meter reading is estimated and a corresponding accrual for the electric utility revenues associated with unbilled sales is recognized 
unbilled retail revenues are estimated by applying a weighted average revenue kwh for all customer classes to the number of estimated kwh delivered but not billed 
the calculation of unbilled revenue is affected by factors that include fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period  seasonality  weather  customer usage patterns  price in effect for each customer class and estimated transmission and distribution line losses 
amounts recorded as receivables on the balance sheets at december related to unbilled revenues were as follows in millions progress energy pec pef income taxes judgment and the use of estimates are required in developing the provision for income taxes and reporting of tax related assets and liabilities 
as discussed in note  deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future effects on income taxes for temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities for financial reporting and tax purposes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the probability of realizing deferred tax assets is based on forecasts of future taxable income and the availability of tax planning strategies that can be implemented  if necessary  to realize deferred tax assets 
we establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all  or a portion of  a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the interpretation of tax laws involves uncertainty 
ultimate resolution of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows  and adjustments to tax related assets and liabilities could be material 
in accordance with gaap  the uncertainty and judgment involved in the determination and filing of income taxes are accounted for by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
a two step process is required recognition of the tax benefit based on a more likely than not threshold  and measurement of the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
pension costs as discussed in note a  we maintain qualified noncontributory defined benefit retirement pension plans 
we also have supplementary defined benefit pension plans that provide benefits to higher level employees 
our reported costs are dependent on numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
for example  such costs are impacted by employee demographics  changes made to plan provisions  actual plan asset returns and key actuarial assumptions  such as expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates used in determining benefit obligations and annual costs 
due to a decrease in the market interest rates for high quality aaa aa debt securities  which are used as the benchmark for setting the discount rate to calculate the present value of future benefit payments  we decreased the discount rate to at december   from at december   which will increase pension costs  all other factors remaining constant 
our discount rates are selected based on a plan by plan study  which matches our projected benefit payments to a high quality corporate yield curve 
consistent with general market conditions  our plan assets performed well in with returns of approximately 
that positive asset performance will result in decreased pension costs in  all other factors remaining constant 
in addition  contributions to pension plan assets in late and in will result in decreased pension costs in due to increased asset balances and resulting expected earnings on those assets  all other factors remaining constant 
evaluations of the effects of these and other factors on our pension costs have not been completed  but we estimate that the total cost recognized for pensions in will be million to million  compared with million recognized in we have pension plan assets with a fair value of approximately billion at december  our expected rate of return on pension plan assets is 
the expected rate of return used in pension cost recognition is a long term rate of return  therefore  we do not adjust that rate of return frequently 
in  we lowered the expected rate of return from the previously used  due primarily to the uncertainties resulting from the severe capital market deterioration in a basis point change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pension costs by approximately million 
for  we have assumed an expected rate of return of  which was reflected in the estimates of total pension costs discussed within this section 
another factor affecting our pension costs  and sensitivity of the costs to plan asset performance  is the method selected to determine the market related value of assets  ie  the asset value to which the expected long term rate of return is applied 
entities may use either fair value or an averaging method that recognizes changes in fair value over a period not to exceed five years  with the method selected applied on a consistent basis from year to year 
we have historically used a five year averaging method 
when we acquired florida progress in  we retained the florida progress historical use of fair value to determine market related value for florida progress pension assets 
changes in plan asset performance are reflected in pension costs sooner under the fair value method than the five year averaging method  and  therefore  pension costs tend to be more volatile using the fair value method 
approximately percent of our pension plan assets are subject to each of the two methods 
since pec and pef participate in our pension plans  the general discussion above applies to pec and pef 
pec and pef have not completed evaluating their pension costs 
pec estimates that the total cost recognized for pensions in will be million to million  compared with million recognized in a basis point change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pec s pension costs by approximately million 
pef estimates that the total cost recognized for pensions in will be million to million  compared with million recognized in a basis point change in the expected rate of return for would have changed pef s pension costs by approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources overview our significant cash requirements arise primarily from the capital intensive nature of the utilities operations  including expenditures for environmental compliance 
we typically rely upon our operating cash flow  substantially all of which is generated by the utilities  commercial paper and credit facilities  and our ability to access the long term debt and equity capital markets for sources of liquidity 
as discussed in future liquidity and capital resources below  synthetic fuels tax credits will provide an additional source of liquidity as those credits are realized 
the majority of our operating costs are related to the utilities 
most of these costs are recovered from ratepayers in accordance with various rate plans 
we are allowed to recover certain fuel  purchased power and other costs incurred by pec and pef through their respective recovery clauses 
the types of costs recovered through clauses vary by jurisdiction 
fuel price volatility and plant performance can lead to over or under recovery of fuel costs  as changes in fuel expense are not immediately reflected in fuel surcharges due to regulatory lag in setting the surcharges 
as a result  fuel price volatility and plant performance can be both a source of and a use of liquidity resources  depending on what phase of the cycle of price volatility we are experiencing and or how our plants are performing 
changes in the utilities fuel and purchased power costs may affect the timing of cash flows  but not materially affect net income 
as a registered holding company  our establishment of intercompany extensions of credit is subject to regulation by the federal energy regulatory commission ferc 
our subsidiaries participate in internal money pools  administered by pesc  to more effectively utilize cash resources and reduce external short term borrowings 
the utility money pool allows the utilities to lend to and borrow from each other 
a non utility money pool allows our nonregulated operations to lend to and borrow from each other 
the parent can lend money to the utility and non utility money pools but cannot borrow funds 
the parent is a holding company with billion of senior unsecured debt following its issuance of million of senior unsecured debt on january  as a holding company  the parent has no revenue generating operations of its own 
the primary cash needs at the parent level are our common stock dividend  interest and principal payments on the parent s senior unsecured debt and potentially funding the utilities capital expenditures through equity contributions 
the parent s ability to meet these needs is typically funded with dividends from the utilities generated from their earnings and cash flows  and to a lesser extent  dividends from other subsidiaries  repayment of funds due to the parent by its subsidiaries  the parent s credit facility  and or the parent s ability to access the short term and long term debt and equity capital markets 
in recent years  rather than paying dividends to the parent  the utilities  in certain cases  have retained their free cash flow to fund their capital expenditures 
during  pec paid dividends of million and pef paid dividends of million to the parent 
pec and pef expect to pay dividends to the parent in there are a number of factors that impact the utilities decision or ability to pay dividends to the parent or to seek equity contributions from the parent  including capital expenditure decisions and the timing of recovery of fuel and other pass through costs 
therefore  we cannot predict the level of dividends or equity contributions between the utilities and the parent from year to year 
the parent could change its existing common stock dividend policy based upon these and other business factors 
cash from operations  commercial paper issuance  borrowings under our credit facilities and or long term debt financings are expected to fund capital expenditures  long term debt maturities and common stock dividends for we do not expect to realize a material amount of proceeds from the sale of equity in see financing activities 
we have financial institutions that support our combined billion revolving credit facilities for the parent  pec and pef  thereby limiting our dependence on any one institution 
the credit facilities serve as back ups to our commercial paper programs 
to the extent amounts are reserved for commercial paper or letters of credit outstanding  they are not available for additional borrowings 
at december   the parent had no outstanding borrowings under its credit facility  no outstanding commercial paper and had issued million of letters of credit  which were supported by the revolving credit facility 
at december   pec and pef had no outstanding borrowings under their respective credit facilities and no outstanding commercial paper 
based on these outstanding amounts at december   there was a combined billion available for additional borrowings 
at december   pec and pef had limited counterparty mark to market exposure for financial commodity hedges primarily gas and oil hedges due to spreading our concentration risk over a number of counterparties 
in the event of default by a counterparty  the exposure in the transaction is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates 
at december   the majority of the utilities open financial commodity hedges were in net mark to market liability positions 
see note a for additional information with regard to our commodity derivatives 
at december   we had limited mark to market exposure to certain financial institutions under pay fixed forward starting swaps to hedge cash flow risk with regard to future financing transactions for the parent  pec and pef 
in the event of default by a counterparty  the exposure in the transaction is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates 
at december   the sums of the parent s  pec s and pef s open pay fixed forward starting swaps were each in a net mark to market liability position 
see note b for additional information with regard to our interest rate derivatives 
on july   the wall street reform and consumer protection act hr was signed into law 
among other things  the law includes provisions related to the swaps and over the counter derivatives markets 
under the law  we expect to be exempt from mandatory clearing and exchange trading requirements for our commodity and interest rate hedges because we are an end user of these products 
capital and margin requirements for these hedges are expected to be determined as more detailed rules and regulations are published during at this time  we do not expect the law to have a material impact on our financial condition 
however  we cannot determine the impact until the final regulations are issued 
our pension and nuclear decommissioning trust funds are managed by a number of financial institutions  and the assets being managed are diversified in order to limit concentration risk in any one institution or business sector 
we believe our internal and external liquidity resources will be sufficient to fund our current business plans 
we will continue to monitor the credit markets to maintain an appropriate level of liquidity 
our ability to access the capital markets on favorable terms may be negatively impacted by credit rating actions 
risk factors associated with the capital markets and credit ratings are discussed below and in item a  risk factors 
the following discussion of our liquidity and capital resources is on a consolidated basis 
historical for as compared to and as compared to cash flows from operations net cash provided by operations is the primary source used to meet operating requirements and a portion of capital expenditures 
the utilities produced substantially all of our consolidated cash from operations for the years ended december   and net cash provided by operating activities for the three years ended december   and  was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million for  when compared to the increase was primarily due to the million favorable impact of weather  partially offset by million higher nuclear plant outage and maintenance costs included in o m  both as previously discussed  million lower cash used for inventory  primarily due to higher coal consumption in as a result of favorable weather that was fulfilled through the usage of inventory from year end  million payment in due to a verdict in a lawsuit against progress energy and a number of our subsidiaries and affiliates previously engaged in coal based solid synthetic fuels operations see note d  million net cash receipts for income taxes in compared to million net cash payments for income taxes in  and million lower cash used for pension and other benefits  primarily due to a reduction of contributions made in these amounts were partially offset by a million under recovery of fuel in compared to a million over recovery of fuel in due to higher fuel costs and lower fuel rates in and million of net payments of cash collateral to counterparties on derivative contracts in compared to million net refunds of cash collateral in net cash provided by operating activities for increased when compared with the billion increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a million over recovery of fuel in compared to a under recovery of fuel in due to higher fuel rates in and million of cash collateral paid to counterparties on derivative contracts in compared to million net refunds of cash collateral in these impacts were partially offset by million of pension and other benefits contributions made in the utilities file annual requests with their respective state commissions seeking rate increases or decreases for fuel cost under or over recovery 
investing activities net cash used by investing activities for the three years ended december   and  was billion  billion and billion  respectively 
net cash used by investing activities decreased by million for  when compared to this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in gross property additions  primarily due to lower spending for environmental compliance and nuclear projects at pef  partially offset by pec s increased capital expenditures at the wayne county  new hanover county and harris generating facilities  and a million increase in cash provided by other investing activities primarily due to the receipt of nuclear electric insurance limited neil insurance proceeds for repairs due to the cr extended outage see future liquidity and capital resources regulatory matters and recovery of costs cr outage 
excluding proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets  net of cash divested of million in and million in  which are presented in other investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows  cash used in investing activities decreased by million 
the decrease in was primarily due to a million decrease in gross property additions at the utilities  primarily due to lower spending for environmental compliance projects and the completion of pef s bartow plant repowering project in  a million decrease in nuclear fuel additions  and a million decrease in net purchases of available for sale securities and other investments 
available for sale securities and other investments include marketable debt securities and investments held in nuclear decommissioning trusts 
during  proceeds from sales of discontinued operations and other assets primarily included proceeds of million from the sale of our coal terminals and docks and our remaining coal mining businesses see notes a and b 
financing activities net cash used provided by financing activities for the three years ended december   and  was million  million and billion  respectively 
see note for details of debt and credit facilities 
net cash used by financing activities increased by billion for when compared to the increase was primarily due to the billion reduction in proceeds from long term debt issuances  net primarily due to the parent s combined billion issuances and pec s million issuance in compared to pef s million issuance of long term debt in  partially offset by the parent s payments of million on short term debt with original maturities greater than days in net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million for when compared to the decrease is primarily due to a billion increase in net payments on short term debt with original maturities greater than days  primarily driven by the parent s repayment of prior year borrowings under its revolving credit agreements rcas and an million net decrease in short term indebtedness  primarily driven by commercial paper repayments  partially offset by a million increase in proceeds from the issuance of common stock  primarily related to the parent s january common stock offering  a million increase in net proceeds from long term debt issuances due to the parent s combined billion issuances and pec s million issuance in compared to pef s billion issuance and pec s million issuance in  and a million decrease in payments at maturity of long term debt 
our our financing activities are described below 
on january   the parent issued million of senior notes due we expect to use the net proceeds  along with available cash on hand  to retire at maturity the million outstanding aggregate principal balance of our senior notes due march  on january   the parent paid at maturity million of its series a floating rate notes with a portion of the proceeds from the million of senior notes issued in november on march   pef issued million of first mortgage bonds due and million of first mortgage bonds due proceeds were used to repay the outstanding balance of pef s notes payable to affiliated companies  to repay the maturity of pef s million first mortgage bonds due june   and for general corporate purposes 
on october   pec and pef each entered into new million  three year rcas with a syndication of financial institutions 
the rcas are used to provide liquidity support for pec s and pef s issuances of commercial paper and other short term obligations  and for general corporate purposes 
the rcas will expire on october  the new million rcas replaced pec s and pef s million rcas  which were set to expire june  and march   respectively 
both million rcas were terminated effective october  see credit facilities and registration statements 
on october   the parent ratably reduced the size of its billion credit facility to million with the existing group of financial institutions see credit facilities and registration statements 
progress energy issued approximately million shares of common stock resulting in approximately million in proceeds from the progress energy investor plus plan ipp and its employee benefit and equity incentive plans 
included in these amounts were approximately million shares for proceeds of approximately million issued for the ipp 
for  the dividends paid on common stock were approximately million 
on january   the parent issued million shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
net proceeds from this offering were approximately million 
on february   the parent used million of the proceeds to reduce its million rca balance outstanding at december   and the remainder was used for general corporate purposes 
on january   pec issued million of first mortgage bonds  series due a portion of the proceeds was used to repay the maturity of pec s million senior notes  due march  the remaining proceeds were used to repay pec s outstanding short term debt and for general corporate purposes 
on march   the parent issued an aggregate million of senior notes consisting of million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due a portion of the proceeds was used to fund pef s capital expenditures through an equity contribution with the remaining proceeds used for general corporate purposes 
on june   pec entered into a seventy seventh supplemental indenture to its mortgage and deed of trust  dated may   as supplemented  in connection with certain amendments to the mortgage 
the amendments are set forth in the seventy seventh supplemental indenture and include an amendment to extend the maturity date of the mortgage by years 
the maturity date of the mortgage is now may  on november   the parent issued an aggregate million of senior notes consisting of million of senior notes due and million of senior notes due the proceeds were used to retire at maturity the million outstanding series a floating rate notes due january   to repay outstanding commercial paper balances  to pre fund a portion of the million aggregate principal amount due upon maturity of our senior notes due march   and for general corporate purposes 
during  we repaid the november million borrowing under our rca

on february   pef paid at maturity million of its first mortgage bonds with available cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings 
on march   pec and pef amended their rcas with a syndication of financial institutions to extend the termination date by one year 
the extensions were effective for both utilities on march  pec s rca was extended to june   and pef s rca was extended to march  these credit facilities were terminated on october  see credit facilities and registration statements 
on march   pec issued million of first mortgage bonds  series due the proceeds were used to repay the maturity of pec s million medium term notes  series d  due april   and the remainder was placed in temporary investments for general corporate use as needed

the redemption was funded with a portion of the proceeds from the june  debt issuance 
on november   the parent borrowed million under its rca to reduce rollover risk in the commercial paper markets 
the borrowing was repaid during on november   the parent  as a well known seasoned issuer  pec and pef filed a combined shelf registration statement with the sec  which became effective upon filing with the sec

included in these amounts were approximately million shares for proceeds of approximately million issued for the k and the ipp 
for  the dividends paid on common stock were approximately million 
short term debt at december   and at the end of each month during  progress energy had no outstanding short term debt 
future liquidity and capital resources please review safe harbor for forward looking statements and item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
the utilities produce substantially all of our consolidated cash from operations 
we anticipate that the utilities will continue to produce substantially all of the consolidated cash flows from operations over the next several years 
our discontinued synthetic fuels operations historically produced significant net earnings from the generation of tax credits see other matters synthetic fuels tax credits 
a portion of these tax credits has yet to be realized in cash due to the difference in timing of when tax credits are recognized for financial reporting purposes and realized for tax purposes 
at december   we have carried forward million of deferred tax credits 
realization of these tax credits is dependent upon our future taxable income  which is expected to be generated primarily by the utilities 
we expect to be able to meet our future liquidity needs through cash from operations  availability under our credit facilities and issuances of commercial paper and long term debt  which are dependent on our ability to successfully access capital markets 
credit rating downgrades could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and respond to major events such as hurricanes 
our cost of capital could also be higher  which could ultimately increase prices for our customers 
it is important for us to maintain our credit ratings and have access to the capital markets in order to reliably serve customers  invest in capital improvements and prepare for our customer s future energy needs see item a  risk factors 
we typically issue commercial paper to meet short term liquidity needs 
if liquidity conditions deteriorate and negatively impact the commercial paper market  we will need to evaluate other  potentially more expensive  options for meeting our short term liquidity needs  which may include borrowing under our rcas  issuing short term notes and or issuing long term debt 
on october   pec and pef entered into new three year rcas 
the parent s rca will expire in may  with the exception of approximately million that will expire in may see credit facilities and registration statements 
in the event we enter into a new credit facility for the parent  we cannot predict the terms  prices  duration or participants in such facility 
progress energy and its subsidiaries have approximately billion in outstanding long term debt  including the million current portion at december  currently  approximately million of the utilities debt obligations  approximately million at pec and approximately million at pef  are tax exempt auction rate securities insured by bond insurance 
these tax exempt bonds have experienced and continue to experience failed auctions 
assuming the failed auctions persist  future interest rate resets on our tax exempt auction rate bond portfolio will be dependent on the volatility experienced in the indices that dictate our interest rate resets and or rating agency actions that may lower our tax exempt bond ratings 
in the event of a two notch downgrade of pec s and or pef s senior secured debt rating by s p  the ratings of such utility s tax exempt bonds would be below a  most likely resulting in higher future interest rate resets 
in the event of a two notch downgrade by moody s  pec s tax exempt bonds will continue to be rated at or above a while pef s would be below a  most likely resulting in higher future interest rate resets for pef s tax exempt bonds 
we will continue to monitor this market and evaluate options to mitigate our exposure to future volatility 
the performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy future obligations under our defined benefit pension plans 
although a number of factors impact our pension funding requirements  a decline in the market value of these assets may significantly increase the future funding requirements of the obligations under our defined benefit pension plans 
we expect to make contributions of million to million directly to pension plan assets in see note 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources  capital expenditures  and in other matters environmental matters  over the long term  compliance with environmental regulations and meeting the anticipated load growth at the utilities as described under other matters energy demand will require the utilities to make significant capital investments 
we may pursue joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties in order to share some of the financing and operational risks associated with new baseload generation 
as discussed in other matters nuclear potential new construction  pef will postpone major capital expenditures for the levy project until after the nrc issues the col  which is expected to be in if the current licensing schedule remains on track 
certain of our hedge agreements may result in the receipt of  or posting of  derivative collateral with our counterparties  depending on the daily derivative position 
fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to our return of collateral received and or our posting of collateral with our counterparties negatively impact our liquidity 
substantially all derivative commodity instrument positions are subject to retail regulatory treatment 
after settlement of the derivatives and consumption of the fuel  any realized gains or losses are passed through the fuel cost recovery clause 
changes in natural gas prices and settlements of financial hedge agreements since december   have impacted the amount of collateral posted with counterparties 
at december   we had posted approximately million of cash collateral compared to million of cash collateral posted at december  the majority of our financial hedge agreements will settle in and additional commodity market price decreases could result in significant increases in the derivative collateral that we are required to post with counterparties 
we continually monitor our derivative positions in relation to market price activity 
as discussed in note c  credit rating downgrades could also require us to post additional cash collateral for commodity hedges in a liability position as certain derivative instruments require us to post collateral on liability positions based on our credit ratings 
the amount and timing of future sales of debt securities will depend on market conditions  operating cash flow and our specific liquidity needs 
we may from time to time sell securities beyond the amount immediately needed to meet our capital or liquidity requirements in order to prefund our expected maturity schedule  to allow for the early redemption of long term debt  the redemption of preferred stock  the reduction of short term debt or for other corporate purposes 
at december   the current portion of our long term debt was million  including million at pef 
we expect to fund the parent s million of senior notes due march  with a combination of available cash on hand and net proceeds of million from the parent s issuance of million of senior notes on january  accordingly  we classified million of the parent s million senior notes due march  as long term debt at december  we expect to fund pef s million current portion of long term debt with a combination of cash from operations  commercial paper borrowings and or long term debt 
regulatory matters and recovery of costs regulatory matters  including nuclear cost recovery  as discussed in note and other matters regulatory environment  and recovery of environmental costs  as discussed in note and in other matters environmental matters  may impact our future liquidity and financing activities 
the impacts of these matters  including the timing of recoveries from ratepayers  can be both a source of and a use of future liquidity resources 
energy legislation enacted in recent years may impact our liquidity over the long term  including  among others  provisions regarding cost recovery  mandated renewable portfolio standards  dsm and ee 
regulatory developments expected to have a material impact on our liquidity are discussed below 
pec cost recovery clause on june   the scpsc approved pec s request for a decrease in the fuel rate charged to its south carolina ratepayers 
the million decrease  effective july   is driven by declining fuel prices 
on november   the ncuc approved pec s request for a decrease in the fuel rate charged to its north carolina ratepayers 
the million decrease  effective december   is also driven by declining fuel prices 
also on november   the ncuc approved pec s request for an increase in the dsm and ee rate charges to its north carolina ratepayers 
the million increase was effective december  pec other matters the ncuc has issued certificates of public convenience and necessity allowing pec to proceed with plans to construct an approximately mw generating facility at its richmond county generation site projected to be in service by june  an approximately mw generating facility at a site in wayne county  nc  projected to be in service by january  and an approximately mw generating facility at a site in new hanover county  nc  projected to be in service by december pef base rates on june   the fpsc approved a settlement agreement between pef and the interveners  with the exception of the florida association for fairness in ratemaking  to the rate case 
as part of the settlement  pef withdrew its motion for reconsideration of the rate case order 
among other provisions  under the terms of the settlement agreement  pef will maintain base rates at current levels through the last billing cycle of among other provisions  the settlement agreement also authorized pef the opportunity to earn a return on equity roe of up to percent and provides that if pef s actual retail base rate earnings fall below a percent roe on an adjusted or pro forma basis  as reported on a historical month basis during the term of the agreement  pef may seek general  limited or interim base rate relief  or any combination thereof  subject to certain conditions 
the settlement agreement does not preclude pef from requesting the fpsc to approve the recovery of costs a that are of a type which traditionally and historically would be  have been or are presently recovered through cost recovery clauses or surcharges  or b that are incremental costs not currently recovered in base rates  which the legislature or fpsc determines are clause recoverable  or c which are recoverable through base rates under the nuclear cost recovery legislation or the fpsc s nuclear cost recovery rule 
finally  pef will be allowed to recover the costs of named storms on an expedited basis after depletion of the storm damage reserve 
specifically  days following the filing of a cost recovery petition with the fpsc and based on a month recovery period  pef can begin recovery  subject to refund  through a surcharge of up to per  kwh on monthly residential customer bills for storm costs 
in the event the storm costs exceed that level  any excess additional costs will be deferred and recovered in a subsequent year or years as determined by the fpsc 
additionally  the order approving the settlement agreement allows pef to use the surcharge to replenish the storm damage reserve to million  the level as of june   after storm costs are fully recovered 
pef fuel cost recovery on november   pef filed a request with the fpsc to seek approval to decrease the total fuel cost recovery by million 
this decrease is due to a decrease for the projected recovery through the capacity cost recovery clause ccrc and for the projected recovery of fuel costs 
the decrease in the ccrc is primarily due to the refund of a prior period over recovery as a result of higher than expected sales in and lower anticipated costs associated with pef s proposed levy units and nuclear power plants levy in see other matters nuclear potential new construction 
the decrease in the projected recovery of fuel costs is due to lower expected fuel costs  partially offset by an under recovery of fuel costs 
on november  and november   the fpsc approved pef s ccrc residential rate and fuel rate  respectively 
pef nuclear cost recovery pef is allowed to recover prudently incurred site selection costs  preconstruction costs and the carrying cost on construction cost balances on an annual basis through the ccrc 
such amounts will not be included in pef s rate base when the plant is placed in commercial operation 
the nuclear cost recovery rule also has a provision to recover costs should the project be abandoned after the utility receives a final order granting a determination of need 
these costs include any unrecovered construction work in progress at the time of abandonment and any other prudent and reasonable exit costs 
in addition  the rule requires the fpsc to conduct an annual prudence review of the reasonableness and prudence of all such costs  including construction costs  and such determination shall not be subject to later review except upon a finding of fraud  intentional misrepresentation or the intentional withholding of key information by the utility 
in  pursuant to the fpsc nuclear cost recovery rule  pef filed a petition to recover million through the ccrc  which primarily consisted of preconstruction and carrying costs incurred or anticipated to be incurred during and the projected costs associated with the levy and cr uprate projects 
in an effort to help mitigate the initial price impact on its customers  pef proposed and the fpsc approved collecting certain costs over a five year period  with associated carrying costs on the unrecovered balance 
in adopting pef s proposed rate management plan for  the fpsc permitted pef to annually reconsider changes to the recovery of deferred amounts to afford greater flexibility to manage future rate impacts 
the rate management plan included the reclassification to the nuclear cost recovery clause regulatory asset of million of capacity revenues and the accelerated amortization of million of preconstruction costs 
the cumulative amount of million was recorded as a nuclear cost recovery regulatory asset at december   and is projected to be recovered by on october   the fpsc approved pef s annual nuclear cost recovery filing with the fpsc to recover million  which includes recovery of preconstruction  carrying and ccrc recoverable o m costs incurred or anticipated to be incurred during  recovery of million of the deferral in  as well as the estimated true up of costs associated with the levy and cr uprate projects beginning with the first january billing cycle 
additionally  the fpsc approved the prudence of the costs associated with the levy project 
the final order was issued on february  cr outage pef maintains insurance coverage against incremental costs of replacement power resulting from prolonged accidental outages at cr through neil see note d 
neil has confirmed that the cr delamination event is a covered accident 
pef is continuing to work with neil for recovery of applicable repair costs and associated replacement power costs 
the following table summarizes the cr replacement power and repair costs and recovery through december  in millions replacement power costs repair costs spent to date neil proceeds received insurance receivable at december  balance for recovery pef considers replacement power and capital costs not recoverable through insurance to be recoverable through its fuel cost recovery clause or base rates 
pef accrued million of replacement power cost reimbursements after the deductible period  which reduced the portion of the deferred fuel regulatory asset related to the extended cr outage to million at december  additional replacement power costs and repair and maintenance costs incurred until cr is returned to service could be material 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
pef demand side management cost recovery on december   the fpsc ordered pef and other florida utilities to adopt dsm goals based on enhanced measures  which will result in significantly higher conservation goals 
as subsequently revised by the fpsc  pef s aggregate conservation goals over the next years were  summer mw   winter mw  and  gigawatt hours gwh 
on march   pef filed a petition for approval of its proposed dsm plan and to authorize cost recovery through the eccr 
on september   the fpsc held an agenda conference to approve pef s petition for the dsm plan 
the fpsc ruled that while pef s proposed dsm plan met the cumulative  year dsm goals set by the fpsc  the plan did not meet the annual dsm goals 
on october   the fpsc denied pef s petition for the dsm plan  approved pef s solar pilot programs  and required pef to file a revised proposed dsm plan that meets the annual goals set by the fpsc 
pef filed a revised proposed dsm plan on november   which would result in  gwh of energy savings from  seven times more than pef s historic goals 
an agenda conference has been scheduled by the fpsc for april  we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
pef other matters on november   the fpsc approved pef s request to decrease the ecrc by million  effective january  the decrease in the ecrc is primarily due to the base rate decision  which reduced the clean air project depreciation and return rates  and the refund of a prior period over recovery as a result of higher than expected sales in capital expenditures we expect to make significant capital investments to meet anticipated load growth and environmental standards 
we are currently constructing new generating facilities in the carolinas and potentially will construct new baseload generating facilities in the carolinas and florida that will be placed in service toward the middle of the next decade 
total cash from operations and proceeds from long term debt and equity issuances provided the funding for our capital expenditures  including environmental compliance and other utility property additions  nuclear fuel expenditures and non utility property additions  during as shown in the table that follows  we expect the majority of our capital expenditures to be incurred at our regulated operations 
we expect to fund our capital requirements primarily through a combination of cash from operations and long term debt financings 
in addition  we have billion in credit facilities that support the issuance of commercial paper 
access to the commercial paper market provides additional liquidity to help meet our working capital requirements

potential nuclear construction expenditures  which are primarily for pef s levy  include development  engineering  licensing  land acquisition and equipment 
forecasted potential nuclear construction expenditures are dependent upon  and may vary significantly based upon  the decision to build  regulatory approval schedules  timing and escalation of project costs  and the percentages of joint ownership 
because of announced schedule shifts  we negotiated an amendment to the levy epc agreement see discussion under other matters nuclear potential new construction 
the forecasted capital expenditures presented in the previous table reflect the announced schedule shift 
additionally  in light of the schedule shifts in the levy nuclear project  pef may incur fees and charges related to the disposition of outstanding purchase orders on long lead time equipment  which could be material 
in june  pef completed its long lead time equipment disposition analysis to minimize the impact associated with the schedule shift 
as a result of the analysis  pef will continue with selected components of the long lead time equipment 
work has been suspended on the remaining long lead time equipment items and pef has been in suspension negotiations with the selected equipment vendors  which we anticipate concluding by the end of the first quarter of potential nuclear construction expenditures are subject to cost recovery provisions in the utilities respective jurisdictions 
all projected capital and investment expenditures are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly depending on a number of factors including  but not limited to  industry restructuring  regulatory constraints  market volatility and economic trends 
credit facilities and registration statements at december  and  we had committed lines of credit used to support our commercial paper borrowings 
at december  and  we had no outstanding borrowings under our credit facilities

additionally  on december   the parent had million of outstanding commercial paper supported by the rca 
b approximately million of the million will expire may  all of the revolving credit facilities were arranged through a syndication of financial institutions 
see note for additional discussion of our credit facilities 
the rcas provide liquidity support for issuances of commercial paper and other short term obligations 
we expect to continue to use commercial paper issuances as a source of liquidity as long as we maintain our current short term ratings 
fees and interest rates under our rcas are based upon the respective credit ratings of the parent s  pec s and pef s long term unsecured senior noncredit enhanced debt 
all of the credit facilities include defined maximum total debt to total capital ratio leverage covenants  which we were in compliance with at december  we are currently in compliance and expect to continue to be in compliance with these covenants 
see note for a discussion of the credit facilities financial covenants 
at december   the calculated ratios for the progress registrants  pursuant to the terms of the agreements  are as disclosed in note the parent  as a well known seasoned issuer  has on file with the sec a shelf registration statement under which it may issue an unlimited number or amount of various securities  including senior debt securities  junior subordinated debentures  common stock  preferred stock  stock purchase contracts  stock purchase units  and trust preferred securities and guarantees 
both pec and pef have on file with the sec shelf registration statements under which they may issue an unlimited number or amount of various long term debt securities and preferred stock

total equity preferred stock total debt credit rating matters our credit ratings reflect the current views of the rating agencies  and no assurances can be given that our ratings will continue for any given period of time 
however  we monitor our financial condition as well as market conditions that could ultimately affect our credit ratings 
credit rating downgrades could negatively impact our ability to access the capital markets and respond to major events such as hurricanes 
our cost of capital could also be higher  which could ultimately increase prices for our customers 
it is important for us to maintain our credit ratings and have access to the capital markets in order to reliably serve customers  invest in capital improvements and prepare for our customer s future energy needs see item a  risk factors 
as discussed in note c  credit rating downgrades could also require us to post additional cash collateral for commodity hedges in a liability position as certain derivative instruments require us to post collateral on liability positions based on our credit ratings 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations our off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations are described below 
guarantees as a part of normal business  we enter into various agreements providing future financial or performance assurances to third parties 
these agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to progress energy or our subsidiaries on a stand alone basis  thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiaries intended commercial purposes 
our guarantees include standby letters of credit  surety bonds  performance obligations for trading operations and guarantees of certain subsidiary credit obligations 
at december   we have issued million of guarantees for future financial or performance assurance  including million at pec 
included in this amount is million of guarantees of certain payments of two wholly owned indirect subsidiaries issued by the parent see note 
we do not believe conditions are likely for significant performance under the guarantees of performance issued by or on behalf of affiliates 
at december   we have issued guarantees and indemnifications of certain asset performance  legal  tax and environmental matters to third parties  including indemnifications made in connection with sales of businesses  and for timely payment of obligations in support of our nonwholly owned synthetic fuels operations as discussed in note c 
market risk and derivatives under our risk management policy  we may use a variety of instruments  including swaps  options and forward contracts  to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
see note and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of market risk and derivatives 
contractual obligations we are party to numerous contracts and arrangements obligating us to make cash payments in future years 
these contracts include financial arrangements such as debt agreements and leases  as well as contracts for the purchase of goods and services 
in most cases  these contracts contain provisions for price adjustments  minimum purchase levels and other financial commitments 
the commitment amounts presented in the following table are estimates and therefore will likely differ from actual purchase amounts 
further disclosure regarding our contractual obligations is included in the respective notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we take into consideration the future commitments when assessing our liquidity and future financing needs

b interest payments on long term debt are based on the interest rate effective at december  c amounts include certain related executory cost commitments 
d essentially all fuel and certain purchased power costs incurred by the utilities are eligible for recovery through cost recovery clauses in accordance with state and federal regulations and therefore do not require separate liquidity support 
amounts exclude precedent and conditional contracts of billion  including billion for pec and billion for pef and an approximately million levy nuclear fuel fabrication contract 
see note a and the other purchase obligations discussion following in e 
e amounts exclude an epc agreement that pef entered into in december for two nuclear units planned for construction at levy 
as disclosed in other matters nuclear potential new construction  the epc agreement includes provisions for termination 
for termination without cause  the epc agreement contains exit provisions with termination fees  which may be significant  that vary based on the termination circumstances 
we executed an amendment to the epc agreement in due to the schedule shifts that will postpone major construction activities on the project until after the nrc issues the combined license col  which is expected to be in  if the licensing schedule remains on track 
prior to the amendment  estimated payments and associated escalations were billion for the multi year contract and did not assume any joint ownership 
because we have executed an amendment to the epc agreement and anticipate negotiating additional amendments upon receipt of the col  we cannot currently predict the timing of when those obligations will be satisfied or the magnitude of any change 
additionally  in light of the schedule shifts in the levy nuclear project  pef may incur fees and charges related to the disposition of outstanding purchase orders on long lead time equipment for the levy nuclear project  which could be material 
in june  pef completed its long lead time equipment disposition analysis to minimize the impact associated with the schedule shift 
as a result of the analysis  pef will continue with selected components of the long lead time equipment 
work has been suspended on the remaining long lead time equipment items  which have total remaining estimated payments and associated escalations of approximately billion included in the previously discussed billion 
pef has been in suspension negotiations with the selected equipment vendors  which we anticipate concluding by the end of the first quarter of in its april  nuclear cost recovery filing  pef included for rate making purposes a point estimate of potential levy disposition fees and charges of million  subject to true up 
however  the amount of disposition fees and charges  if any  cannot be determined until suspension negotiations are completed 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
f represents the projected minimum required contributions to the qualified pension trusts for a total of years 
these amounts are subject to change significantly based on factors such as pension asset earnings and market interest rates 
g represents projected benefit payments for a total of years related to our postretirement health and life plans and are subject to change based on factors such as experienced claims and general health care cost trends 
h uncertain tax positions of million are not reflected in this table as we cannot predict when open income tax years will close with completed examinations 
it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by up to approximately million during the month period ending december   due to expected settlements 
i by ncuc order  in  pec began transitioning north carolina jurisdictional amounts currently retained internally to its external decommissioning funds 
the transition of the original million must be complete by december   and at least percent must be transitioned each year 
other matters regulatory environment the utilities operations in north carolina  south carolina and florida are regulated by the ncuc  the scpsc and the fpsc  respectively 
the utilities are also subject to regulation by the ferc  the nrc and other federal and state agencies common to the utility business 
as a result of regulation  many of the fundamental business decisions  as well as the rate of return the utilities are permitted the opportunity to earn  are subject to the approval of one or more of these governmental agencies 
to our knowledge  there is currently no enacted or proposed legislation in north carolina  south carolina or florida that would give retail ratepayers the right to choose their electricity provider or otherwise restructure or deregulate the electric industry 
we cannot anticipate if any of these states will move to increase retail competition in the electric industry 
current retail rate matters affected by state regulatory authorities are discussed in notes b and c 
this discussion identifies specific retail rate matters  the status of the issues and the associated effects on our consolidated financial statements 
on april   we accepted a grant from the united states department of energy doe for million in federal matching infrastructure funds 
in addition to providing the utilities real time information about the state of their electric grids  the smart grid transition will enable customers to better understand and manage their energy use  and will provide for more efficient integration of renewable energy resources 
supplementing the doe grant  the utilities will invest more than million in smart grid projects  which include enhancements to distribution equipment  installation of  additional smart meters and additional public infrastructure for plug in electric vehicles 
projects funded by the grant must be completed by april through december   we have incurred million of allowable  percent reimbursable  smart grid project costs  and have submitted to the doe requests for reimbursement of million  of which we have received million reimbursement 
concerns about climate change and oil price volatility have led to proposed and enacted legislation at the federal and state levels to increase renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas ghg emissions 
the north carolina renewable energy and energy efficiency portfolio standard nc reps requires pec to file an annual compliance report with the ncuc demonstrating the actions it has taken to comply with the nc reps requirement 
the rules measure compliance with the nc reps requirement via renewable energy certificates earned after january  north carolina electric power suppliers with a renewable energy compliance obligation  including pec  are participating in the renewable energy certificate tracking system  which came online july  north carolina law mandates that utilities achieve a targeted amount of energy from specified renewable energy resources or implementation of energy efficiency measures beginning with a percent requirement in escalating to percent in pec expects to be in compliance with this requirement 
in  the governor of florida issued executive orders to address reduction of ghg emissions 
the executive orders include adoption of a maximum allowable emissions level of ghgs for florida utilities  which will require  at a minimum  the following three reduction milestones by  emissions not greater than year utility sector emissions  by  emissions not greater than year utility sector emissions  and by  emissions not greater than percent of year utility sector emissions 
the executive orders also requested that the fpsc initiate a rulemaking that would require florida utilities to produce at least percent of their electricity from renewable sources  reduce the cost of connecting solar and other renewable energy technologies to florida s power grid by adopting uniform statewide interconnection standards for all utilities  and authorize a uniform  statewide method to enable residential and commercial customers who generate electricity from onsite renewable technologies of up to mw in capacity to offset their consumption over a billing period by allowing their electric meters to turn backward when they generate electricity net metering 
in response to the executive orders  florida energy law enacted in includes provisions that required the fpsc to develop a renewable portfolio standard that the fpsc would present to the legislature for ratification and also includes provisions that direct the florida department of environmental protection fdep to develop rules establishing a cap and trade program to regulate ghg emissions that the fdep would present to the legislature no earlier than january for ratification 
to date  the florida legislature has not ratified or enacted any renewable portfolio standard or cap and trade rules or programs 
until these agency actions are finalized  we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
our balanced solution  as described in energy demand  includes greater investment in energy efficiency  renewable energy and a state of the art power system and demonstrates our commitment to environmental responsibility 
energy demand implementing state and federal energy policies  promoting environmental stewardship and providing reliable electricity to meet the anticipated long term growth within the utilities service territories will require a balanced approach 
the three main elements of this balanced solution are expanding our dsm and ee programs  investing in the development of alternative energy resources for the future  and operating a state of the art power system 
we are continuing the expansion and enhancement of our dsm and ee programs because energy efficiency is one of the most effective ways to reduce energy costs  offset the need for new power plants and protect the environment 
dsm programs include programs and initiatives that shift the timing of electricity use from peak to nonpeak periods  such as load management  electricity system and operating controls  direct load control  interruptible load  and electric system equipment and operating controls 
our previously discussed smart grid projects will aid in these initiatives 
ee programs include any equipment  physical or program change that results in less energy used to perform the same function 
we provide our residential customers with home energy audits and offer ee programs that provide incentives for customers to implement measures that reduce energy use 
for business customers  we also provide energy audits and other tools  including an interactive internet website with online calculators  programs and efficiency tips  to help them reduce their energy use 
we are actively engaged in a variety of alternative energy projects to pursue the generation of electricity from swine waste and other plant or animal sources  biomass  solar  hydrogen and landfill gas technologies 
among our projects  we have executed contracts to purchase approximately mw of electricity generated from biomass 
this number includes mw of biomass toward compliance with nc reps 
the majority of these projects should be online within the next five years 
in addition  we have executed purchased power agreements for approximately mw of electricity generated from solar photovoltaic generation as part of the nc reps 
more than half of these projects are online and the remainder should be online by the end of additionally  customers across our service territory have connected approximately mw of solar photovoltaic energy systems to our grid 
in june  we expanded our solar energy strategy to include a range of new solar incentives and programs  which are expected to significantly increase our use of solar energy over the next decade 
we are pursuing numerous options to create a state of the art power system  including investments in smart grid technology and advanced environmental controls on our coal fired plants 
in the coming years  we will continue to invest in existing nuclear plants and evaluate plans for building or co owning new generating plants 
due to the anticipated long term growth in our service territories  retirement of existing coal generation and potential changes in environmental regulations  we are constructing new natural gas fueled generating facilities in the carolinas and we estimate that we will require new generating facilities in both florida and the carolinas in the first half of the next decade 
in addition to nuclear generation  we are evaluating natural gas fired plants  renewable generation resources  energy efficiency initiatives and economic purchased power to meet this increased need 
at this time  no definitive decisions have been made to construct or when to construct our proposed new nuclear plants see nuclear potential new construction or to acquire new generation from another utility s regional nuclear project 
in the near term  we will focus our efforts on modernizing the power system and pursuing all elements of a balanced portfolio while looking to new nuclear capacity as a critical part of the long term mix 
in  pec announced a coal to gas modernization strategy whereby the remaining coal fired generating facilities in north carolina that do not have scrubbers would be retired prior to the end of their useful lives and their approximately  mw of generating capacity replaced with new natural gas fueled facilities 
the original strategy called for the retirement of the coal fired units by the end of  however  we currently expect the plants will be retired no later than the end of pec has received approval from the ncuc for construction of an approximately mw natural gas fueled generating facility at a site in wayne county  nc  to be placed in service in january pec has also received approval from the ncuc to construct an approximately mw natural gas fueled generating facility at a site in new hanover county  nc  to replace the existing coal fired generation at this site 
the facility is projected to be placed in service in december after  pec will continue to operate its roxboro  mayo and asheville coal fired plants in north carolina  which have state of the art emission controls 
emissions of nox  sulfur dioxide so  mercury and other pollutants have been reduced significantly at these sites 
in recent years  the federal government has authorized loan guarantee programs for innovative energy projects as well as newly constructed nuclear facilities 
pef decided not to pursue the loan guarantee program for the levy project 
however  this decision does not preclude pef from revisiting the program at a later date if there are changes to the program 
we cannot predict if pef will pursue this program further 
nuclear nuclear generating units are regulated by the nrc 
in the event of noncompliance  the nrc has the authority to impose fines  set license conditions  shut down a nuclear unit or take some combination of these actions  depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation  until compliance is achieved 
our nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate normal refueling and maintenance outages  repairs  uprates and certain other modifications 
in september  cr began an outage for normal refueling and maintenance  as well as its uprate project to increase its generating capacity and to replace two steam generators 
during preparations to replace the steam generators  we discovered a delamination within the concrete of the outer wall of the containment structure  which has resulted in an extension of the outage 
after a comprehensive analysis  we have determined that the concrete delamination at cr was caused by redistribution of stresses on the containment wall that occurred when we created an opening to accommodate the replacement of the unit s steam generators 
we expect to complete repairs in march  and return the unit to service following successful completion of post repair testing and start up activities in april nuclear safety remains our top priority  and our plans and actions will continue to reflect that commitment 
a number of factors affect the return to service date  including regulatory reviews by the nrc and other agencies  emergent work  final engineering designs  testing  weather and other developments see note c 
pec s nuclear units have operating licenses granted by the nrc that have been extended to and the nrc operating license held by pef for cr currently expires in december on march   the nrc docketed  or accepted for review  pef s application for a year renewal on the operating license for cr  which would extend the operating license through  if approved 
docketing the application does not preclude additional requests for information as the review proceeds  nor does it indicate whether the nrc will renew the license 
the license renewal application for cr is currently under review by the nrc with a decision expected in potential new construction while we have not made a final determination on nuclear construction  we continue to take steps to keep open the option of building a plant or plants 
during  pec and pef filed col applications to potentially construct new nuclear plants in north carolina and florida see item a  risk factors 
the nrc estimates that it will take approximately three to four years to review and process the col applications 
we have focused on the potential nuclear plant construction in florida given the need for more fuel diversity in florida and anticipated federal and state policies to reduce ghg emissions as well as existing state legislative policy that is supportive of nuclear projects 
in  we announced that pef selected levy to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion 
we selected the westinghouse electric ap reactor design as the technology upon which to base pef s application submission 
in  pef completed the purchase of approximately  acres for levy and associated transmission needs 
on july   pef filed its col application with the nrc for two reactors 
pef also completed and submitted a limited work authorization request for levy concurrent with the col application 
the fpsc issued the final order granting pef s petition for the determination of need for levy on august  on october   the nrc docketed the levy nuclear project application 
on february   pef received the nrc s schedule for review and approval of the col 
pef s initial schedule anticipated performing certain site work pursuant to the limited work authorization prior to col receipt 
however  in  the nrc staff determined that certain schedule critical work that pef had proposed to perform within the scope of the limited work authorization will not be authorized until the nrc issues the col 
consequently  excavation and foundation preparation work will be shifted until after col issuance 
this factor alone resulted in a minimum month schedule shift later than the originally anticipated timeframe 
since then  regulatory and economic conditions have changed  resulting in additional schedule shifts 
these conditions include the permitting and licensing process  national and state economic conditions  recent fpsc dsm goals and the resulting impact on ratepayers  and other fpsc decisions 
uncertainty regarding pef s access to capital on reasonable terms  pef s ability to secure joint owners and increasing uncertainty surrounding carbon regulation and its costs could be other factors to affect the levy schedule 
pef signed the epc agreement on december   with westinghouse electric company llc and stone webster  inc for two westinghouse ap nuclear units to be constructed at levy 
more than half of the approximate billion contract price is fixed or firm with agreed upon escalation factors 
the epc agreement includes various incentives  warranties  performance guarantees  liquidated damage provisions and parent guarantees designed to incent the contractor to perform efficiently 
for termination without cause  the epc agreement contains exit provisions with termination fees  which may be significant  that vary based on the termination circumstances 
we executed an amendment to the epc agreement in due to the schedule shifts previously discussed 
additionally  in light of the schedule shifts in the levy nuclear project  pef may incur fees and charges related to the disposition of outstanding purchase orders on long lead time equipment for the levy nuclear project  which could be material 
in june  pef completed its long lead time equipment disposition analysis to minimize the impact associated with the schedule shift 
as a result of the analysis  pef will continue with selected components of the long lead time equipment 
work has been suspended on the remaining long lead time equipment items and pef has been in suspension negotiations with the selected equipment vendors  which we anticipate concluding by the end of the first quarter of in its april  nuclear cost recovery filing  pef included for rate making purposes a point estimate of potential levy disposition fees and charges of million  subject to true up 
however  the amount of disposition fees and charges  if any  cannot be determined until suspension negotiations are completed 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
the total escalated cost for the two generating units was estimated in pef s petition for the determination of need for levy to be approximately billion 
this total cost estimate included land  plant components  financing costs  construction  labor  regulatory fees and the initial core for the two units 
an additional billion was estimated for the necessary transmission equipment and approximately miles of transmission lines associated with the project 
pef s nuclear cost recovery filing included an updated analysis that demonstrated continued feasibility of the levy project with pef s current estimated range of total escalated cost  including transmission  of billion to billion 
the filed estimated cost range primarily reflects cost escalation resulting from the schedule shifts 
many factors will affect the total cost of the project and once pef receives the col  it will further refine the project timeline and budget 
as previously discussed  we continue to evaluate the levy project on an ongoing basis 
in  we announced that pec selected a site at harris to evaluate for possible future nuclear expansion 
we selected the westinghouse electric ap reactor design as the technology upon which to base pec s application submission 
on february   pec filed its col application with the nrc for two additional reactors at harris 
on april   the nrc docketed the harris application 
if we receive approval from the nrc and applicable state agencies  and if the decisions to build are made  a new plant would not be online until the middle of the next decade see energy demand above 
spent nuclear fuel matters the nuclear waste policy act of provides the framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities for high level radioactive waste materials 
the nuclear waste policy act of promotes increased usage of interim storage of spent nuclear fuel at existing nuclear plants 
we will continue to maximize the use of spent fuel storage capability within our own facilities for as long as feasible 
with certain modifications and additional approvals by the nrc  including the installation and or expansion of on site dry cask storage facilities at robinson  brunswick and cr  the utilities spent nuclear fuel storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space for spent fuel generated on their respective systems through the expiration of the operating licenses  including any license renewals  for their nuclear generating units 
harris has sufficient storage capacity through the expiration of its renewed operating licenses 
see note d for discussion of the status of the utilities contracts with the doe for spent nuclear fuel storage 
environmental matters we are subject to regulation by various federal  state and local authorities in the areas of air quality  water quality  control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes  and other environmental matters 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with those environmental regulations currently applicable to our business and operations and believe we have all necessary permits to conduct such operations 
environmental laws and regulations frequently change and the ultimate costs of compliance cannot always be precisely estimated 
hazardous and solid waste management the provisions of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  as amended cercla  authorize the epa to require the cleanup of hazardous waste sites 
this statute imposes retroactive joint and several liability 
some states  including north carolina  south carolina and florida  have similar types of statutes 
we are periodically notified by regulators  including the epa and various state agencies  of our involvement or potential involvement in sites that may require investigation and or remediation 
there are presently several sites with respect to which we have been notified of our potential liability by the epa  the state of north carolina  the state of florida or potentially responsible parties prp groups 
various organic materials associated with the production of manufactured gas  generally referred to as coal tar  are regulated under federal and state laws 
pec and pef are each prps at several manufactured gas plant mgp sites 
we are also currently in the process of assessing potential costs and exposures at other sites 
these costs are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses see notes and 
both pec and pef evaluate potential claims against other prps and insurance carriers and plan to submit claims for cost recovery where appropriate 
the outcome of potential and pending claims cannot be predicted 
hazardous and solid waste management matters are discussed in detail in note a 
we accrue costs to the extent our liability is probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated 
because the extent of environmental impact  allocation among prps for all sites  remediation alternatives which could involve either minimal or significant efforts  and concurrence of the regulatory authorities have not yet reached the stage where a reasonable estimate of the remediation costs can be made  we cannot determine the total costs that may be incurred in connection with the remediation of all sites at this time 
it is probable that current estimates could change and additional losses  which could be material  may be incurred in the future 
in  the epa evaluated information about ash impoundment dams nationwide and developed a listing of utility ash impoundment dams considered to have high hazard potential  including two of pec s ash impoundment dams 
a high hazard potential rating is not related to the stability of those ash ponds but to the potential for harm should the impoundment dam fail 
all of the dams at pec s coal ash ponds have been subject to periodic third party inspection for many years in accordance with prior applicable requirements 
the epa rated the high hazard potential impoundments  as well as other impoundments  from unsatisfactory to satisfactory based on their structural integrity and associated documentation 
only dams rated as unsatisfactory would be considered to pose an immediate safety threat 
none of the facilities received an unsatisfactory rating from the epa 
in total  six of pec s ash pond dams  including one high hazard potential impoundment  were rated as poor based on the contract inspector s desire to see additional documentation and evaluations of vegetation management and minor erosion control 
inspectors applied the same criteria to both active and inactive ash ponds  despite the fact that most of the inactive ash impoundments no longer hold water and do not pose a risk of breaching and spilling 
pec has completed several of the epa s recommendations for the active ponds and other recommended actions are under way 
following evaluations and inspections  engineers have determined that one ash pond dam requires modifications to comply with current standards for an extra margin of safety for slope stability 
design and permitting efforts for that work have been initiated 
pec is working with the north carolina dam safety program to evaluate the remaining recommendations 
we do not expect mitigation of these issues to have a material impact on our results of operations 
as of january   dams at utility fossil fired power plants in north carolina  including dams for ash ponds  are subject to the north carolina dam safety act s applicable provisions  including state inspection 
those provisions are under the purview of the north carolina division of land resources 
the division has completed its initial inspections of all of pec s dams 
no significant issues were found 
the epa and a number of states are considering additional regulatory measures that may affect management  treatment  marketing and disposal of coal combustion residues  primarily ash  from each of the utilities coal fired plants 
revised or new laws or regulations under consideration may impose changes in solid waste classifications or groundwater protection environmental controls 
on june   the epa proposed two options for new rules to regulate coal combustion residues 
the first option would create a comprehensive program of federally enforceable requirements for coal combustion residue management and disposal as hazardous waste 
the other option would have the epa set performance standards for coal combustion residues management facilities and regulate disposal of coal combustion residues as nonhazardous waste 
the epa did not identify a preferred option 
under both options  the epa may leave in place a regulatory exemption for approved beneficial uses of coal combustion residuals that are recycled 
a final rule is expected in late or compliance plans and estimated costs to meet the requirements of new regulations will be determined when any new regulations are finalized 
we are also evaluating the effect on groundwater quality from past and current operations  which may result in operational changes and additional measures under existing regulations 
these issues are also under evaluation by state agencies 
certain regulated chemicals have been measured in wells near our ash ponds at levels above groundwater quality standards 
additional monitoring and investigation will be conducted 
detailed plans and cost estimates will be determined if these evaluations reveal that corrective actions are necessary 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
air quality and water quality we are  or may ultimately be  subject to various current and proposed federal  state and local environmental compliance laws and regulations  which likely would result in increased capital expenditures and o m expenses 
additionally  congress may be considering legislation that would require reductions in air emissions of nox  so  carbon dioxide co and mercury 
some proposals establish nationwide caps and emission rates over an extended period of time 
this national multipollutant approach to air pollution control could involve significant capital costs that could be material to our financial position or results of operations 
control equipment installed pursuant to the provisions of cair  clean air visibility rule cavr and mercury regulations  which are discussed below  may address some of the issues outlined previously 
pec and pef have been developing an integrated compliance strategy to meet the requirements of the cair  cavr and mercury regulation see discussion of the court decisions that impacted the cair  the delisting determination and the clean air mercury rule 
camr 
below 
the cavr requires the installation of best available retrofit technology bart on certain units 
however  the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted 
clean smokestacks act in  the clean smokestacks act was enacted in north carolina requiring the state electric utilities to reduce the emissions of nox and so from their north carolina coal fired power plants in phases by pec currently has approximately  mw of coal fired generation capacity in north carolina affected by the clean smokestacks act 
pec s environmental compliance projects under the first phase of clean smokestacks act emission reductions have been placed in service 
pec plans to retire by the end of  its remaining coal fired generating facilities in north carolina totaling  mw that do not have scrubbers and replace the generation capacity with new natural gas fueled generating facilities  which should enable the utility to comply with the final clean smokestacks act so emissions target that begins in we are continuing to evaluate various design  technology  generation and fuel options that could change expenditures required to maintain compliance with the clean smokestacks act limits subsequent to o m expense increases with the operation of pollution control equipment due to the cost of reagents  additional personnel and general maintenance associated with the pollution control equipment 
pec is allowed to recover the cost of reagents and certain other costs under its fuel clause  the north carolina retail portion of all other o m expense is currently recoverable through base rates 
in  the scpsc issued an order allowing pec to begin deferring as a regulatory asset the depreciation expense that pec incurs on its environmental compliance control facilities as well as the incremental o m expenses that pec incurs in connection with its environmental compliance control facilities 
clean air interstate rule the cair  issued by the epa  required the district of columbia and states  including north carolina  south carolina and florida  to reduce nox and so emissions 
the cair set emission limits to be met in two phases beginning in and  respectively  for nox and beginning in and  respectively  for so states were required to adopt rules implementing the cair  and the epa approved the north carolina cair  the south carolina cair and the florida cair 
the air quality controls installed to comply with nox requirements under certain sections of the clean air act caa and the clean smokestacks act  as well as pec s plan to replace a portion of its coal fired generation with natural gas fueled generation  largely address the cair requirements for nox for our north carolina units at pec 
pec and pef met the phase i requirements for nox and the phase i requirements of cair for nox and so with a combination of emission reductions resulting from in service emission control equipment and emission allowances 
pef s crystal river unit no 
cr so and nox emission control equipment was placed in service in may and pef s crystal river unit no 
cr so and nox emission control equipment was placed in service in in  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit dc court of appeals initially vacated the cair in its entirety and subsequently remanded the rule without vacating it for the epa to conduct further proceedings consistent with the court s prior opinion 
on august   the epa published the proposed transport rule  which is the regulatory program that will replace the cair when finalized 
the proposed transport rule contains new emissions trading programs for nox and so emissions as well as more stringent overall emissions targets 
the epa plans to finalize the transport rule in the spring of due to significant investments in nox and so emissions controls and fleet modernization projects completed or under way  we believe both pec and pef are well positioned to comply with the transport rule 
the outcome of the epa s rulemaking cannot be predicted 
because of the dc court of appeals decision that remanded the cair  the current implementation of the cair continues to fulfill bart for nox and so for bart affected units under the cavr 
should this determination change as the transport rule is promulgated  cavr compliance eventually may require consideration of nox and so emissions reductions in addition to particulate matter emissions reductions for bart eligible units 
under an agreement with the florida department of environmental protection fdep  pef will retire crystal river units no 
and no 
coal fired steam units cr and cr and operate emission control equipment at cr and cr cr and cr will be retired after the second proposed nuclear unit at levy completes its first fuel cycle  which was originally anticipated to be around as required  pef has advised the fdep of developments that will delay the retirement of cr and cr beyond the originally anticipated date as discussed in other matters nuclear potential new construction 
we are currently evaluating the impacts of the levy schedule on pef s compliance with environmental regulations 
we cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
clean air mercury rule in  the dc court of appeals vacated the camr 
as a result  the epa subsequently announced that it will develop a maximum achievable control technology mact standard 
the united states district court for the district of columbia has issued an order requiring the epa to issue a final mact standard for power plants by november  in addition  north carolina adopted a state specific requirement 
the north carolina mercury rule contains a requirement that all coal fired units in the state install mercury controls by december   and requires compliance plan applications to be submitted in we are currently evaluating the impact of these decisions 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
clean air visibility rule the epa s rule requires states to identify facilities  including power plants  built between august and august with the potential to produce emissions that affect visibility in certain specially protected areas  including national parks and wilderness areas  designated as class i areas 
to help restore visibility in those areas  states must require the identified facilities to install bart to control their emissions 
pec s bart eligible units are asheville units no 
and no 
 roxboro units no 
 no 
and no 
 and sutton unit no 
pef s bart eligible units are anclote units no 
and no 
 cr and cr the reductions associated with bart begin in as discussed in note b  sutton unit no 
is one of the coal fired generating units that pec plans to replace with combined cycle natural gas fueled electric generation 
as discussed previously  pef and the fdep announced an agreement under which pef will retire cr and cr as coal fired units 
the cavr included the epa s determination that compliance with the nox and so requirements of the cair could be used by states as a bart substitute to fulfill bart obligations  but the states could require the installation of additional air quality controls if they did not achieve reasonable progress in improving visibility 
the dc court of appeals decision remanding the cair maintained its implementation such that cair satisfies bart for nox and so should this determination change as the transport rule is promulgated  cavr compliance eventually may require consideration of nox and so emissions in addition to particulate matter emissions for bart eligible units 
we are assessing the potential impact of bart and its implications with respect to our plans and estimated costs to comply with the cavr 
the fdep finalized a regional haze implementation rule that goes beyond bart by requiring sources significantly impacting visibility in class i areas to install additional controls by december  however  in the spring of the epa indicated that the reasonable further progress portion of the regional haze implementation rule is not approvable 
in august  the fdep amended the rule by removing the reasonable further progress provision  including the december   deadline for installation of additional controls  and instead will rely on current federal programs to achieve improvement in visibility 
the outcome of these matters cannot be predicted 
compliance strategy both pec and pef have been developing an integrated compliance strategy to meet the requirements of the cair  the cavr  mercury regulation and related air quality regulations 
the air quality controls installed to comply with nox requirements under certain sections of the caa and the clean smokestacks act  as well as pec s plan to replace a portion of its coal fired generation with natural gas fueled generation  resulted in a reduction of the costs to meet pec s cair requirements 
pec s environmental compliance projects under the first phase of clean smokestacks act emission reductions have been placed in service 
pef s environmental compliance projects have also been placed in service 
the fpsc approved pef s petition to develop and implement an integrated clean air compliance plan to comply with the cair  camr and cavr and for recovery of prudently incurred costs necessary to achieve this strategy through the ecrc see discussion previously regarding the vacating of the camr and remanding of the cair and its potential impact on cavr 
pef s april  filing with the fpsc for true up of final environmental costs included a review of the integrated clean air compliance plan  which reconfirmed the efficacy of the recommended plan and included an estimated total project cost of approximately billion to be spent through  to plan  design  build and install pollution control equipment at the anclote plant  cr and cr the majority of the billion estimated total project cost related to cr and cr projects  which have been placed in service 
additional costs may be incurred if pollution controls are required in order to comply with the requirements of the cavr  as discussed previously  or to meet compliance requirements of the final transport rule 
subsequent rule interpretations  increases in the underlying material  labor and equipment costs  equipment availability  or the unexpected acceleration of compliance dates  among other things  could result in significant increases in our estimated costs to comply and acceleration of some projects 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
environmental compliance cost estimates risk factors regarding environmental compliance cost estimates are discussed in item a  risk factors 
costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations are eligible for regulatory recovery through either base rates or cost recovery clauses 
the outcome of future petitions for recovery cannot be predicted 
our estimates of capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations are subject to periodic review and revision and may vary significantly 
pec is continuing to evaluate various design  technology and new generation options that could change expenditures required to maintain compliance with the clean smokestacks act limits subsequent to additional compliance plans for pec and pef to meet the requirements of the transport rule will be determined upon finalization of the rule 
as a result of the decision remanding the cair  compliance plans and costs to meet the requirements of the cavr are being reassessed and we cannot predict the impact that the epa s further proceedings will have on our compliance with the cavr requirements 
compliance plans to meet the requirements of a revised or new implementing rule for mercury will be determined upon finalization of the rule 
compliance plans to meet the requirements of a revised or new implementing rule under section b of the clean water act section b  as discussed below  will be determined upon finalization of the rule 
the timing and extent of the costs for future projects will depend upon final compliance strategies 
however  we believe that future costs to comply with new or subsequent rule interpretations could be significant 
north carolina attorney general petition under section of the clean air act in  the north carolina attorney general filed a petition with the epa  under section of the caa  asking the federal government to force fossil fuel fired power plants in other states  including south carolina  to reduce their nox and so emissions 
the state of north carolina contends these out of state emissions interfere with north carolina s ability to meet national ambient air quality standards naaqs for ozone and particulate matter 
in  the epa issued a final response denying the petition  and the north carolina attorney general filed a petition in the dc court of appeals seeking a review of the agency s denial 
in  the dc court of appeals remanded the epa s denial to the agency for reconsideration 
the outcome of the remand proceeding cannot be predicted 
national ambient air quality standards environmental groups and states filed a joint petition with the dc court of appeals arguing that the epa particulate matter rule does not adequately restrict levels of particulate matter  especially with respect to the annual and secondary standards 
in  the dc court of appeals remanded the annual and secondary standards to the epa for further review and consideration 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
in  the epa revised the hour primary and secondary standards for the naaqs for ground level ozone 
additional nonattainment areas may be designated in pec s and pef s service territories as a result of these revised standards 
a number of states  environmental groups and industry associations filed petitions against the revised naaqs in the dc court of appeals 
the epa requested the dc court of appeals to suspend proceedings in the case while the epa evaluates whether to maintain  modify or otherwise reconsider the revised naaqs 
in  the epa announced that it was reconsidering the level of the ozone naaqs and it will stay plans to designate nonattainment areas until after the reconsideration has been completed 
on january   the epa announced a proposed revision to the primary ozone naaqs 
in addition  the epa proposed a cumulative seasonal secondary standard 
the epa plans to finalize the revisions by july   and to designate nonattainment areas by august the proposed revisions are significantly more stringent than the current naaqs 
should additional nonattainment areas be designated in our service territories  we may be required to install additional emission controls at some of our facilities 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
on january   the epa announced a revision to the primary naaqs for nitrogen dioxide 
historically  the standard for nitrogen dioxide has been an annual average 
the epa has retained the annual standard and added a new hour naaqs 
in conjunction with proposing changes to the standard  the epa is also requiring an increase in the coverage of the monitoring network  particularly near roadways where the highest concentrations are expected to occur due to traffic emissions 
the epa plans to designate nonattainment areas by january currently  there are no monitors reporting violation of the new standard in pec s or pef s service territories  but the expanded monitoring network will provide additional data  which could result in additional nonattainment areas 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
on june   the epa published the final new hour naaqs for so  which sets the limit at parts per billion 
the primary naaqs on a hour average basis and annual average will be eliminated under the new rule 
the new hour standard is a significant increase in the stringency of the standard and increases the risk of nonattainment  especially near uncontrolled coal fired facilities 
in addition  for the first time the epa plans to use air quality modeling along with monitoring data in determining whether areas are attaining the new standard  which is likely to expand the number of nonattainment areas 
should additional nonattainment areas be designated in our service territories  we may be required to install additional emission controls at some of our facilities 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
water quality general as a result of the operation of certain pollution control equipment required to comply with the air quality issues outlined previously  new sources of wastewater discharge will be generated at certain affected facilities 
integration of these new wastewater discharges into the existing wastewater treatment processes is currently ongoing and will result in permitting  construction and treatment requirements imposed on the utilities now and into the future 
the future costs of complying with these requirements could be material to our or the utilities results of operations or financial position 
on september   the epa concluded after a multi year study of power plant wastewater discharges that current regulations have not kept pace with changes in the electric power industry since the regulations were issued in  including addressing impacts to wastewater discharge from operation of air pollution control equipment 
as a result  the epa has announced that it plans to revise the regulations that govern wastewater discharge  which may result in operational changes and additional compliance costs in the future 
the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
section b of the clean water act section b requires cooling water intake structures to reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental impacts 
the epa promulgated a rule implementing section b in respect to existing power plants in july a number of states  environmental groups and others sought judicial review of the july rule 
in  the us court of appeals for the second circuit issued an opinion and order remanding provisions of the rule to the epa  and the epa suspended the rule pending further rulemaking  with the exception of the requirement that permitted facilities must meet any requirements under section b as determined by the permitting authorities on a case by case  best professional judgment basis 
following appeal  in  the us supreme court issued an opinion holding that the epa  in selecting the best technology pursuant to section b  does have the authority to reject technology when its costs are wholly disproportionate to the benefits expected 
also  the us supreme court held that epa s site specific variance procedure contained in the july rule was permissible in that the procedure required testing to determine whether costs would be significantly greater than the benefits before a variance would be considered 
as a result of these developments  our plans and associated estimated costs to comply with section b will need to be reassessed and determined in accordance with any revised or new implementing rule after it is established by the epa 
costs of compliance with a revised or new implementing rule are expected to be higher  and could be significantly higher  than estimated costs under the july rule 
our cost estimates to comply with the july rule were million to million  including million to million at pec and million to million at pef 
in december  consent decrees were entered in two pending federal actions brought by environmental groups against the epa requiring the epa to issue proposed b rules by march   and to issue a final decision by july  the outcome of this matter cannot be predicted 
other environmental matters climate change growing state  federal and international attention to global climate change may result in the regulation of co and other ghgs 
in addition  the obama administration has begun the process of regulating ghg emissions through use of the caa 
in  the us supreme court ruled that the epa has the authority under the caa to regulate co emissions from new automobiles 
in  the epa announced that six ghgs co  methane  nitrous oxide  hydrofluorocarbons  perfluorocarbons and sulfur hexafluoride pose a threat to public health and welfare under the caa 
a number of parties have filed petitions for review of this finding in the dc court of appeals 
on december   the epa announced a schedule for development of a new source performance standard for new and existing fossil fuel fired electric utility units 
under the schedule  the epa will propose the standard by july and issue the final rule by may the full impact of regulation under ghg initiatives and any final legislation  if enacted  cannot be determined at this time  however  we anticipate that it could result in significant cost increases over time for which the utilities would seek corresponding rate recovery 
we are preparing for a carbon constrained future and are actively engaged in helping shape effective policies to address the issue 
the state of florida s comprehensive energy legislation included a directive that the fdep develop rules to establish a cap and trade program to regulate ghg emissions that would be presented to the legislature 
the fdep has studied ghg policy options and the potential economic impacts  but it has not developed a regulation for the consideration of the legislature 
while state level study groups have been active in all three of our jurisdictions  we continue to believe that this issue requires a national policy framework one that provides certainty and consistency 
our balanced solution as discussed in other matters energy demand is a comprehensive plan to meet the anticipated demand in the utilities service territories and provides a solid basis for slowing and reducing co emissions by focusing on energy efficiency  alternative energy and a state of the art power system 
there are ongoing efforts to reach a new international climate change treaty to succeed the kyoto protocol 
the kyoto protocol was originally adopted by the united nations to address global climate change by reducing emissions of co and other ghgs 
although the treaty went into effect in  the united states has not adopted it 
in  the united nations framework convention on climate change convened the th conference of the parties to conduct further negotiations on ghg emissions reductions 
at the conclusion of the conference  a number of the parties  including the united states  entered into a nonbinding accord calling upon the parties to submit emission reduction targets for to the united nations framework convention on climate change secretariat by the end of january on january   president obama submitted a proposal to reduce the us ghg emissions in the range of percent below levels by  subject to future congressional action 
reductions in co emissions to the levels specified by the kyoto protocol  potential new international treaties or federal or state proposals could be materially adverse to our financial position or results of operations if associated costs of control or limitation cannot be recovered from ratepayers 
the cost impact of legislation or regulation to address global climate change would depend on the specific legislation or regulation enacted and cannot be determined at this time 
in  the epa issued the final ghg emissions reporting rule  which establishes a national protocol for the reporting of annual ghg emissions 
facilities that emit greater than  metric tons per year of ghgs must report emissions by march of each year beginning in for year emissions 
because the rule builds on current emission reporting requirements  compliance with the requirements is not expected to have a material impact on the utilities 
on april   the epa and the national highway transportation safety administration jointly announced the first regulation of ghg emissions from new vehicles 
the epa is regulating mobile source ghg emissions under section of the caa  which according to the epa also results in stationary sources  such as coal fired power plants  being subject to regulation of ghg emissions under the caa 
on march   the epa issued an interpretation that stationary source ghg emissions will be subject to regulation under the caa beginning in january on may   the epa issued the final tailoring rule  which establishes the thresholds for applicability of the prevention of significant deterioration program permitting requirements for ghg emissions from stationary sources such as power plants and manufacturing facilities 
prevention of significant deterioration is a construction air pollution permitting program designed to ensure air quality does not degrade beyond the naaqs levels or beyond specified incremental amounts above a prescribed baseline level 
the tailoring rule initially raises the permitting applicability threshold for ghg emissions to  tons per year  and it requires that the permitting requirements for ghg emissions from stationary sources begin on january  these developments require pec and pef to address ghg emissions in new air quality permits beginning in the impact of these developments cannot be predicted 
synthetic fuels tax credits historically  we had substantial operations associated with the production of coal based solid synthetic fuels as defined under section of the internal revenue code the code section and as redesignated effective as section k of the code section k as discussed below 
the production and sale of these products qualified for federal income tax credits so long as certain requirements were satisfied 
qualifying synthetic fuels facilities entitled their owners to federal income tax credits based on the barrel of oil equivalent of the synthetic fuels produced and sold by these plants 
the synthetic fuels tax credit program expired at the end of  and the synthetic fuels businesses were abandoned and reclassified to discontinued operations 
the amount of section tax credits that we were allowed to claim in any calendar year through december   was limited by the amount of our regular federal income tax liability 
section tax credit amounts allowed but not utilized are carried forward indefinitely as deferred alternative minimum tax credits 
legislation enacted in redesignated section tax credits generated after january   as general business credits under section k of the code 
the redesignation of section tax credits generated after january   as a section k general business credit removed the regular federal income tax liability limit on synthetic fuels production and subjects the credits to a one year carry back period and a year carry forward period 
total section k credits generated under the synthetic fuels tax credit program including those generated by florida progress prior to our acquisition were billion  billion of which has been used through december   to offset regular federal income tax liability and million is being carried forward as deferred tax credits that do not expire

liquidity and capital resources overview pec has primarily used a combination of debt securities  commercial paper and its revolving credit agreement for liquidity needs in excess of cash provided by operations 
pec also participates in the utility money pool  which allows pec and pef to lend and borrow to and from each other 
see discussion of credit ratings in progress energy credit rating matters 
pec expects to have sufficient resources to meet its future obligations through a combination of cash from operations  availability under its credit facility  money pool borrowings  issuances of commercial paper and long term debt and or contributions of equity from the parent 
cash flow discussion historical for as compared to and as compared to cash flows from operations net cash provided by operating activities increased million for  when compared to the increase was primarily due to the million favorable impact of weather partially offset by million higher nuclear plant outage and maintenance costs included in o m  both as previously discussed  million lower cash used for inventory  primarily due to higher coal consumption as a result of favorable weather in that was fulfilled through the usage of inventory from year end  million lower cash used for pension and other benefits primarily due to a reduction of contributions made in  and million lower cash paid for income taxes 
these amounts were partially offset by a million decrease in the over recovery of fuel as a result of higher fuel costs in net cash provided by operating activities increased million in  when compared to the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a million over recovery of fuel in compared to a million under recovery of fuel in due to higher fuel rates in  million in lower net income tax payments and a million decrease in inventory purchases primarily driven by lower coal prices in these impacts were partially offset by million of pension and other benefits contributions made in investing activities net cash used by investing activities increased million in  when compared with the increase was primarily due to a million increase in gross property additions and a million increase in nuclear fuel additions  partially offset by a million decrease in advances to affiliated companies 
the increase in property additions is primarily due to increased capital expenditures at the wayne county  new hanover county and harris generating facilities 
the increase in nuclear fuel additions was primarily due to the three nuclear refueling and maintenance outages in  compared to two in net cash used by investing activities increased million in  when compared with the increase was primarily due to a million increase in advances to affiliated companies and a million increase in gross property additions  partially offset by a million decrease in nuclear fuel additions 
property additions are primarily for normal construction activity and ongoing capital expenditures related to environmental compliance programs 
financing activities net cash used by financing activities decreased million for when compared to the decrease in net cash used by financing activities was primarily due to the million payment at maturity of long term debt in  the million net repayment of commercial paper in and a million reduction in dividends paid to the parent in compared to these impacts were partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  net in net cash used by financing activities increased million for when compared to the increase in net cash used by financing activities was primarily due to the million in dividends paid to the parent in  the million net repayment of commercial paper in  the million issuance of commercial paper in  and the million increase in the payment at maturity of long term debt in compared to these impacts were partially offset by a million increase in the proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  net in compared to  as well as the million repayment of advances from affiliates in on october   pec entered into a new million  three year rca with a syndication of financial institutions 
the rca is used to provide liquidity support for pec s issuances of commercial paper and other short term obligations  and for general corporate purposes 
the rca will expire on october  the million rca was terminated effective october  see credit facilities and registration statements 
on january   pec issued million of first mortgage bonds  series due a portion of the proceeds was used to repay the maturity of pec s million senior notes  due march  the remaining proceeds were used to repay pec s outstanding short term debt and for general corporate purposes 
on june   pec entered into a seventy seventh supplemental indenture to its mortgage and deed of trust  dated may   as supplemented  in connection with certain amendments to the mortgage 
the amendments are set forth in the seventy seventh supplemental indenture and include an amendment to extend the maturity date of the mortgage by years

short term debt at december   pec had no outstanding short term debt 
at the end of each month during  pec had a maximum short term debt balance of million and an average short term debt balance of million at a weighted average interest rate of percent 
pec s short term debt during consisted solely of money pool borrowings 
future liquidity and capital resources pec s estimated capital requirements for  and are approximately billion  billion and billion  respectively  and primarily reflect construction expenditures to support customer growth  add regulated generation and upgrade existing facilities as discussed in progress energy capital expenditures 
pec expects to fund its capital requirements primarily through a combination of cash from operations  issuance of long term debt and or contributions of equity from the parent 
in addition  pec has a million credit facility that supports the issuance of commercial paper 
access to the commercial paper market and the utility money pool provide additional liquidity to help meet pec s working capital requirements 
over the long term  meeting the anticipated load growth will require a balanced approach  including energy conservation and efficiency programs  development and deployment of new energy technologies  and new generation  transmission and distribution facilities  including new generating facilities in the carolinas currently under construction and the potential for additional new baseload generating facilities toward the middle of the next decade 
this approach will require pec to make significant capital investments 
see progress energy introduction strategy for additional information 
pec may pursue joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties in order to share some of the financing and operational risks associated with new baseload generation 
pec has on file with the sec a shelf registration statement under which it may issue an unlimited number or amount of various long term debt securities and preferred stock

pef the information required by this item is incorporated herein by reference to the following portions of progress energy s md a insofar as they relate to pef results of operations  application of critical accounting policies and estimates  liquidity and capital resources and other matters 
the following md a and the information incorporated herein by reference contain forward looking statements that involve estimates  projections  goals  forecasts  assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
please review safe harbor for forward looking statements and item a  risk factors  for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
liquidity and capital resources overview pef has primarily used a combination of debt securities  equity contributions from the parent  commercial paper and its revolving credit agreement for liquidity needs in excess of cash provided by operations 
pef also participates in the utility money pool  which allows pec and pef to lend and borrow to and from each other 
see discussion of credit ratings in progress energy credit rating matters 
pef expects to have sufficient resources to meet its future obligations through a combination of cash from operations  availability under its credit facility  money pool borrowings  issuances of commercial paper and long term debt and or contributions of equity from the parent 
cash flow discussion historical for as compared to and as compared to cash flows from operations net cash provided by operating activities increased million for  when compared to the increase was primarily due to the million favorable impact of weather as previously discussed  million net cash receipts from income taxes in compared to million of net cash payments for income taxes in  and million lower cash used for inventory  primarily due to higher coal consumption in as a result of favorable weather that was fulfilled through usage of inventory from year end these amounts were partially offset by an million under recovery of fuel in compared to a million over recovery of fuel in driven by lower fuel rates in and million of net payments of cash collateral to counterparties on derivative contracts in compared to million net refunds of cash collateral in net cash provided by operating activities increased billion in  when compared with the increase in operating cash flow was primarily due to a million over recovery of fuel in compared to a million under recovery of fuel in due to higher fuel rates in  a million payment made in to counterparties for collateral associated with derivative contracts and million net refunds of cash collateral in the change in derivative collateral assets was primarily driven by the relative fair values of our commodity derivative instruments see note a 
investing activities net cash used by investing activities decreased million in  when compared with the decrease in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to a million decrease in gross property additions and a million increase in cash provided by other investing activities 
the decrease in property additions was driven by decreases in environmental compliance spending and expenditures for nuclear projects 
the increase in cash provided by other investing activities is driven by the receipt of million of neil insurance proceeds for repairs due to the cr extended outage 
net cash used by investing activities increased million in  when compared with the increase in cash used by investing activities was primarily due to a million decrease in settlements of advances to affiliates and a million increase in nuclear fuel additions  partially offset by a million decrease in gross property additions 
the decrease in property additions was driven by decreases in environmental compliance spending and completion of the bartow plant repowering project  partially offset by an increase in expenditures for nuclear projects 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities decreased million for when compared to the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to a million contribution from the parent in  a million decrease in advances from affiliates and a million retirement at maturity of long term debt in the decreases are partially offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of long term debt in and million repayment of commercial paper in net cash provided by financing activities decreased million for when compared to the decrease in cash provided by financing activities was primarily due to pef s billion in net proceeds from issuance of long term debt in  outstanding commercial paper issuances of million in  and repayment of commercial paper outstanding of million in  partially offset by receipts of million in contributions from the parent in and million of long term debt retirements in on march   pef issued million of first mortgage bonds due and million of first mortgage bonds due proceeds were used to repay the outstanding balance of pef s notes payable to affiliated companies  to repay the maturity of pef s million first mortgage bonds due june   and for general corporate purposes 
on october   pef entered into a new million  three year rca with a syndication of financial institutions 
the rca is used to provide liquidity support for pef s issuances of commercial paper and other short term obligations  and for general corporate purposes 
the rca will expire on october  the million rca was terminated effective october  see credit facilities and registration statements 
in  pef did not issue or retire long term debt 
on february   pef paid at maturity million of its first mortgage bonds with available cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings 
on march   pef amended its rca with a syndication of financial institutions to extend the termination date by one year to march  this rca was terminated on october  see credit facilities and registration statements 
on june   pef issued million of first mortgage bonds  series due and billion of first mortgage bonds  series due a portion of the proceeds was used to repay pef s utility money pool borrowings and the remaining proceeds were placed in temporary investments for general corporate use as needed 
on august   pef redeemed the entire outstanding million principal amount of its series a floating rate notes due november   at percent of par plus accrued interest 
the redemption was funded with a portion of the proceeds from the june  debt issuance 
on november   pef  the parent  as a well known seasoned issuer  and pec filed a combined shelf registration statement with the sec  which became effective upon filing with the sec 
the registration statement is effective for three years and does not limit the amount or number of various securities that can be issued see credit facilities and registration statements 
short term debt at december   pef had outstanding short term debt consisting of money pool borrowings totaling million at an interest rate of percent 
at the end of each month during  pef had a maximum short term debt balance of million and an average short term debt balance of million at a weighted average interest rate of percent 
pef s short term debt during consisted solely of money pool borrowings 
future liquidity and capital resources pef s estimated capital requirements for  and are approximately million to million  million to million  and billion to billion  respectively  and primarily reflect construction expenditures to support customer growth  add regulated generation and upgrade existing facilities as discussed in progress energy capital expenditures 
pef s estimated capital requirements include potential nuclear construction expenditures for levy 
forecasted potential nuclear construction expenditures are dependent upon  and may vary significantly based upon  the decision to build  regulatory approval schedules  timing and escalation of project costs  and the percentages of joint ownership 
because of announced schedule shifts  we negotiated an amendment to the levy epc agreement see discussion under other matters nuclear potential new construction 
the forecasted capital expenditures reflect the announced schedule shift 
additionally  in light of the schedule shifts in the levy nuclear project  pef may incur fees and charges related to the disposition of outstanding purchase orders on long lead time equipment  which could be material 
in june  pef completed its long lead time equipment disposition analysis to minimize the impact associated with the schedule shift 
as a result of the analysis  pef will continue with selected components of the long lead time equipment 
work has been suspended on the remaining long lead time equipment items and pef has been in suspension negotiations with the selected equipment vendors  which pef anticipates concluding by the end of the first quarter of potential nuclear construction expenditures are subject to cost recovery provisions 
pef expects to fund its capital requirements primarily through a combination of cash from operations  issuance of long term debt and or contributions of equity from the parent 
in addition  pef has a million credit facility that supports the issuance of commercial paper 
access to the commercial paper market and the utility money pool provide additional liquidity to help meet pef s working capital requirements 
at december   the current portion of pef s long term debt was million  which we expect to fund with a combination of cash from operations  commercial paper borrowings and or long term debt 
over the long term  meeting the anticipated load growth will require a balanced approach  including energy conservation and efficiency programs  development and deployment of new energy technologies  and new generation  transmission and distribution facilities  potentially including new baseload generating facilities in florida toward the middle of the next decade 
this approach will require pef to make significant capital investments 
pef may pursue joint ventures or similar arrangements with third parties in order to share some of the financing and operational risks associated with new baseload generation 
pef has on file with the sec a shelf registration statement under which it may issue an unlimited number or amount of various long term debt securities and preferred stock 
the shelf registration statement expires on november  see credit facilities and registration statements 
capitalization ratios the following table shows each component of capitalization as a percentage of total capitalization at december  and in addition to total common stock equity and preferred stock  total capitalization includes the following in total debt long term debt  net  current portion of long term debt  notes payable to affiliate companies and capital lease obligations

off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations see discussion under progress energy and notes a  b and c for information on pef s off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations at december  market risk and derivatives under its risk management policy  pef may use a variety of instruments  including swaps  options and forward contracts  to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
see note and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of market risk and derivatives 
contractual obligations this information called for by item is omitted for pef pursuant to instruction i a to form k omission of information by certain wholly owned subsidiaries 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks related to changes in market conditions 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we have a risk management committee that includes senior executives from various business groups 
the risk management committee is responsible for administering risk management policies and monitoring compliance with those policies by all subsidiaries 
under our risk policy  we may use a variety of instruments  including swaps  options and forward contracts  to manage exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices and interest rates 
such instruments contain credit risk to the extent that the counterparty fails to perform under the contract 
we minimize such risk by performing credit and financial reviews using a combination of financial analysis and publicly available credit ratings of such counterparties see note 
both pec and pef also have limited counterparty exposure for commodity hedges primarily gas and oil hedges by spreading concentration risk over a number of counterparties 
the following disclosures about market risk contain forward looking statements that involve estimates  projections  goals  forecasts  assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
please review item a  risk factors  and safe harbor for forward looking statements for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward looking statements made herein 
certain market risks are inherent in our financial instruments  which arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
our primary exposures are changes in interest rates with respect to our long term debt and commercial paper  fluctuations in the return on marketable securities with respect to our ndt funds  changes in the market value of cvos and changes in energy related commodity prices 
these financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
the risks discussed below do not include the price risks associated with nonfinancial instrument transactions and positions associated with our operations  such as purchase and sales commitments and inventory 
progress energy interest rate risk as part of our debt portfolio management and daily cash management  we have variable rate long term debt and may have commercial paper and or loans outstanding under our rca facilities  which are also exposed to floating interest rates 
approximately percent and percent of consolidated debt had variable rates at december  and  respectively 
based on our variable rate long term debt balances at december   a basis point change in interest rates would result in an annual pre tax interest expense change of approximately million 
we had no outstanding short term debt at december  from time to time  we use interest rate derivative instruments to adjust the mix between fixed and floating rate debt in our debt portfolio  to mitigate our exposure to interest rate fluctuations associated with certain debt instruments and to hedge interest rates with regard to future fixed rate debt issuances 
the notional amounts of interest rate derivatives are not exchanged and do not represent exposure to credit loss 
in the event of default by a counterparty  the exposure in the transaction is the cost of replacing the agreements at current market rates 
we use a number of models and methods to determine interest rate risk exposure and fair value of derivative positions 
for reporting purposes  fair values and exposures of derivative positions are determined as of the end of the reporting period using the bloomberg financial markets system 
in accordance with gaap  interest rate derivatives that qualify as hedges are separated into one of two categories cash flow hedges or fair value hedges 
cash flow hedges are used to reduce exposure to changes in cash flow due to fluctuating interest rates 
fair value hedges are used to reduce exposure to changes in fair value due to interest rate changes 
the following tables provide information  at december  and  about our interest rate risk sensitive instruments 
the tables present principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the fixed and variable rate long term debt and parent obligated mandatorily redeemable preferred securities of trust 
the tables also include estimates of the fair value of our interest rate risk sensitive instruments based on quoted market prices for these or similar issues 
for interest rate forward contracts  the tables present notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual mandatory termination dates for to and thereafter and the related fair value 
notional amounts are used to calculate the settlement amounts under the interest rate forward contracts

marketable securities price risk the utilities maintain trust funds  pursuant to nrc requirements  to fund certain costs of decommissioning their nuclear plants 
these funds are primarily invested in stocks  bonds and cash equivalents  which are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and to changes in interest rates 
at december  and december   the fair value of these funds was billion and billion  respectively  including billion and million  respectively  for pec and million and million  respectively  for pef 
we actively monitor our portfolio by benchmarking the performance of our investments against certain indices and by maintaining  and periodically reviewing  target allocation percentages for various asset classes 
the accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that the utilities regulated electric rates provide for recovery of these costs net of any trust fund earnings  and  therefore  fluctuations in trust fund marketable security returns do not affect earnings 
see note for further information on the trust fund securities 
contingent value obligations market value risk cvos are recorded at fair value  and unrealized gains and losses from changes in fair value are recognized in earnings 
at december  and december   the fair value of cvos was million 
we perform sensitivity analyses to estimate our exposure to the market risk of the cvos 
the sensitivity analyses performed on the cvos uses quoted prices obtained from brokers or quote services to measure the potential loss in earnings from a hypothetical percent adverse change in market prices over the next months 
a hypothetical percent increase in the december  market price would result in a million increase in the fair value of the cvos and a corresponding increase in the cvo liability 
commodity price risk we are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas  coal  fuel oil  electricity and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of our ownership of energy related assets 
our exposure to these fluctuations is significantly limited by the cost based regulation of the utilities 
each state commission allows electric utilities to recover certain of these costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines that such costs are prudent 
therefore  while there may be a delay in the timing between when these costs are incurred and when these costs are recovered from the ratepayers  changes from year to year have no material impact on operating results 
in addition  most of our long term power sales contracts shift substantially all fuel price risk to the purchaser 
most of our physical commodity contracts are not derivatives or qualify as normal purchases or sales 
therefore  such contracts are not recorded at fair value 
at december   substantially all derivative commodity instrument positions were subject to retail regulatory treatment
