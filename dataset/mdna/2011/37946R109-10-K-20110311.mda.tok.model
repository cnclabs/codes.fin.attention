item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of global partners lp should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements of global partners lp and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview general we own  control or have access to one of the largest terminal networks of refined petroleum products in the northeast 
we are one of the largest wholesale distributors of gasoline  distillates such as home heating oil  diesel and kerosene  residual oil and renewable fuels such as ethanol to wholesalers  retailers and commercial customers in the new england states and new york 
we own and supply fuel to mobil branded retail gas stations leased properties and fee properties in new england and supply mobil branded fuel to an additional independently owned stations 
in  we sold approximately billion of refined petroleum products and small amounts of natural gas and renewable fuels 
in addition  we had revenues of approximately million  primarily from convenience store sales at our directly operated stores and gas station rental income 
we purchase our refined petroleum products primarily from domestic and foreign refiners  major and independent oil companies and trading companies and sell these products in two segments  wholesale and commercial 
like most independent marketers of refined petroleum products  we base our pricing on spot physical prices and routinely use the nymex or other derivatives to hedge our commodity risk inherent in buying and selling energy commodities 
through the use of regulated exchanges or derivatives  we maintain a position that is substantially balanced between purchased volumes and sales volumes or future delivery obligations 
we earn a margin by selling the product for physical delivery to third parties 
products and operational structure our products primarily include unbranded and mobil branded gasoline  distillates and residual oil 
we sell gasoline to unbranded and mobil branded retail gasoline stations and other resellers of transportation fuels 
the distillates we sell are used primarily for fuel for trucks and off road construction equipment and for space heating of residential and commercial buildings 
we sell residual oil to major housing units  such as public housing authorities  colleges and hospitals and large industrial facilities that use processed steam in their manufacturing processes 
in addition  we sell bunker fuel  which we can custom blend  to cruise ships  bulk carriers and fishing fleets 
we have increased our sales in the non weather sensitive components of our business  such as transportation fuels  however  we are still subject to the impact that warmer weather conditions may have on our home heating oil and residual oil sales 
our business is divided into three operating segments wholesale 
this segment includes sales of unbranded and mobil branded gasoline  distillates  residual oil and small amounts of renewable fuels to retail gasoline stations and other resellers of transportation fuels  home heating oil retailers and wholesale distributors 
commercial 
this segment includes sales and deliveries of unbranded gasoline  distillates  residual oil and small amounts of natural gas and renewable fuels to end user customers in the public sector and to large commercial and industrial end user customers 
in the case of commercial and industrial end user customers  we sell our products primarily either through a competitive bidding process or through contracts of various terms 
our commercial segment sales also include sales of mobil branded gasoline to end users at our directly operated gas 
table of contents stations 
this segment also purchases  custom blends  sells and delivers bunker fuel and diesel to cruise ships  bulk carriers and fishing fleets generally by barges 
other 
this segment includes convenience store  car wash and other ancillary sales and rental income from the dealer leased sites defined below 
please read exxonmobil acquisition 
our business is substantially comprised of purchasing  storing  terminalling and selling refined petroleum products 
in a contango market when product prices for future deliveries are higher than for current deliveries  we may use our storage capacity to improve our margins by storing products we have purchased at lower prices in the current market for delivery to customers at higher prices in the future 
in a backward market when product prices for future deliveries are lower than current deliveries  we attempt to minimize our inventories to reduce commodity risk and maintain or increase net product margins 
see part i  item a  risk factors  for additional information related to commodity risk 
outlook this section identifies certain risks and certain economic or industry wide factors that may affect our financial performance and results of operations in the future  both in the short term and in the long term 
our results of operations and financial condition depend  in part  upon the following the condition of credit markets may adversely affect our liquidity 
in the recent past  world financial markets experienced a severe reduction in the availability of credit 
although we were not negatively impacted by this condition  possible negative impacts in the future could include a decrease in the availability of borrowings under our credit agreement  increased counterparty credit risk on our derivatives contracts and our contractual counterparties requiring us to provide collateral 
in addition  we could experience a tightening of trade credit from our suppliers 
we commit substantial resources to pursuing acquisitions  though there is no certainty that we will successfully complete any acquisitions or receive the economic results we anticipate from completed acquisitions 
consistent with our business strategy  we are continuously engaged in discussions with potential sellers of terminalling  storage and or marketing assets and related businesses 
our growth largely depends on our ability to make accretive acquisitions 
we may be unable to make such accretive acquisitions for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to  the following we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts  we are unable to raise financing for such acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  or we are outbid by competitors 
in addition  we may consummate acquisitions that at the time of consummation we believe will be accretive  but that ultimately may not be accretive 
if any of these events were to occur  our future growth would be limited 
we can give no assurance that our acquisition efforts will be successful or that any such acquisition will be completed on terms that are favorable to us 
our financial results are generally better in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year 
demand for some refined petroleum products  specifically home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes  is generally higher during november through march than during april through october 
we obtain a significant portion of these sales during these winter months 
therefore  our results of operations for the first and fourth calendar quarters are generally better than for the second and third quarters 
with lower cash flow during the second and third calendar quarters  we may be required to borrow money in order to maintain current levels of distributions to our unitholders 
warmer weather conditions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
weather conditions generally have an impact on the demand for both home heating oil and 
table of contents residual oil 
because we supply distributors whose customers depend on home heating oil and residual oil for space heating purposes during the winter  warmer than normal temperatures during the first and fourth calendar quarters in the northeast can decrease the total volume we sell and the gross profit realized on those sales 
energy efficiency  new technology and alternative fuels could reduce demand for our products 
increased conservation and technological advances have adversely affected the demand for home heating oil and residual oil 
consumption of residual oil has steadily declined over the last three decades 
we could face additional competition from alternative energy sources as a result of future government mandated controls or regulation further promoting the use of cleaner fuels 
end users who are dual fuel users have the ability to switch between residual oil and natural gas 
other end users may elect to convert to natural gas 
during a period of increasing residual oil prices relative to the prices of natural gas  dual fuel customers may switch and other end users may convert to natural gas 
residential users of home heating oil may also convert to natural gas 
such switching or conversion could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
in addition  new technologies and alternative fuel sources  such as electric  hybrid or battery powered motor vehicles  could reduce the demand for gasoline and adversely impact our gasoline sales 
a reduction in gasoline sales could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
our financial condition and results of operations are influenced by the overall forward market for refined petroleum products  and increases and or decreases in the prices of refined petroleum products may adversely impact the amount of borrowing available for working capital under our credit agreement  which credit agreement has borrowing base limitations and advance rates  as well as access to trade credit 
results from our purchasing  storing  terminalling and selling operations are influenced by prices for refined petroleum products  pricing volatility and the market for such products 
prices in the overall forward market for refined petroleum products may impact our ability to execute advantageous purchasing opportunities 
in a contango market when product prices for future deliveries are higher than for current deliveries  we may use our storage capacity to improve our margins by storing products we have purchased at lower prices in the current market for delivery to customers at higher prices in the future 
in a backward market when product prices for future deliveries are lower than current deliveries  we attempt to minimize our inventories to reduce commodity risk and maintain or increase net product margins 
when prices for refined petroleum products rise  some of our customers may have insufficient credit to purchase supply from us at their historical purchase volumes  and their customers  in turn  may adopt conservation measures which reduce consumption  thereby reducing demand for product 
furthermore  when prices increase rapidly and dramatically  we may be unable to promptly pass our additional costs on to our customers  resulting in lower margins for us which could adversely affect our results of operation 
lastly  higher prices for refined petroleum products may diminish our access to trade credit support and or cause it to become more expensive and decrease the amount of borrowings available for working capital under our credit agreement as a result of total available commitments  borrowing base limitations and advance rates thereunder 
in addition  when prices for refined petroleum products decline  our exposure to risk of loss in the event of nonperformance by our customers of our forward contracts may be increased as they and or their customers may breach their contracts and purchase refined petroleum products at the then lower spot and or retail market price 
furthermore  lower prices for refined petroleum products may diminish the amount of borrowings available for working capital under our working capital revolving credit facility as a result of borrowing base limitations 

table of contents changes in government usage mandates and tax credits could adversely affect the availability and pricing of ethanol  which could negatively impact our gasoline sales 
future demand for ethanol will be largely dependent upon the economic incentives to blend based upon the relative value of gasoline and ethanol  taking into consideration the volumetric ethanol excise tax credit the blender credit and the epa regulations on the renewable fuels standard rfs program and oxygenate blending requirements 
a reduction or waiver of the rfs mandate or the oxygenate blending requirements or the failure to extend the blender credit could adversely affect the availability and pricing of ethanol  which in turn could adversely affect our future gasoline and ethanol sales 
please read item  business recent developments ethanol and rail expansion project 
new  stricter environmental laws and regulations could significantly increase our costs  which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations regulating product quality specifications and other environmental matters 
the trend in environmental regulation is towards more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment 
our business may be adversely affected by increased costs and liabilities resulting from such stricter laws and regulations 
we try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of such compliance 
however  there can be no assurances as to the timing and type of such changes in existing laws or the promulgation of new laws or the amount of any required expenditures associated therewith

results of operations evaluating our results of operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
these measurements include net product margin  gross profit  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  operating expenses  degree days  net income per diluted limited partner unit  ebitda and distributable cash flow 
net product margin we view net product margin as an important performance measure of the core profitability of our operations 
we review net product margin monthly for consistency and trend analysis 
we define net product margin as our sales minus product costs 
sales primarily include sales of unbranded and mobil branded gasoline  distillates  residual oil  small amounts of natural gas and renewable fuels and convenience store sales and gas station rental income 
product costs include the cost of acquiring the refined petroleum products  natural gas and renewable fuels that we sell and all associated costs including shipping and handling costs to bring such products to the point of sale 
we also look at net product margin on a per unit basis net product margin divided by volume 
net product margin is a non gaap financial measure used by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements to assess our business 
net product margin should not be considered as an alternative to net 
table of contents income  operating income  cash flow from operations  or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our net product margin may not be comparable to net product margin or a similarly titled measure of other companies 
gross profit we define gross profit as our sales minus product costs and terminal depreciation expense allocated to cost of sales 
sales primarily include sales of unbranded and mobil branded gasoline  distillates  residual oil and small amounts of natural gas and renewable fuels 
product costs include the cost of acquiring the refined petroleum products  natural gas and renewable fuels that we sell and all associated costs to bring such products to the point of sale 
selling  general and administrative expenses our sg a expenses include  among other things  marketing costs  corporate overhead  employee salaries and benefits  pension and k plan expenses  discretionary bonuses  non interest financing costs  professional fees and information technology expenses 
employee related expenses including employee salaries  discretionary bonuses and related payroll taxes  benefits  and pension and k plan expenses are paid by our general partner which  in turn  is reimbursed for these expenses by us 
operating expenses operating expenses are costs associated with the operation of the terminals and gasoline stations used in our business 
lease payments and storage expenses  maintenance and repair  utilities  taxes  labor and labor related expenses comprise the most significant portion of our operating expenses 
these expenses remain relatively stable independent of the volumes through our system but fluctuate slightly depending on the activities performed during a specific period 
degree day a degree day is an industry measurement of temperature designed to evaluate energy demand and consumption 
degree days are based on how far the average temperature departs from a human comfort level of f 
each degree of temperature above f is counted as one cooling degree day  and each degree of temperature below f is counted as one heating degree day 
degree days are accumulated each day over the course of a year and can be compared to a monthly or a long term multi year average  or normal  to see if a month or a year was warmer or cooler than usual 
degree days are officially observed by the national weather service and officially archived by the national climatic data center 
for purposes of evaluating our results of operations  we use the normal heating degree day amount as reported by the national weather service at its logan international airport station in boston  massachusetts 
net income per diluted limited partner unit we use net income per diluted limited partner unit to measure our financial performance on a per unit basis 
net income per diluted limited partner unit is defined as net income  divided by the weighted average number of outstanding diluted common and subordinated units  or limited partner units  during the period 

table of contents ebitda ebitda is a non gaap financial measure used as a supplemental financial measure by management and external users of our consolidated financial statements  such as investors  commercial banks and research analysts  to assess our compliance with certain financial covenants included in our debt agreements  our financial performance without regard to financing methods  capital structure  income taxes or historical cost basis  our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest on our indebtedness and to make distributions to our partners  our operating performance and return on invested capital as compared to those of other companies in the wholesale  marketing and distribution of refined petroleum products  without regard to financing methods and capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return of alternative investment opportunities 
ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income  cash flow from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  and this measure may vary among other companies 
therefore  ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
distributable cash flow distributable cash flow is an important non gaap financial measure for our limited partners since it serves as an indicator of our success in providing a cash return on their investment 
in december  we amended our partnership agreement to restate the provisions governing conversion of the subordinated units to use distributable cash flow to test whether we have earned the minimum quarterly distribution 
distributable cash flow means our net income plus depreciation and amortization minus maintenance capital expenditures  as well as adjustments to eliminate items approved by the audit committee of the board of directors of our general partner that are extraordinary or non recurring in nature and that would otherwise increase distributable cash flow 
specifically  this financial measure indicates to investors whether or not we have generated sufficient earnings on a current or historic level that can sustain or support an increase in our quarterly cash distribution 
distributable cash flow is a quantitative standard used by the investment community with respect to publicly traded partnerships 
distributable cash flow should not be considered as an alternative to net income  cash flow from operations  or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
in addition  our distributable cash flow may not be comparable to distributable cash flow or similarly titled measures of other companies 
years ended december   and in september  we acquired mobil branded retail gas stations located in massachusetts  new hampshire and rhode island 
additionally  we acquired the right to supply mobil branded gasoline and diesel fuel to such stations and to mobil branded stations that are owned and operated by independent dealers 
the acquisition expands our wholesale supply business and adds vertical integration to our transportation fuel business 
please read overview exxonmobil acquisition for a discussion of the transaction 
in june  we completed our acquisition of the warex terminals three refined petroleum products terminals located in newburgh  new york 
we believe the acquisition strengthens our 
table of contents presence along the hudson river in southeastern new york and enhances terminal operating efficiencies with our neighboring facility 
in addition  in october  we completed an ethanol and rail expansion project that adds  barrels of ethanol storage at our refined petroleum product terminal in albany  new york 
the project includes modifications that enable the terminal to schedule the delivery of car trains of ethanol and allows ethanol to be shipped directly on a single rail line from the midwest 
beyond supplying our own business  we further invested in our albany terminal by installing a marine vapor recovery system for barge vessel loading of ethanol and gasoline at the dock  and expanding the rack to allow for additional ethanol and gasoline sales 
we believe the supply efficiencies gained through this project position us to be a premier cost effective supplier of gasoline and ethanol to the northeast 
in a separate and complementary project  we are converting two distillate storage tanks to gasoline storage at the albany facility 
these initiatives  combined with the return to service of three previously out of service tanks  increased the total storage capacity of our albany terminal to approximately million barrels  up from  barrels when we acquired the terminal in may during the year ended december  refined petroleum product prices increased during compared to our aggregate volume of product sold increased by approximately for compared to primarily due to our gasoline business 
we expensed credit losses of approximately million 
temperatures for were warmer than normal and warmer than we believe heating oil conservation and consumption continued during we believe our results for the fourth quarter were negatively impacted due  in part  to adverse market conditions and fewer advantageous purchasing opportunities primarily in our distillates business 
although these factors continue to affect our business at the present time  we do not believe they are of a long term nature 
we believe that these market conditions and fewer purchasing opportunities did not adversely impact the performance of our gasoline business including the recent acquisition of retail gas stations and supply rights from exxonmobil 
during  we optimized our terminal network by initiating organic expansion and other projects  primarily in albany  new york  oyster bay  new york and linden  new jersey 
these projects added approximately million barrels of storage capacity  broadening the depth and breadth of our strategic asset base 
during the year ended december  refined petroleum product prices dramatically declined during the first three quarters of compared to the same periods in which we believe contributed to lower revenues and lower financing costs as a result of decreased borrowings to finance inventory 
refined petroleum product prices  however  dramatically increased during the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of due to the decline in refined petroleum product prices for most of and due to favorable market conditions  we elected to use our storage capacity to carry increased inventories of million as of december  compared december  temperatures for were colder than normal and colder than while temperatures were warmer than normal for 
table of contents we expensed credit losses of approximately million 
we believe heating oil conservation continued during even though prices declined 
we believe the overall economic conditions affected our distillates and gasoline results 
we continued to experience a decline in our residual oil sales and volumes 
in  we expanded our presence in providence  rhode island 
we entered into two separate sublease agreements in november for land located at the port of providence 
in january  the terminal at one parcel opened for business and has storage capacity of  barrels for distillates 
in november  the terminal at the other parcel opened for business and has storage capacity of  barrels for refined petroleum products 
these facilities will enable us to more effectively supply existing wholesale and commercial customers across rhode island and southeastern massachusetts and cultivate new customers in the region 
in  we experienced higher revenues and higher gasoline sales volumes  primarily due to our acquisitions of five refined petroleum products terminals from exxonmobil 
refined petroleum product and natural gas prices were higher during the first nine months of the year and generally peaked in july of before dramatically decreasing during the fourth quarter as evidenced in the table below 
during the year ended december  we believe increasing refined petroleum product prices for most of contributed to higher financing costs as a result of increased borrowings to finance inventory  the conversion or temporary switching by dual fuel users by primarily commercial customers to other products primarily natural gas from residual fuel and heating oil  and energy conservation 
a decrease in market demand for distillates and residual oil due to energy conservation and higher refined petroleum product prices for most of led to lower volumes sold and lower margins 
adverse market conditions in our markets  including volatility and backwardation  led to lower margins and intensified competition from other wholesalers 
temperatures were warmer than normal for as measured by aggregate heating degree days 
we expensed credit losses of approximately  we had fewer fixed priced sales of heating oil in during the first quarter of  the opportunistic conversion of certain gasoline markets to ethanol put us in a temporarily disadvantaged competitive position while our terminal infrastructure was being converted 
temporary logistical supply issues related to rail capacity adversely affected the performance of our burlington  vermont facility

subsequent changes in these estimates may have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations and are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we have identified the following estimates that  in our opinion  are subjective in nature  require the exercise of judgment and involve complex analysis inventory except for our convenience store inventory  we hedge substantially all of our inventory purchases through futures contracts and swap agreements 
hedges are executed when inventory is purchased and are identified with that specific inventory 
changes in the fair value of these contracts  as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged inventory item  are recognized in earnings as an increase or decrease in cost of sales 
all hedged inventory is valued using the lower of cost  as determined by specific identification  or market 
prior to sale  hedges are removed from specific barrels of inventory  and the then unhedged inventory is sold and accounted for on a first in  first out basis 
in addition to our own inventory  we have exchange agreements with unrelated third party suppliers  whereby we may draw inventory from these other suppliers and replace it at a later date 
similarly  these suppliers may draw inventory from us and replace it at a later date 
positive exchange balances are accounted for as accounts receivable 
negative exchange balances are accounted for as accounts payable 
exchange transactions are valued using current quoted market prices 
in addition  we have convenience store inventory which is carried at the lower of historical cost or market 
leases we have a throughput agreement with global petroleum corp  one of our affiliates  with respect to its terminal in revere  massachusetts 
this agreement is accounted for as an operating lease 
please read item  certain relationships and related transactions  and director independence throughput agreement with global petroleum corp 
we also have entered into terminal and throughput lease arrangements with various unrelated oil terminals  certain of which arrangements have minimum usage requirements 
please read items and  business and properties storage 
in addition  we lease certain gas stations from third parties under long term arrangements with various expiration dates 
we have future commitments  principally for office space and computer equipment  under the terms of operating lease arrangements 
we have rental income from gas stations leased to independents dealers and lease income from office space leased to an unrelated third party at one of our terminals 
additionally  we have capital leases for other computer equipment and leasehold improvements 
accounting and reporting guidance for leases requires that leases be evaluated and classified as operating or capital leases for financial reporting purposes 
the lease term used for lease evaluation includes option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the option period can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
revenue recognition sales relate primarily to the sale of refined petroleum products and natural gas and are recognized along with the related receivable upon delivery  net of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances 
allowances for cash discounts are recorded as a reduction of sales at the time of sale based on the estimated future outcome 
we also provide for shipping costs at the time of sale  which are included in cost of sales 
the amounts recorded for bad debts are generally based upon historically derived percentages while also factoring in any new business conditions that might impact the historical analysis  such as market conditions and bankruptcies of particular customers 
bad debt provisions are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
convenience store products are recognized net 
table of contents of applicable provisions for discounts and allowances upon delivery  generally  at the point of sale 
rental income is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
revenue is not recognized on exchange agreements  which are entered into primarily to acquire various refined petroleum products of a desired quality or to reduce transportation costs by taking delivery of products closer to our end markets 
any net differential for exchange agreements is recorded as a nonmonetary adjustment of inventory costs in the purchases component of cost of sales in the statement of income 
derivative financial instruments accounting and reporting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities requires that an entity recognize derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and measure the instruments at fair value 
changes in the fair value of the derivative are to be recognized currently in earnings  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
fair value hedges the fair value of our derivatives is determined through the use of independent markets and is based upon the prevailing market prices of such instruments at the date of valuation 
we enter into futures contracts for the receipt or delivery of refined petroleum products in future periods 
the contracts are entered into in the normal course of business to reduce risk of loss of inventory on hand  which could result through fluctuations in market prices 
changes in the fair value of these contracts  as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged inventory item  are recognized in earnings as an increase or decrease in cost of sales 
we also use futures contracts and swap agreements to hedge exposure under forward purchase and sale commitments 
these agreements are intended to hedge the cost component of virtually all of our forward purchase and sale commitments 
changes in the fair value of these contracts  as well as offsetting gains or losses on the forward fixed price purchase and sale commitments  are recognized in earnings as an increase or decrease in cost of sales 
gains and losses on net product margin from forward fixed price purchase and sale contracts are reflected in earnings as an increase or decrease in cost of sales as these contracts mature 
we also market and sell natural gas 
we generally conduct business by entering into forward purchase commitments for natural gas only when we simultaneously enter into arrangements for the sale of product for physical delivery to third party users 
we generally take delivery under our purchase commitments at the same location as we deliver to third party users 
through these transactions  which establish an immediate margin  we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced between firm forward purchase and sales commitments 
natural gas is generally purchased and sold at fixed prices and quantities 
current price quotes from actively traded markets are used in all cases to determine the contracts fair value 
changes in the fair value of these contracts are recognized in earnings as an increase or decrease in cost of sales 
interest rate hedges we link all hedges that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions 
to the extent such hedges are effective  the changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument are reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest expense in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
we executed two zero premium interest rate collars with major financial institutions 
each collar is designated as a cash flow hedge 
the first collar  which expires on may   is used to hedge the variability in interest payments due to changes in the three month libor rate with respect to million of three month libor based borrowings 
under the first collar  we capped our exposure at a maximum three month libor rate of and established a minimum floor rate of 
the changes in the fair value of the first collar are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in interest rate payments attributable to fluctuations in the three month libor rate above and below the first collar strike rates 
the second collar  which expires on october   is used to hedge the variability in cash 
table of contents flows in monthly interest payments made on our million one month libor based borrowings and subsequent refinancings thereof due to changes in the one month libor rate 
under the second collar  we capped our exposure at a maximum one month libor rate of and established a minimum floor rate of 
the changes in the fair value of the second collar are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in interest rate payments attributable to fluctuations in the one month libor rate above and below the second collar strike rates 
changes in the fair values of the collars are recorded as either an asset or a liability with a corresponding amount recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
forward starting swap in october  we executed a forward starting swap with a major financial institution 
the swap  which will become effective on may  and expire on may   will be used to hedge the variability in interest payments due to changes in the one month libor swap curve with respect to million of one month libor based borrowings at a fixed rate of 
hedge effectiveness was assessed at inception and will be assessed quarterly  prospectively and retrospectively  using regression analysis 
the changes in the fair value of the swap are expected to be highly effective in offsetting the changes in interest rate payments attributable to fluctuations in the one month libor swap curve 
valuation of intangibles and other long lived assets we assess the carrying value of our long lived assets  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future results  significant negative industry factors and significant changes in strategy or operations that negatively affect the utilization of our long lived assets 
if an impairment review is triggered  we evaluate the carrying value of intangible assets based on the projected cash flows of the particular asset 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on fair value  which is determined using projected discounted future operating cash flows 
the cash flows that are used contain our best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
if the cash flow estimates or the significant operating assumptions upon which they are based change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
environmental and other liabilities we record accrued liabilities for all direct costs associated with the estimated resolution of contingencies at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
costs accrued are estimated based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies and outcomes 
estimated losses from environmental remediation obligations generally are recognized no later than completion of the remedial feasibility study 
loss accruals are adjusted as further information becomes available or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value 
recoveries of environmental remediation costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
we are subject to other contingencies  including legal proceedings and claims arising out of our businesses that cover a wide range of matters  including  among others  environmental matters  contract and employment claims 
environmental and other legal proceedings may also include matters with respect to businesses we previously owned 
further  due to the lack of adequate information and the potential impact of present regulations and any future regulations  there are certain circumstances in which no range of potential exposure may be reasonably estimated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
the principal market risks to which we are exposed are interest rate risk and commodity risk 
we utilize two interest rate collars and a forward starting swap to manage exposure to interest rate risk and various derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity risk 
interest rate risk we utilize variable rate debt and are exposed to market risk due to the floating interest rates on our credit agreement 
therefore  from time to time  we utilize interest rate collars and swaps to hedge interest obligations on specific and anticipated debt issuances 
on august   we amended our credit agreement 
please read item  management discussion and analysis liquidity and capital resources credit agreement for information on interest rates related to our borrowings 
as of december   we had total borrowings outstanding under the credit agreement of million 
the impact of a increase in the interest rate on this amount of debt would have resulted in an increase in interest expense  and a corresponding decrease in our results of operations  of approximately million annually  assuming  however  that our indebtedness remained constant throughout the year 
we executed two zero premium interest rate collars with major financial institutions 
each collar is designated and accounted for as a cash flow hedge 
the first collar  which became effective on may  and expires on may   is used to hedge the variability in interest payments due to changes in the three month libor rate with respect to million of three month libor based borrowings 
under the first collar  we capped our exposure at a maximum three month libor rate of and established a minimum floor rate of 
whenever the three month libor rate is greater than the cap  we receive from the respective financial institution the difference between the cap and the current three month libor rate on the million of three month libor based borrowings 
conversely  whenever the three month libor rate is lower than the floor  we remit to the respective financial institution the difference between the floor and the current three month libor rate on the million of three month libor based borrowings 
as of december   the three month libor rate of was lower than the floor rate 
as a result  in january  we remitted to the respective financial institution the difference between the floor rate and the current rate which amounted to approximately on september   we executed our second zero premium interest rate collar 
the second collar  which became effective on october  and expires on october   is used to hedge the variability in cash flows in monthly interest payments made on our million one month libor based borrowings and subsequent refinancings thereof due to changes in the one month libor rate 
under the second collar  we capped our exposure at a maximum one month libor rate of and established a minimum floor rate of 
whenever the one month libor rate is greater than the 
table of contents cap  we receive from the respective financial institution the difference between the cap and the current one month libor rate on the million of one month libor based borrowings 
conversely  whenever the one month libor rate is lower than the floor  we remit to the respective financial institution the difference between the floor and the current one month libor rate on the million of one month libor based borrowings 
as of december   the one month libor rate of was lower than the floor rate 
as a result  in january  we remitted to the respective financial institution the difference between the floor rate and the current rate which amounted to approximately  in addition  in october  we executed a forward starting swap with a major financial institution 
the swap  which will become effective on may  and expire on may   will be used to hedge the variability in interest payments due to changes in the one month libor swap curve with respect to million of one month libor based borrowings at a fixed rate of 
commodity risk we hedge our exposure to price fluctuations with respect to refined petroleum products and blendstocks in storage and expected purchases and sales of these commodities 
the derivative instruments utilized consist primarily of futures contracts traded on the nymex and the chicago mercantile exchange and over the counter transactions  including swap agreements entered into with established financial institutions and other credit approved energy companies 
our policy is generally to purchase only products for which we have a market and to structure our sales contracts so that price fluctuations do not materially affect our profit 
while our policies are designed to minimize market risk  some degree of exposure to unforeseen fluctuations in market conditions remains 
except for the controlled trading program discussed below  we do not acquire and hold futures contracts or other derivative products for the purpose of speculating on price changes that might expose us to indeterminable losses 
while we seek to maintain a position that is substantially balanced within our product purchase activities  we may experience net unbalanced positions for short periods of time as a result of variances in daily sales and transportation and delivery schedules as well as logistical issues associated with inclement weather conditions 
in connection with managing these positions and maintaining a constant presence in the marketplace  both necessary for our business  we engage in a controlled trading program for up to an aggregate of  barrels of refined petroleum products and blendstocks at any one point in time 
we enter into futures contracts to minimize or hedge the impact of market fluctuations on our purchases and forward fixed price sales of refined petroleum products 
any hedge ineffectiveness is reflected in our results of operations 
we utilize regulated exchanges  including the nymex and the chicago mercantile exchange  which are regulated exchanges for energy products that it trades  thereby reducing potential delivery and supply risks 
generally  our practice is to close all exchange positions rather than to make or receive physical deliveries 
with respect to other energy products  which may not have a correlated exchange contract  we enter into derivative agreements with counterparties that we believe have a strong credit profile  in order to hedge market fluctuations and or lock in margins relative to our commitments 

table of contents at december   the fair value of all of our commodity risk derivative instruments and the change in fair value that would be expected from a price increase or decrease are shown in the table below in thousands gain loss fair value effect of price increase effect of price decrease nymex contracts swaps  options and other  net the fair values of the futures contracts are based on quoted market prices obtained from the nymex 
the fair value of the swaps and option contracts are estimated based on quoted prices from various sources such as independent reporting services  industry publications and brokers 
these quotes are compared to the contract price of the swap  which approximates the gain or loss that would have been realized if the contracts had been closed out at december  for positions where independent quotations are not available  an estimate is provided  or the prevailing market price at which the positions could be liquidated is used 
all hedge positions offset physical exposures to the spot market  none of these offsetting physical exposures are included in the above table 
price risk sensitivities were calculated by assuming an across the board increase or decrease in price regardless of term or historical relationships between the contractual price of the instruments and the underlying commodity price 
in the event of an actual change in prompt month prices  the fair value of our derivative portfolio would typically change less than that shown in the table due to lower volatility in out month prices 
we have a daily margin requirement to maintain a cash deposit with our broker based on the prior day market results on open futures contracts 
the balance of this deposit will fluctuate based on our open market positions and the commodity exchange requirements 
the brokerage margin balance was million at december  we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties of futures contracts  forward contracts and swap agreements 
we anticipate some nonperformance by some of these counterparties which  in the aggregate  we do not believe at this time will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
futures contracts  the primary derivative instrument utilized  are traded on regulated exchanges  greatly reducing potential credit risks 
exposure on swap and certain option agreements is limited to the amount of the recorded fair value as of the balance sheet dates 
we utilize primarily one clearing broker  a major financial institution  for all nymex derivative transactions and the right of offset exists 
accordingly  the fair value of all derivative instruments is displayed on a net basis
