item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are an integrated manufacturer  marketer  distributor and retailer of branded nutritional supplements and other natural products sold primarily to and through domestic health and natural food stores 
internationally  we market and distribute branded nutritional supplements and other natural products to and through health and natural product distributors and retailers 
our core business strategy is to acquire  integrate and operate businesses in the natural products industry that manufacture  market and distribute branded nutritional supplements 
we believe that the consolidation and integration of these acquired businesses provides ongoing financial synergies through increased scale and market penetration  as well as strengthened customer relationships 
we manufacture and sell nutritional supplements and other natural products under numerous brands including solaray  kal  nature life  lifetime  natural balance  bioallers  herbs for kids  naturalcare  health from the sun  life flo  organix south  pioneer and monarch nutraceuticals 
we own neighborhood natural food markets  which operate under the trade names the real food company  thom natural foods and cornucopia community market 
we also own health food stores  which operate under the trade names fresh vitamins and granola 
we manufacture and or distribute one of the broadest branded product lines in the industry with over  skus  including approximately skus sold internationally 
we believe that as a result of our emphasis on innovation  quality  loyalty  education and customer service  our brands are widely recognized in health and natural food stores and among their customers 
we were formed in to effect a consolidation strategy in the fragmented vms industry 
since our formation  we have completed thirty five acquisitions 
we believe that nutraceutical is well positioned to continue to capitalize on the consolidation we believe is occurring in the vms industry 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america required us to make estimates and assumptions that affected the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses during the reported periods 
significant estimates included values and lives assigned to acquired intangible assets  reserves for customer returns and allowances  uncollectible accounts receivable  valuation adjustments for slow moving  obsolete and or damaged inventory and valuation and recoverability of long lived assets 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies and estimates include the following accounts receivable provision is made for estimated bad debts based on a periodic analysis of individual customer balances  including an evaluation of days sales outstanding  payment history  recent payment trends and perceived credit worthiness 
if general economic conditions and or customer financial condition were to change  additional provisions for bad debts may be required  which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
inventories valuation adjustments are made for slow moving  obsolete and or damaged inventory based on a periodic analysis of individual inventory items  including an evaluation of historical usage and or movement  age  expiration date and general condition 
if market demand and or consumer 
table of contents preferences are less favorable than historical trends or future expectations  additional valuation adjustments for slow moving  obsolete and or damaged inventory may be required  which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
property  plant and equipment depreciation and amortization expense is impacted by our judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of assets placed in service 
if the estimated lives of assets are significantly less than expected  depreciation and amortization expense would be accelerated  which could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment which are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of the asset group by comparison of its carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset group is expected to generate 
if the asset group is considered to be impaired  the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired asset group is recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets require estimates and judgments in determining the initial recognition and measurement  including factors and assumptions used in determining fair value and useful lives 
intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized  while intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually for impairment and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs that would cause us to believe that value is impaired 
the appropriateness of the indefinite life classification of non amortizable intangible assets is also reviewed as part of the annual testing or when circumstances warrant a change to a finite life 
we perform our annual impairment testing as of september each year  which is the last day of our fiscal year 
a two step process is used to test for goodwill impairment 
the first step is to determine if there is an indication of impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including existing goodwill 
reporting unit fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow models as well as considering market and other factors 
goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value 
upon an indication of impairment  a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with its carrying value 
intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at the individual tradename level by comparing the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible asset to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of an indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recognized 
fair values of indefinite lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows 
amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability by comparing an asset group carrying amount to the future undiscounted cash flows the asset group is expected to generate 
if the asset group is considered to be impaired  the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the impaired asset group is recorded 
for fiscal  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million million after tax  or per diluted share related to our branded and natural food markets reporting units and we recorded a non cash intangible asset impairment charge of million million after tax  or per diluted share related to certain tradenames 
the fiscal non cash goodwill impairment charge and non cash intangible asset impairment charge had no impact on our compliance with debt covenants  cash flows or available liquidity 
the ongoing uncertainty in general and economic conditions may continue to impact retail and consumer demand  as well as the market price of our common stock  and could negatively impact our 
table of contents future operating performance  cash flow and or stock price and could result in additional goodwill and or intangible asset impairment charges being recorded in future periods which could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
there were no at risk reporting units at september  the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets is subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped and the customer takes ownership and assumes the risk of loss  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we believe that these criteria are satisfied upon shipment from our facilities or  in the case of our neighborhood natural food markets and health food stores  at the point of sale within these stores 
revenue is reduced by provisions for estimated returns and allowances  which are based on historical averages that have not varied significantly for the periods presented  as well as specific known claims  if any 
no other significant deductions from revenue must be estimated at the point in time that revenue is recognized 
other than our previous discussion of goodwill and intangible asset impairment  our estimates and judgments related to our critical accounting policies  including factors and assumptions considered in making these estimates and judgments  did not vary significantly for the periods presented and had no material impact on the consolidated financial statements as reported 
for additional information on our accounting policies  see note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements

provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to an increase in the domestic production deduction rate 
in each period  our effective tax rate was higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state taxes 
comparison of fiscal to fiscal revisions of prior periods 
as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  we have historically performed impairment testing on our portfolio of indefinite lived trademarks and tradenames collectively tradenames on an aggregate basis 
in connection with our annual indefinite lived intangible impairment testing for the year ended september   we re evaluated the guidance in asc through and determined that our testing of indefinite lived tradenames should have been at the individual tradename level rather than on an aggregate basis 
based on this revised methodology  we determined that we should have previously recorded a non cash impairment charge for certain of our tradenames of million million after tax  or per diluted share for the year ended september  consequently  we have revised our previously issued financial statements to reflect this non cash impairment charge for certain of our tradenames 
net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal net sales of branded nutritional supplements and other natural products increased by million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase in net sales of branded nutritional supplements and other natural products was primarily related to the net sales contributions of the four fiscal acquisitions and the fiscal acquisition

interest and other expense  net 
net interest and other expense was million for fiscal and million for fiscal and primarily consisted of interest expense on indebtedness under our revolving credit facility with the decrease being primarily related to a reduction in interest rates 
provision benefit for income taxes 
our effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million of which million related to non tax deductible goodwill and we recorded a non cash intangible asset impairment charge of million 
the non cash impairment charge related to non tax deductible goodwill reduced our effective tax rate from to for fiscal selected quarterly financial data  seasonality the following table sets forth certain quarterly financial data for fiscal and fiscal this quarterly information is unaudited  has been prepared on the same basis as the annual financial statements and  in our opinion  reflects all normally recurring adjustments necessary for fair presentation of the information for the periods presented 
operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
fiscal fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter dollars in thousands  except per share data unaudited net sales gross profit net income net income per common share basic diluted we believe that our business is characterized by minor seasonality 
however  sales to any particular customer can vary substantially from one quarter to the next based on such factors as industry trends  timing of promotional discounts  international economic conditions and acquisition related activities 
excluding the effect of acquisitions  we have historically recorded higher branded products sales volume 
table of contents during the second fiscal quarter due to increased interest in health related products among consumers following the holiday season 
the fiscal acquisitions were completed during the first  second  third and fourth quarters and the fiscal acquisitions were completed during the first  third and fourth quarters 
liquidity and capital resources as of september   we had cash of million 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase in cash provided by changes in assets and liabilities  net of effects of acquisitions 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
our investing activities during these periods consisted of acquisitions of businesses and capital expenditures 
during the year ended september   we made five acquisitions of businesses 
on october   we acquired certain operating assets of trc nutritional labs  inc on october   we acquired certain operating assets of the heritage store  inc on february   we acquired certain operating assets of sunfeather natural soap company  inc on may   we acquired certain operating assets of skin by ann webb  llc 
on september   we acquired certain operating assets of transitions for health  inc  dba emerita 
the aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions was million in cash 
during the year ended september   we made four acquisitions of businesses 
on october   we acquired from nutritional specialties  inc and its parent corporation  baywood international  inc  substantially all of the operating assets of the lifetime products nutritional supplement business excluding the ready to drink beverage business  which continued after closing under the company new name  new leaf brands  inc on december   we acquired substantially all of the assets of organix south  inc on april   we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of honey gardens apiaries  inc and apitherapy  llc 
on july   we acquired substantially all of the operating assets of nutritech corporation 
the aggregate purchase price of these acquisitions was million in cash 
the fiscal and fiscal acquisitions were financed primarily using borrowings under our revolving credit facility  as well as cash provided by operating activities 
these acquisitions are in keeping with our business strategy of consolidating the fragmented industry where we compete and give us nutritional brands with products we currently do not sell 
the expected long term sales and expense synergies of acquired businesses are generally not realized immediately following acquisition as certain transition and integration matters must be completed 
capital expenditures during the years ended september   and related primarily to buildings  building improvements related to facility consolidation efforts  distribution and manufacturing equipment and information systems 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended september   and  respectively 
our financing activities during these periods consisted primarily of borrowings and repayments under our revolving credit facility related to operating needs  payments of deferred financing fees  purchases of common stock for treasury and proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
in october  we registered a direct stock purchase plan with the securities and exchange commission 
the purpose of this direct stock purchase plan is to provide a convenient way for existing stockholders  as well as new investors  to purchase shares of our common stock 
a total of  
table of contents shares of our common stock were registered under the plan with  and  shares purchased during the years ended september  and  respectively 
on december   we amended and restated our revolving credit facility the restated credit agreement 
the restated credit agreement extends the term of the credit facility to december  resets the available credit borrowings to million with no automatic reductions and provides an accordion feature which can increase the available credit borrowings to million subject to approval by the lenders and compliance with certain covenants and conditions 
the lenders under the restated credit agreement are rabobank international and wells fargo 
to date  we have not experienced any difficulties in accessing the available funds under the restated credit agreement 
deferred financing fees of million related to the restated credit agreement were deferred and are being amortized over the term of the restated credit agreement 
at september   we had outstanding revolving credit borrowings of million under the restated credit agreement 
borrowings under the restated credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
at our election  borrowings bear interest at the applicable eurodollar rate plus a variable margin or at a base rate  which is the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime lending rate  plus a variable margin 
at september   the applicable weighted average interest rate for outstanding borrowings was 
we are also required to pay a quarterly fee of on the unused balance under the restated credit agreement 
accrued interest on eurodollar rate borrowings is payable based on elected intervals of one  two or three months 
accrued interest on base rate borrowings is payable quarterly 
the restated credit agreement matures on december   and we are required to repay all principal and interest outstanding under the restated credit agreement on such date 
the restated credit agreement contains restrictive covenants  including restrictions on incurring other indebtedness and requirements that we maintain certain financial ratios 
as of september   we were in compliance with these restrictive covenants 
upon the occurrence of a default or an event of default  the lender has various remedies or rights  which may include proceeding against the collateral or requiring us to repay all amounts outstanding under the restated credit agreement 
a key component of our business strategy is to seek to make additional acquisitions  which may require that we obtain additional financing  which could include the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness 
we believe that borrowings under the restated credit agreement or a replacement credit facility  together with cash flows from operations  will be sufficient to make required payments under the restated credit agreement or any such replacement facility  and to make anticipated capital expenditures and fund working capital needs for fiscal our significant non cancelable contractual obligations and other commitments as of september  were as follows payments due by period contractual obligations and other commitments total less than year years years after years dollars in thousands debt interest on debt a operating leases total a represents estimated interest obligations associated with our outstanding revolving credit facility balance of million at september   assuming no principal payments are made before maturity  a weighted average interest rate of and an underutilization fee of 

table of contents new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance which is included in accounting standards codification asc  comprehensive income 
this guidance no longer allows comprehensive income to be presented as a component of the statement of stockholders equity but instead requires comprehensive income to be presented either in a continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this guidance is effective for us as of october  and will not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements as the guidance only changes the presentation of comprehensive income 
in september  the fasb issued authoritative guidance which is included in asc  intangibles goodwill and other 
this guidance simplifies how goodwill is tested for impairment by first allowing an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test 
this guidance is effective for us as of october  and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
we periodically review new accounting standards that are issued 
although some of these accounting standards may be applicable to us  we have not identified any other new standards that we believe merit further discussion  and we expect that none would have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
inflation inflation affects the cost of raw materials  goods and services used by us 
in recent years  inflation has been modest 
the competitive environment somewhat limits our ability to recover higher costs resulting from inflation by raising prices 
we seek to mitigate the adverse effects of inflation primarily through improved productivity and cost containment programs 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations for the periods presented  except with respect to increased costs in manufacturing  packaging and distribution resulting from increased fuel and other petrochemical costs  as well as payroll related costs  insurance premiums  and other costs arising from or related to government imposed regulations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at our election  borrowings under the restated credit agreement bear interest at the applicable eurodollar rate plus a variable margin or at a base rate  which is the higher of the federal funds rate plus or the prime lending rate  plus a variable margin 
at september   the applicable weighted average interest rate for borrowings was and we had total borrowings outstanding of million 
a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates would not have had a material impact on our reported net income loss or cash flows in fiscal  or with respect to our international operations  we are subject to currency fluctuations  however  we do not believe that these fluctuations would have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations because the majority of our net sales to foreign countries are transacted in us dollars 
net sales to foreign countries not transacted in us dollars included sales to customers in norway  sweden  the united kingdom  the netherlands and japan 
to date  we have not hedged any of our potential foreign currency exposures
