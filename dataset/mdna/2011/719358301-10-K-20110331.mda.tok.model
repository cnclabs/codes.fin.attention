item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
introduction  outlook and overview of business operations our current strategic focus is built upon four key components leveraging our sales force through training focused on superior skin health expertise and incremental product offerings  expanded international capabilities  the development of alternate channels for our varied product lines and a renewed commitment to innovation of our technologies 
we concentrate our strategic efforts primarily in the physician market both domestically and internationally 
supporting those efforts management has initiated a renewed commitment to innovation  whereby we look to maximize the application of our technologies and utilize the significant scientific resources available to us in each of our product areas 
in the us we market and sell our products through a direct sales organization capable of addressing each product area with specific expertise 
our focus on enhanced training of the sales organization has created the ability to drive sales and to support our customer base with a leaner and more cost effective sales force since the strategy change in and  finally we look to leverage our experience and substantial product advancements in the physician market into non physician based markets  or alternate channels  that may benefit from those technological advancements 
on january   we reorganized our business into four operating units which resulted in a change in reportable segments 
for financial reporting purposes  we view our current business as comprised of the following four business segments physician domestic  physician international  other channels  and surgical products 
physician domestic in early  we modified our discrete product sales approach for each of our segments and implemented a strategy to develop a skin health solutions based sales force 
we believe this solutions based sales force is cost efficient  more productive and scalable and can better increase sales and financial leverage while providing solutions across our product suite to our customers 
our xtrac treatment services are a us based business with revenues generally derived from procedures performed by dermatologists 
we are engaged in the development  manufacturing and marketing of our proprietary xtrac excimer laser and delivery systems and techniques used in the treatment of inflammatory skin disorders  including psoriasis  vitiligo  atopic dermatitis and leukoderma 
as part of our commercialization strategy in the united states  we generally offer the xtrac laser system to targeted dermatologists at no initial capital cost to those dermatologists 
under this contractual arrangement  we maintain ownership of the laser and generally earn revenue each time a physician treats a patient with the equipment 
we believe this arrangement will increase market penetration 
we also may sell the laser directly to the customer for certain reasons  including the costs of logistical support and customer preference and as a means of addressing under performing accounts while still preserving a vendor customer relationship 
we believe that we are thus able to reach  at reasonable margins  a sector of the laser market that is better suited to a sale model than a per procedure model 
for the last several years we have sought to obtain health insurance coverage for xtrac laser therapy to treat inflammatory skin disease  particularly psoriasis 
we now benefit from the fact that  by our estimates  more than of the insured united states population are covered by policies that provide nearly full reimbursement for the treatment of psoriasis by means of an excimer laser 
our skincare products are aimed at the growing demand for skin health and hair care products  including products to enhance appearance and address the effects of aging on skin and hair 
our skincare products are formulated and branded for and targeted at specific markets 
our initial products addressed the dermatology and plastic and cosmetic surgery markets for use after various procedures 
we added anti aging skincare products to offer a comprehensive approach for a patient s skincare regimen 
in addition to our copper peptide based skincare products  in  we introduced dna topical products  which include dna nourishing lotion and dna total repair which use innovative technology to address the effects of photo damage 
in september  we launched combination therapy products by uniquely combining copper peptide complex and dna repair technologies 
these products are designed to activate self healing  boost essential skin cell function and maximize results for sustained skin health 
the products include refining eye lift  eye therapy  day therapy spf  night therapy  cr me de la copper and maximum body repair 
our ptl products are non laser light aesthetic devices for the treatment of a range of clinical and non clinical dermatological conditions 
we have incorporated our ptl technology offering into professional products comprising the omnilux systems for the medical market 
our ptl business has a portfolio of independent  experimental research that supports the efficacy and safety of our omnilux technology system 
based on a patented technology platform comprised of a unique light emitting diode led array  our omnilux technology delivers narrow band  spectrally pure light of specific intensity  wavelength and dose to achieve clinically proven results via a process called photo bio modulation 
since this technology generates nearly no heat  a patient feels no pain or discomfort  resulting in improved regime compliance and a higher likelihood of repeat procedures  this is in direct contrast to the current laser light based technologies serving the aesthetics market today 
our ptl led products compete in the professional aesthetics device market for led aesthetic medical procedures as well as other non medical markets around the world 
physician international our international operations and selling approach have been realigned and management believes our international organization has been dramatically enhanced through two initiatives 
first  we have entered into an expanded management relationship with the lotus global group  inc  doing business as globalmed technologies co  or globalmed  with respect to our laser and light based devices 
globalmed is an international distribution and management company focused on creating increased market opportunity through the engagement and management of local in country distributors and providing assistance in expediting regulatory approvals 
historically  globalmed managed our distribution relationships in the pacific rim for the xtrac and vtrac product lines  which represented a majority of our total international device sales 
as a result of its success in managing our pacific rim distribution relationships  we have now expanded globalmed s responsibilities to include all of our laser and light based devices in substantially all markets outside of the us second  we have begun to undertake significant efforts to expand the international reach of our skincare business in both the physician and consumer channels by reformulating our current products to meet local standards and registering these products in major international markets 
third  we have made the xtrac easier to maintain at the distributor locations  employing a modular approach to replacement of chambers 
these are the first steps in the implementation of our international skincare expansion strategy 
in the international market  we derive revenues by selling our dermatology laser and lamp systems and replacement parts to distributors and directly to physicians 
in this market  we have benefited from both our clinical studies and from the improved reliability and functionality of the xtrac laser system 
compared to the domestic segment  the sales of laser and lamp systems in the international segment are influenced to a greater degree by competition from similar laser technologies as well as non laser lamp alternatives 
over time  this competition has reduced the prices we are able to charge to international distributors for our xtrac products 
to compete with other non laser uvb products  we offer a lower priced  lamp based system called the vtrac 
we have expanded the international marketing of the vtrac since its introduction in the vtrac is used to treat psoriasis and vitiligo 
in addition  we also derive revenues by selling our skincare and ptl products to distributors in international markets 
other channels in the other channels segment  we derive revenues by selling our skincare and haircare products through non physician channels 
in addition  through our ptl products we derive revenues from the sale of the lumiere systems in the non medical professional market and our hand held consumer devices in various on line and television retail channels 
we are focused on expanding our sales to non physician related channels  including the indoor tanning and spa markets and in store  on line and television retail channels 
we access the indoor tanning and spa markets either through direct relationships with multiple location market participants or indirectly through industry leading distributors 
to further expand our retail channels  we have entered into a relationship with globalbeauty group  or globalbeauty  to assist in the development of new sales channels in the direct to consumer skincare market  including in store  on line and television retail channels 
globalbeauty connects product focused companies with emerging retail channels in order to expand domestic and international market opportunities 
surgical products our surgical products segment generates revenues by selling laser products and disposables to hospitals and surgery centers both within and outside of the united states 
also included in this segment are various non laser surgical products eg the clearess ii suction irrigation system 
we believe that sales of surgical laser systems and the related disposable base will tend to erode as hospitals continue to seek outsourcing solutions instead of purchasing lasers and related disposables for their operating rooms 
we are working to offset such erosion by increasing sales of the diode surgical laser  including original equipment manufacturer oem arrangements 
sales and marketing as of december   our sales and marketing personnel consisted of full time positions directed to sales as follows in physician domestic  three in physician international and three in other channels 
sale of surgical services business our surgical services segment was a fee based procedures business using mobile surgical laser equipment operated by our technicians at hospitals and surgery centers in the united states 
we decided to sell this division primarily because the growth rates and operating margins of the division had decreased as the business changed to rely more heavily upon procedures performed using equipment from third party suppliers  thereby limiting the profit potential of these services 
on august   we sold certain assets of the business  including accounts receivable  inventory and equipment  for  reverse stock split on february   we completed a reverse split of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock at a ratio of for  whereby  once effective  every six shares of our common stock was exchanged for one share of our common stock 
our common stock began trading on nasdaq on a reverse stock split adjusted basis at the market opening on february  as of december  we had  shares of common stock outstanding on a post split basis  taking into account the rounding up of fractional shares 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in this report are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable  inventories  impairment of property and equipment and of intangibles  and accruals for warranty claims 
we use authoritative pronouncements  historical experience and other assumptions as the basis for making estimates 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these critical accounting policies and the significant estimates made in accordance with these policies have been discussed with our audit committee 
revenue recognition 
xtrac related operations we have two distribution channels for our phototherapy treatment equipment 
we either x sell the laser through a distributor or directly to a physician or y place the laser in a physician s offices at no charge to the physician and generally charge the physician a fee for an agreed upon number of treatments 
in some cases  we and the customer stipulate to a quarterly or other periodic target of procedures to be performed  and accordingly revenue is recognized ratably over the period 
when we sell an xtrac laser to a distributor or directly to a foreign or domestic physician  revenue is recognized when the following four criteria have been met i the product has been shipped and we have no significant remaining obligations  ii persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  iii the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection is probable 
the criteria described in the clauses i through iv are collectively referred to as the criteria 
at times  units are shipped  but revenue is not recognized until all of the criteria have been met  and until that time  the unit is carried on our books as inventory 
we ship most of our products fob shipping point  although from time to time certain customers  for example governmental customers  will insist upon fob destination 
among the factors we take into account in determining the proper time at which to recognize revenue are when title to the goods transfers and when the risk of loss transfers 
shipments to distributors or physicians that do not fully satisfy the collection criteria are recognized when invoiced amounts are fully paid or assured 
under the terms of our distributor agreements  distributors do not have a unilateral right to return any unit that they have purchased 
however  we do allow products to be returned  under warranty  by our distributors for product defects or other claims 
when we place a laser in a physician s office  we generally recognize service revenue based on the number of patient treatments performed  or purchased under a periodic commitment  by the physician 
treatments to be performed through random laser access codes that are sold to physicians free of a periodic commitment  but not yet used  are deferred and recognized as a liability until the physician performs the treatment 
unused treatments remain an obligation of ours because the treatments can only be performed on our equipment 
once the treatments are delivered to a patient  this obligation has been satisfied 
we defer substantially all sales of treatment codes ordered by and delivered to our customers within the last two weeks of the period in determining the amount of procedures performed by our physician customers 
our management believes this approach closely approximates the actual number of unused treatments that existed at the end of a period 
for the years ended december  and  we deferred  and  respectively  under this approach 
skin care operations we generate revenues from our skin care business primarily through product sales for skin health  hair care and wound care 
we recognize revenues on the products and copper peptide compound when they are shipped  net of returns and allowances 
we ship the products fob shipping point 
photo therapeutics operations we have generated revenues from our photo therapeutics business primarily from two channels 
the first is through product sales of leds and skincare products 
the second has been through milestone payments and potential royalty payments from a licensing agreement 
we have recognized revenues from the product sales  including sales to distributors and other customers  when the criteria have been met 
we recognize the milestone payments when the milestones have been achieved and potential royalty revenues as they are earned from the licensee 
the licensee has opted not to continue its development activities under the license  and therefore we anticipate no further milestone payments unless and until we secure a replacement distribution partner 
surgical products and service operations we generate revenues from our surgical products business primarily from product sales of laser systems  related maintenance service agreements  recurring laser delivery systems and laser accessories 
domestic sales generally are direct to the end user  though we have some sales to or through a small number of domestic distributors  foreign sales are to distributors 
we recognize revenues from surgical laser and other product sales  including sales to distributors and other customers  when the criteria have been met 
revenue from maintenance service agreements is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreements 
revenue from billable services  including repair activity  is recognized when the service is provided 
inventory 
we account for inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market 
cost is determined to be purchased cost for raw materials and the production cost materials  labor and indirect manufacturing cost for work in process and finished goods 
throughout the laser manufacturing process  the related production costs are recorded within inventory 
work in process is immaterial  given the typically short manufacturing cycle  and therefore is disclosed in conjunction with raw materials 
we perform full physical inventory counts for xtrac and cycle counts on the other inventory to maintain controls and obtain accurate data 
our xtrac laser is either i sold to distributors or physicians directly or ii placed in a physician office and remains our property 
the cost to build a laser  whether for sale or for placement  is accumulated in inventory 
when a laser is placed in a physician s office  the cost is transferred from inventory to lasers in service within property and equipment 
at times  units are shipped to distributors  but revenue is not recognized until all of the criteria have been met  and until that time  the unit is carried on our books as inventory 
revenue is not recognized from these distributors until payment is either assured or paid in full 
reserves for slow moving and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and product demand 
management evaluates the adequacy of these reserves periodically based on forecasted sales and market trends 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the majority of receivables related to phototherapy sales are due from various distributors located outside of the united states and from physicians located inside the united states 
the majority of receivables related to skincare products and surgical products are due from various customers and distributors located inside the united states 
from time to time  our customers dispute the amounts due to us  and  in other cases  our customers experience financial difficulties and cannot pay on a timely basis 
in certain instances  these factors ultimately result in uncollectible accounts 
the determination of the appropriate reserve needed for uncollectible accounts involves significant judgment 
such factors include changes in the financial condition of our customers as a result of industry  economic or customer specific factors 
a change in the factors used to evaluate collectability could result in a significant change in the reserve needed 
property and equipment 
as of december  and  we had net property and equipment of  and  respectively 
the most significant component of these amounts relates to the xtrac lasers placed by us in physicians offices 
we own the equipment and charge the physician on a per treatment basis for use of the equipment 
the recoverability of the net carrying value of the lasers is predicated on continuing revenues from the physicians use of the lasers 
if the physician does not generate sufficient treatments  then we may remove the laser from the physician s office and redeploy elsewhere 
xtrac lasers placed in service are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of five years 
for other property and equipment  including property and equipment acquired from procyte  depreciation is calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets  primarily three to seven years for computer hardware and software  furniture and fixtures  automobiles  and machinery and equipment 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives or lease terms 
useful lives are determined based upon an estimate of either physical or economic obsolescence  or both 
goodwill and intangibles assets 
our balance sheet includes goodwill and other intangible assets which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we will incur 
management s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on various factors  including market conditions and operational performance of our business 
as of december  and  we had  and  respectively  of goodwill and other intangibles  accounting for and of our total assets at the respective dates 
the goodwill is not amortizable  the other intangibles are 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we test our goodwill for impairment  at least annually 
this test is usually conducted in december of each year in connection with the annual budgeting and forecast process 
also  on a quarterly basis  we evaluate whether events have occurred that would negatively impact the realizable value of our intangibles or goodwill 
we reorganized our business into four operating units which resulted in a change in reporting segments effective january  for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing  our reporting units are defined as physicians domestic  physicians international and other channels 
the balance of our goodwill for each of our segments as of december  is as follows physician domestic  physician international  and other channels  we completed our annual goodwill impairment analysis as of december  our assessment concluded that there was not any impairment of goodwill 
our analysis employed the use of both a market and income approach  with each method given equal weighting 
significant assumptions used in the income approach include growth and discount rates  margins and the company s weighted average cost of capital 
we used historical performance and management estimates of future performance to determine margins and growth rates 
discount rates selected for each reporting unit varied 
our weighted average cost of capital included a review and assessment of market and capital structure assumptions 
of the three reporting units with goodwill  physicians domestic has a fair value that is in excess of its carrying value by approximately  while physicians international has a fair value that is approximately in excess of its carrying value 
the third reporting unit  other channels has a fair value that is approximately in excess of its carrying value 
considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating changes and to estimate future cash flows 
changes in our actual results and or estimates or any of our other assumptions used in our analysis could result in a different conclusion 
in connection with the acquisition of photo therapeutics on february   we acquired certain intangibles recorded at fair value as of the date of acquisition and allocated them fully to the photo therapeutics segment 
the balances of these acquired intangibles  net of amortization  were december  ptl customer relationships ptl tradename ptl patented technologies goodwill total derivative financial instruments 
we recognize all derivative financial instruments as assets or liabilities in the financial statements and measures them at fair value with changes in fair value reflected as current period income or loss unless the derivatives qualify as hedges 
as a result  certain warrants are now accounted for as derivatives 
as of december  and  we had  and  respectively  in derivative financial instruments 
fair value measurements 
we measure fair value in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification  fair value measurements and disclosures asc topic 
asc topic defines fair value  establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability 
as a basis for considering such assumptions there exists a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
our derivative financial instruments are considered to be significant unobservable inputs level 
deferred income taxes 
we have a deferred tax asset that is fully reserved by a valuation allowance 
we have not recognized the deferred tax asset  given our historical losses and the lack of certainty of future taxable income 
however  if and when we become profitable and can reasonably foresee continuing profitability  then under fasb asc  income taxes asc topic we may recognize some of the deferred tax asset 
the recognized portion may variously reduce acquired goodwill  increase stockholders equity directly and or benefit the statement of operations 
warranty accruals 
we establish a liability for warranty repairs based on estimated future claims for xtrac systems and based on historical analysis of the cost of the repairs for surgical laser systems 
however  future returns of defective laser systems and related warranty liability could differ significantly from estimates  and historical patterns  which would adversely affect our operating results 
results of operations revenues the following table illustrates revenues from our four business segments for the periods listed below for the year ended december  physician domestic physician international other channels total dermatology revenues surgical products total revenues revenues from our surgical services segment  in the amount of  through august   the date of sale  have been accounted for in as a discontinued operation 
physician domestic segment the following table illustrates the key changes in the revenues of the physician domestic segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  xtrac treatments xtrac laser sales skincare products ptl products metvixia total physician domestic revenues xtrac treatments recognized treatment revenue for the years ended december    and was   and  respectively  reflecting billed procedures of   and  respectively 
in addition    and  procedures were performed for the years ended december   and  respectively  without billing from us  in connection with clinical research and customer evaluations of the xtrac laser 
increases in procedures are dependent upon building market acceptance through marketing programs with our physician partners and their patients that the xtrac procedures will be of clinical benefit and be generally reimbursed 
we have a program to support certain physicians who may be denied reimbursement by private insurance carriers for xtrac treatments 
we recognize service revenue during this program from the sale of xtrac procedures or equivalent treatments to physicians participating in this program only to the extent the physician has been reimbursed for the treatments 
in addition  we defer substantially all sales of treatment codes ordered by and delivered to the customer within the last two weeks of the period in determining the amount of procedures performed by our physician customers 
management believes this approach closely approximates the actual amount of unused treatments that existed at the end of a period 
for the year ended december   we recognized net revenues of  procedures and for the year ended december   we recognized net revenues of   procedures  respectively  under this approach 
for the year ended december   we deferred net revenues of   procedures under this approach 
the following table illustrates the above analysis for the domestic xtrac segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  recognized treatment revenue change in deferred treatment revenue net billed revenue procedure volume total less non billed procedures net billed procedures avg 
price of treatments billed change in procedures with deferred treatment revenue  net the average price for an xtrac treatment may be reduced in some instances based on the volume of treatments performed 
the average price for a treatment also varies based upon the mix of mild and moderate psoriasis patients treated by our physician partners 
we charge a higher price per treatment for moderate psoriasis patients due to the increased body surface area required to be treated  although there are fewer patients with moderate psoriasis than there are with mild psoriasis 
xtrac laser sales for the years ended december  and  domestic xtrac laser sales were  and  respectively 
there were and lasers sold  respectively 
there were xtrac lasers sold for the year ended december  for a total of  included in the year ended december  laser sales was a sale of one omnilux product from ptl for which we had been acting as a distributor in the united states 
we sell the laser directly to the customer for certain reasons  including the costs of logistical support and customer preference as well as a means of addressing under performing accounts while preserving the vendor customer relationship 
we believe that we are able to reach  at reasonable margins  a sector of the laser market that is better suited to a sale model than a per procedure  or consignment  model 
skincare products for the year ended december  revenues were  compared to  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
these revenues are generated from the sale of various skin  hair care and wound products to physicians in the domestic market 
we believe our skincare products are more susceptible to the macro economic conditions than our other products because cosmetic products are more likely to be discretionary and not medically necessary 
ptl products for the year ended december   ptl product revenues were  these revenues are generated from the sale of led devices 
there were led units sold during the year ended december  from the date of acquisition of photo therapeutics on february  through december   revenues from the ptl products were  representing led units 
there were no corresponding revenues for the year ended december  metvixia for the year ended december   metvixia revenues were  there were no corresponding revenues for the years ended december  and as the co promotion agreement with galderma began in january and concluded in december physician international segment the following table illustrates the key changes in the revenues of the physician international segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  international dermatology equipment skincare products ptl products total physician international revenues international dermatology equipment international sales of our xtrac and vtrac systems and related parts were  for the year ended december  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we sold systems in the year ended december  which compared to and systems in the years ended december  and  respectively 
the average price of dermatology equipment sold internationally varies due to the quantities of vtrac systems and refurbished domestic xtrac systems sold 
both of these products have lower average selling prices than new xtrac laser systems 
however  by adding these to our product offerings along with expanding into new geographic territories where the products are sold  we have been able to increase overall international dermatology equipment revenues 
we sold lasers to amico group  our distributor in the middle east  as part of the multi million dollar purchase order received in july we sold and lasers to amico group in the comparable years of and  respectively  and we also sell refurbished domestic xtrac laser systems into the international market 
the selling price for used equipment is substantially less than new equipment  some of which may be substantially depreciated in connection with its use in the domestic market 
we sold of these used lasers in the year ended december  at an average price of  we sold and of these used lasers  at an average price of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  and in addition to the xtrac laser system both new and used  we sell the vtrac  a lamp based alternative uvb light source that has a wholesale sales price that is below our competitors international dermatology equipment and below our xtrac laser 
we sold of these lasers in the year ended december  at an average price of  we sold and of these lasers  at an average price of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the following table illustrates the key changes in the international dermatology equipment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  revenues less part sales laser lamp revenues laser lamp systems sold average revenue per laser lamp international skincare products for the year ended december  revenues were  compared to  and  in the years ended december  and  respectively 
these revenues are generated from the sale of various skin  hair care and wound products to distributors in international markets 
we believe our skincare products are more susceptible to the macro economic conditions than our other products because cosmetic products are more likely to be discretionary and not medically necessary 
international ptl products these revenues are generated from the sale of led devices 
for the year ended december   ptl product revenues were  representing led units 
from the date of acquisition of photo therapeutics on february  through december   revenues from the ptl products were  representing led units 
there were no corresponding revenues for the year ended december the decline in ptl product revenues in the period described above was due to a large decrease in handheld unit sales as compared to the prior year periods 
in addition  the decrease in the year also resulted from the renegotiation of international distribution relationships and associated contracts  due to the transition of distributor management responsibilities to globalmed technologies  the company s master distributor 
other channels segment the following table illustrates the key changes in the revenues of the other channels segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  skincare products ptl products total other channels revenues skincare products for the year ended december  revenues from our skincare products were  compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these revenues are generated from the sale of various skin  hair care and wound and from the sale of copper peptide compound in non physician related channels 
included in the skincare product revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  from bulk compound sales  respectively 
there were no such sales in the year ended december  ptl products for the year ended december  ptl product revenues were  from the date of acquisition of photo therapeutics on february  through december   revenues from the ptl products were  ptl revenues are generated from the sale of led devices in the spa and indoor tanning markets and milestone payments on a licensing agreement targeting the mass consumer acne market 
there were no corresponding revenues for the year ended december included in the year ended december   there were milestone payments of  inasmuch as the licensee terminated the license in the quarter ended september   we do not anticipate further milestone payments 
there was no such milestone payments in the year ended december  we are actively seeking distribution channels to reach the home use consumer market with our clear u and new u hand held led devices 
surgical products segment the following table illustrates the key changes in our surgical products segment for the periods reflected below for the year ended december  revenues percent increase decrease laser systems sold laser system revenues average revenue per laser surgical products segment revenues include revenues derived from the sales of surgical laser systems together with sales of related laser fibers and laser disposables 
laser fibers and laser disposables are more profitable than laser systems  but the sales of laser systems generate subsequent recurring sales of fibers and disposables 
for the year ended december   surgical products revenues were  compared to  in the year ended december  the increase in the year was mainly due to the increase in laser sales 
offsetting the increase was a decrease in fiber and other disposables sales by with the comparable year ended december  we expect that our disposables base will continue to erode over time as hospitals continue to seek outsourcing solutions instead of purchasing lasers and related disposables for their operating rooms 
for the year ended december   surgical products revenues were  the decrease was mainly related to the termination of an oem contract in with angiodynamics 
sales to angiodynamics were million for the year ended december  the change in average price per laser between the periods  as set forth in the table below  was largely due to the mix of lasers sold and partly due to the trade level at which the lasers were sold ie wholesale versus retail 
our diode laser has replaced our nd yag laser  which had a substantially higher sales price 
included in laser sales during the years ended december   and were sales of  and diode lasers  respectively 
the diode lasers have lower sales prices than our other types of lasers 
during the year ended december   we sold our last six holmium laser systems  which completed the phase out of these laser systems 
cost of revenues all segments our cost of revenues is comprised of product cost of revenues and service cost of revenues 
within product cost of revenues are the costs of products sold in our physicians domestic segment with xtrac treatments included in the services side of the segment  physician international segment  other channels with royalties and licensing fees included in the services side of the segment  and our surgical products segment with laser maintenance fees included in the services side of this segment 
within services cost of revenues are the costs associated with our xtrac treatment revenues  as well as costs associated with royalties and licensing fees and maintenance revenue 
product cost of revenues during the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the  increase is due to the increases in laser sales for xtrac lasers in the international segment of  this increases in costs was offset in part by the relocation our skincare and ptl facilities into our pennsylvania facility  during  which allowed us to reduce some of the fixed costs 
product cost of revenues during the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the  decrease is due to decreases in product cost of sales for surgical products of  related to the decrease in laser sales  a decrease in skincare products of  resulting from the switch to our internally produced neova product and a decrease in domestic xtrac laser sales of  these decreases were partly offset  by an increase in international dermatology equipment sales in the amount of  in addition  there was an increase due to the inclusion of  in product costs for our ptl business 
services cost of revenues was  in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december   representing a decrease of  the decrease is directly related to the decrease in physician domestic segment costs of  related to our xtrac treatments 
services cost of revenues was  in the year ended december  compared to  in the year ended december   representing an increase of  the increase is directly related to the increase in our domestic xtrac segment costs of  certain allocable xtrac manufacturing overhead costs are charged against the xtrac service revenues 
our manufacturing facility in carlsbad  california is used exclusively for the production of the xtrac lasers 
the unabsorbed costs are allocated to the physician domestic and the physician international segments based on actual production of lasers for each segment 
included in these allocated manufacturing costs are unabsorbed labor and direct plant costs

the gross margin percentage for the vtrac is higher than for the xtrac 
revenues for the year ended december  included milestone payments to us from a licensee of  under a certain licensing arrangement for the clear u hand held device

the revenues for metvixia products of  for the year ended december  have no associated cost of sales 
there were no such revenues for the year ended december  the primary reasons for changes in gross profit and the gross margin percentage for the year ended december  compared to the same period in were as follows our skincare products are more susceptible to the macro economic conditions than our other products because cosmetic products are more likely to be discretionary and not medically necessary 
product sales for the year ended december  were approximately million down from approximately million for the year ended december  our skincare products margins are substantially higher than the other products and consequently substantive swings in the revenues attributed to skin care s sales will have a significant impact on our overall margins 
in our surgical products segment there were fewer laser systems sold in the year ended december  than in the comparable period of this included sales due to our oem arrangement  but in the second half of  angiodynamics elected out of the oem contract 
since that time  our sales to angiodynamics have been additionally  the higher manufacturing levels in caused better absorption of fixed overheads which lowered average unit costs and resulted in a higher gross margin in compared to we sold approximately  less in domestic xtrac lasers in the year ended december  than in the comparable period of in addition  the current year sales were at lower margins compared to the same period in certain of these lasers were previously being depreciated  since they were previously placements

beginning in  the various allocable manufacturing costs of the pennsylvania facility are allocated to surgical products  skincare and ptl products 
in prior years  these costs were allocated to surgical products only 
during we relocated our skincare and ptl facilities into our pennsylvania facility and are now able to spread these fixed costs over many product lines 
offsetting the above items that had a positive impact on gross profit  there was a decrease in sales of disposables between the periods  which have a higher gross margin as a percent of revenues than lasers

interest expense  net net interest expense for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the change in net interest expense was the result of the interest expense on the convertible debt which was issued on february  the following table illustrates the change in net interest expense december  december  change interest expense interest income net interest expense net interest expense for the year ended december  increased to  as compared to  for the year ended december  the change in net interest expense was the result of the interest expense on the convertible debt which was issued on february  the following table illustrates the change in net interest expense december  december  change interest expense interest income net interest expense change in fair value of warrants in accordance with fasb asc  debt debt with conversion and other options asc topic warrants issued in connection with the financing to acquire ptl were recorded at fair value and recognized as liabilities 
in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc topic  we measured the fair value of these warrants as of december   and recorded  for the year ended december   in other expense in recording the liabilities associated with these warrants at their fair value as of december  we measured the fair value of these warrants as of december   and recognized  for the year ended december   in other income in recording the liabilities associated with these warrants at their fair value as of december  net loss the factors discussed above resulted in a net loss of  during the year ended december   as compared to a net loss of  during the year ended december   a decrease of management utilizes certain non gaap financial measures to monitor our performance 
while we believe the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides additional insight into our operating performance  readers of this report are urged to review the gaap results as presented in the financial statements and supplementary data in item below 
we present a computation of non gaap adjusted net loss and non gaap adjusted loss per share 
we define non gaap adjusted net loss as net loss before depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation expense  severance costs  interest expense net  change in fair value of warrants  inventory valuation expense  bad debt expense  impairment on intangibles and other long lived assets and loss on sale of discontinued operations 
we believe that non gaap adjusted net loss is a meaningful measure which may be used when making period to period comparisons 
non gaap adjusted net loss is considered to be a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with net loss on the consolidated statement of operations 
we also present non gaap adjusted income loss per share which is derived by dividing non gaap adjusted income loss by the shares used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share 
non gaap adjusted income loss per share is considered to be a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with basic and diluted net loss per share on the consolidated statement of operations

the year ended december  included a loss on sale of discontinued operations of  the following table illustrates the impact of major expenses  namely depreciation  amortization  interest and stock option expense between the periods for the year ended december  change net loss components included in net loss depreciation and amortization stock based compensation expense interest expense  net change in fair value of warrants inventory valuation  severance and bad debt expenses impairment on intangibles and other long lived asset loss on sale of discontinued operations non gaap adjusted income loss shares used in computing basic and diluted net loss per share non gaap adjusted income loss per share income taxes were immaterial  given our current period losses and operating loss carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations with cash provided by equity financing and from lines of credit 
at december   our current ratio was compared to at december  as of december  we had  of working capital compared to  as of december  cash and cash equivalents were  as of december   as compared to  as of december  we had and  of cash that was classified as restricted as of december  and  respectively 
based on our resources available at december   including the public offering of our securities described below  and the substantial reduction in the use of cash in the last year  we believe that we can fund our operations through and beyond the first quarter of however  given the uncertainty in the general economic conditions and its impact on our business and industry  and in light of our historical operating losses and negative cash flows  there is no assurance that we will not require additional funds in order to continue as a going concern beyond the first quarter of we have restructured our operations and redirected our efforts in a manner that management believes will continue to improve results of operations 
as part of such redirected efforts  management continues comprehensive efforts to minimize our operational costs and capital expenditures and continues the implementation of strategies that were developed to increase ongoing revenue streams 
on october   we closed a private placement of our common shares with several accredited investors  which yielded gross proceeds of approximately million and which improved our available cash 
on november   we issued to an affiliate of one of the accredited investors participating in the october  private placement an additional  shares  which yielded additional gross proceeds of  although this financing  together with our other resources and arrangements with creditors  satisfied our immediate liquidity constraints at such time  we continue to explore additional opportunities to secure capital which might be used to continue to develop new business opportunities or  if necessary  to fund operations 
on march   we entered into the clutterbuck agreement the term note with clutterbuck funds 
we received net proceeds of  in the transaction 
the secured term note has a principal amount of million the term note  which accrues interest at a rate of per annum 
the term note requires us to make monthly payments of interest only 
the principal matures in months and may be prepaid without penalty at any time 
the term note is secured by xtrac lasers that we have consigned to physician customers and that are not otherwise pledged to cit healthcare llc and life sciences capital llc pursuant to our outstanding term notes with such lenders 
in connection with the issuance of the term note to clutterbuck  we issued clutterbuck funds a warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock for an initial exercise price of 
the warrant is exercisable at any time on or prior to the fifth anniversary of its issue date 
pursuant to the terms of the warrant  the exercise price is subject to a one time downward adjustment if we make certain issuances of our equity securities at a price per share less than during the month period following the issuance of the warrant 
in order to consummate the bridge financing  it was necessary to secure the consent of the holder of convertible notes 
as of march   the outstanding principal and accrued interest under the convertible notes was  in order to obtain the holder s consent  we agreed to the following modifications to the convertible notes we combined the aggregate outstanding obligations under the convertible notes into two convertible notes 
each note matures on february  and is identical to the original form of convertible note except as noted below  the larger note has a principal amount of  the note remains subject to the same down round anti provision adjustment to the conversion price which was in the unmodified notes 
the interest rate of this note was increased from to 
the incremental increase in the interest rate may be paid in cash  and may not be paid in convertible pik notes unless and until our stockholders vote to approve payment in the form of a convertible pik note  which the stockholders have done on october   the smaller note has a principal amount of  the conversion price of this note was reduced to and the down round anti dilution adjustment to the conversion price was removed 
the interest rate of this note was increased from to 
the full amount of the accrued interest remains payable in cash or convertible pik notes  the collateral securing the convertible note was expanded by adding a first priority lien against all of our assets other than the assets pledged with first priority liens to cit and to clutterbuck funds 
when assets are released from the lien of cit  such assets will become subject to the first priority lien of clutterbuck funds and a second priority lien of the investor 
finally  when assets are released from the lien of clutterbuck funds  such assets will become subject to the first priority lien of the investor  and three of our subsidiaries procyte corporation  photo therapeutics  inc and slt technology  inc 
have guaranteed our obligations under the modified convertible notes 
in conjunction with this  the conversion price of the larger convertible note and the exercise price of the warrants were adjusted by contract using a weighted average formula specified in the convertible note to have a conversion price and exercise price of per share for  and  respectively 
in conjunction with the may  public offering of our common stock  the larger convertible note and the warrant were adjusted by contract using a weighted average formula as specified in the convertible note to have conversion prices and exercise price of per share for  and  shares  respectively 
no change was made to the smaller note  as it has no down round provision 
interest at was paid on september  in the form of additional convertible notes of  and  for the series b convertible note and series b convertible note  respectively 
interest at was paid on march  in the form of additional convertible notes of  and  for the series b convertible note and series b convertible note  and the their related additional convertible notes  respectively 
on may   we closed on a public offering of our common shares

the sale resulted in net proceeds to us of approximately million 
the net proceeds will be used for general working capital purposes and potentially for pay down of outstanding debt 
the underwriters are also entitled to warrants to purchase  in aggregate   shares of our common stock at per share 
on march   clutterbuck funds agreed to extend the maturity date of its loan of to us  of which the principal of million was to be paid at maturity 
previously  the loan matured on september   it will now mature on december  starting in august  we will begin monthly installments of principal such that the final payment at maturity will be  to induce the modifications to the terms of its loan  we have issued to clutterbuck funds a second warrant which has been modeled after the first warrant issued on march  but which will be to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the collateral securing the first position security interest of clutterbuck funds and the second position security interest of the holder of our convertible notes will remain in place

the balance of the increase was mainly for the placement of lasers into service 
the placement of lasers into service is shown net of the remaining net book value of the lasers that we sold during the period presented 
when we retire a laser from service  we transfer the laser into inventory and then write off the net book value of the laser  which is typically negligible 
over the last few years the retirements of lasers from service have been minor or immaterial and  therefore  they are reported with placements on a net basis
