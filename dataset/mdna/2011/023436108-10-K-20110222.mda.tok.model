index to financial statements recent developments health care reform in march  president obama signed into law the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca and the health care and education reconciliation act of hcera  which amends the ppaca collectively  the health care reform bills 
the health care reform bills make a number of changes to medicare payment rates  including the reinstatement of the home health rural add on  which began on april  expiring january  
cms has recently made several changes to medicare home health payments for  as discussed below 
the health care reform bills also include a systemic rebasing of the amount cms reimburses for home health services  to be phased in over four years  beginning in we anticipate that many of the provisions of the health care reform bills may be subject to further clarification and modification through the rule making process 
it is uncertain at this time the effect the rebasing will have on our future results of operations or cash flows 
payment in november  cms issued a final rule to update and revise medicare home health rates for calendar year the final rule includes the following changes to the base rate a market basket increase which includes the reduction mandated by the health care reform bills  a negative case mix adjustment and a reduction to reflect the elimination of the increase in the base reimbursement rate resulting from the outlier cap introduced in the net effect of these changes decreases the base rate for by to  the change is effective for all episodes completing during  accordingly  all episodes in progress at december  were impacted 
as a result  our operating results include a reduction in revenue of million related to the rate change 
the rule also finalized two provisions of the ppaca a face to face encounter requirement for home health and hospice and changes in the therapy assessment schedule 
as a condition for medicare payment  the ppaca mandates that prior to certifying a patient s eligibility for the home health benefit  the certifying physician must document that he or she  or an allowed non physician practitioner  has had a face to face encounter with the patient 
the encounter must occur in the timeframe of days prior to the start of care or days after the start of care 
documentation regarding these encounters must be present on certifications 
the rule also finalized hospice policy for the implementation of a ppaca provision requiring that a hospice physician or nurse practitioner have a face to face encounter with hospice patients during the day period prior to the th day recertification third benefit period and each subsequent recertification  and that the certifying hospice physician attest that such a visit took place 
the face to face encounter requirement for home health and hospice providers was to become effective january  however  due to concerns that some providers may need additional time to establish operational protocols necessary to comply with face to face encounter requirements  cms delayed full enforcement of the requirements until the second quarter of beginning with the second quarter  cms will expect home health and hospice agencies to have fully established such internal processes and have appropriate documentation of required encounters 
in addition  the final rule imposed important therapy assessment requirements 
a professional qualified therapist assessment must take place at least once every days during a therapy patient s course of treatment 
for those qualified patients needing or therapy visits  a qualified therapist must perform the therapy service required  assess the patient  and measure and document effectiveness of the th visit and the th visit for all therapy disciplines caring for the patient 
cms delayed the effective date for all therapy provisions until april  to allow time for home health agencies to take necessary steps to comply

critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  collectibility of accounts receivable  reserves related to insurance and litigation  goodwill  intangible assets and contingencies 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results experienced may vary materially and adversely from our estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations may be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies represent our most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we earn net service revenue through our home health and hospice agencies by providing a variety of services almost exclusively in the homes of our patients 
this net service revenue is earned and billed either on an episode of care basis  on a per visit basis or on a daily basis depending upon the payment terms and conditions established with each payor for services provided 
we refer to home health revenue earned and billed on a day episode of care as episodic based revenue 
for the services we provide  medicare is our largest payor

index to financial statements when we record our service revenue  we record it net of estimated revenue adjustments and contractual adjustments to reflect amounts we estimate to be realizable for services provided  as discussed below 
we believe  based on information currently available to us and based on our judgment  that changes to one or more factors that impact the accounting estimates such as our estimates related to revenue adjustments  contractual adjustments and episodes in progress we make in determining net service revenue  which changes are likely to occur from period to period  will not materially impact our reported consolidated financial condition  results of operations  cash flows or our future financial results 
home health revenue recognition medicare revenue net service revenue is recorded under the medicare payment program pps based on a day episode payment rate that is subject to adjustment based on certain variables including  but not limited to a an outlier payment if our patient s care was unusually costly capped at of total reimbursement  b a low utilization payment adjustment lupa if the number of visits was fewer than five  c a partial payment if our patient transferred to another provider or we received a patient from another provider before completing the episode  d a payment adjustment based upon the level of therapy services required thresholds set at  and visits  e the number of episodes of care provided to a patient  regardless of whether the same home health provider provided care for the entire series of episodes  f changes in the base episode payments established by the medicare program  g adjustments to the base episode payments for case mix and geographic wages  and h recoveries of overpayments 
we make adjustments to medicare revenue on completed episodes to reflect differences between estimated and actual payment amounts  an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we estimate the impact of such adjustments based on our historical experience  which primarily includes a historical collection rate of over on medicare claims  and record this estimate during the period in which services are rendered as an estimated revenue adjustment and a corresponding reduction to patient accounts receivable 
therefore  we believe that our reported net service revenue and patient accounts receivable will be the amounts ultimately realized from medicare for services rendered 
in addition to revenue recognized on completed episodes  we also recognize a portion of revenue associated with episodes in progress 
episodes in progress are day episodes of care that begin during the reporting period  but were not completed as of the end of the period 
we estimate earned revenue on episodes in progress on a monthly basis based upon historical trends 
the primary factors underlying this estimate are the number of episodes in progress at the end of the reporting period  expected medicare revenue per episode and our estimate of the average percentage complete based on visits performed 
as of december  and  the difference between the cash received from medicare for a request for anticipated payment rap on episodes in progress and the associated estimated revenue was immaterial and therefore the resulting credits were recorded as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets for such periods 
non medicare revenue episodic based revenue 
we recognize revenue in a similar manner as we recognize medicare revenue for episodic based rates that are paid by other insurance carriers  including medicare advantage programs  however  these rates can vary based upon the negotiated terms 
non episodic based revenue 
gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established or estimated per visit rates  as applicable 
contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our standard rates and the contracted rates to be realized from patients  third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine net service revenue and are

in addition  we receive a minimal amount of our net service revenue from patients who are either self insured or are obligated for an insurance co payment 
hospice revenue recognition hospice medicare revenue gross revenue is recorded on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to the estimated payment rates based on a day episode of care basis for the first two hospice episodes of care and on a day episode of care basis for any subsequent hospice episodes 
the estimated payment rates are daily or hourly rates for each of the four levels of care we deliver 
the four main levels of care we provide are routine care  general inpatient care  continuous home care and respite care 
routine care accounts for  and of our net hospice medicare revenue for  and  respectively 
we make adjustments to medicare revenue for an inability to obtain appropriate billing documentation or authorizations acceptable to the payor and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
we estimate the impact of these adjustments based on our historical experience  which primarily includes our historical collection rate on medicare claims  and record it during the period services are rendered as an estimated revenue adjustment and as a reduction to our outstanding patient accounts receivable 
additionally  as medicare hospice revenue is subject to an inpatient cap limit and an overall payment cap  we monitor our provider numbers and estimate amounts refundable to medicare if a cap has been exceeded 
we record these adjustments as a reduction to revenue and an increase in other accrued liabilities 
as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  recorded for estimated amounts due back to medicare in other accrued liabilities in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
as a result of our adjustments  we believe our revenue and patients accounts receivable are recorded at amounts that will be ultimately realized 
hospice non medicare revenue we record gross revenue on an accrual basis based upon the date of service at amounts equal to our established rates or estimated per visit rates  as applicable 
contractual adjustments are recorded for the difference between our established rates and the amounts estimated to be realizable from patients  third parties and others for services provided and are deducted from gross revenue to determine our net service revenue and patient accounts receivable 
patient accounts receivable our patient accounts receivable are uncollateralized and consist of amounts due from medicare  medicaid  other third party payors and patients 
we believe there is a certain level of credit risk associated with non medicare payors 
to provide for our non medicare patient accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying amount to its estimated net realizable value 
we believe the credit risk associated with our medicare accounts  which represent and of our net patient accounts receivable at december  and  respectively  is limited due to i our historical collection rate of over from medicare and ii the fact that medicare is a us government payor 
accordingly  we do not record an allowance for doubtful accounts for our medicare patient accounts receivable  which are recorded at their net realizable value after recording estimated revenue adjustments as discussed above 
during  and  we recorded million  million and million  respectively  in estimated revenue adjustments to medicare revenue 
there is no single payor  other than medicare  that accounts for more than of our total outstanding patient receivables  and thus we believe there are no other significant concentrations of receivables that would subject us to any significant credit risk in the collection of our patient accounts receivable 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we fully reserve for accounts which are aged at days or greater 
we write off accounts on a monthly basis once we have exhausted our collection efforts and deem an account to be uncollectible 
medicare home health for our home health patients  our pre billing process includes verifying that we are eligible for payment from medicare for the services that we provide to our patients 
our medicare billing begins with a process to ensure that our billings are accurate through the utilization of an electronic medicare claim review 
we submit a rap for of our estimated payment for the initial episode at the start of care or of the estimated payment for any subsequent episodes of care contiguous with the first episode for a particular patient 
the full amount of the episode is billed after the episode has been completed final billed 
the rap received for that particular episode is then deducted from our final payment 
if a final bill is not submitted within the greater of days from the start of the episode  or days from the date the rap was paid  any raps received for that episode will be recouped by medicare from any other claims in process for that particular provider number 
the rap and final claim must then be re submitted 
medicare hospice for our hospice patients  our pre billing process includes verifying that we are eligible for payment from medicare for the services that we provide to our patients 
once each patient has been confirmed for eligibility  we will bill medicare on a monthly basis for the services provided to the patient 
non medicare home health and hospice for our non medicare patients  our pre billing process primarily begins with verifying a patient s eligibility for services with the applicable payor 
once the patient has been confirmed for eligibility  we will provide services to the patient and bill the applicable payor 
we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying amount of the receivables to the amounts we estimate will be ultimately collected 
our review and evaluation of non medicare accounts receivable includes a detailed review of outstanding balances and special consideration to concentrations of receivables from particular payors or groups of payors with similar characteristics that would subject us to any significant credit risk 
in addition  the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon our assessment of historical and expected net collections  business and economic conditions  trends in payment and an evaluation of collectibility based upon the date that the service was provided 
based upon our best judgment  we believe the allowance for doubtful accounts adequately provides for accounts that will not be collected due to credit risk 
insurance we are obligated for certain costs associated with our insurance programs  including employee health  workers compensation and professional liability 
while we maintain various insurance programs to cover these risks  we are self insured for a substantial portion of our potential claims 
we recognize our obligations associated with these costs in the period in which a claim is incurred  including with respect to both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported  up to specified deductible limits 
these costs have generally been estimated based on historical data of our claims experience 
such estimates  and the resulting reserves  are reviewed and updated by us on a quarterly basis 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to an annual impairment test 
tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
to determine whether goodwill is 
table of contents 
index to financial statements impaired  we perform a two step impairment test 
in the first step of the test  the fair values of the reporting units are compared to their aggregate carrying values  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered impaired and no further testing is required 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount  we would proceed to step two of the test 
in step two of the test  the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is determined by a hypothetical allocation of the fair value calculated in step one to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any recognized and unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was reflective of the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the excess  if any  of the calculated fair value after hypothetical allocation to the reporting unit s assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is greater than the carrying amount of the goodwill at the analysis date  goodwill is not impaired and the analysis is complete 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill at the analysis date  goodwill is deemed impaired by the amount of that variance 
we calculate the estimated fair value of our reporting units using discounted cash flows and an analysis of market capitalization 
to determine fair values we must make assumptions about a wide variety of internal and external factors 
significant assumptions used in the impairment analysis include financial projections of free cash flow including significant assumptions about operations  capital requirements and income taxes  long term growth rates for determining terminal value  and discount rates 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially adversely affect our future financial results 
these factors increase the risk of differences between projected and actual performance that could impact future estimates of fair value of all reporting units 
where available and appropriate  comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of our discounted cash flow test 
we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of october  and determined that no goodwill impairment existed as of october  although we believe that the financial projections used are reasonable and appropriate for all of our reporting units  there is uncertainty inherent in those projections 
as of december  we determined that no events or circumstances from october  through december  indicated that a further assessment was necessary 
intangible assets consist of certificates of need  licenses  acquired names  non compete agreements and reacquired franchise rights 
we amortize non compete agreements  acquired names that we do not intend to use in the future and reacquired franchise rights on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which is generally three years for non compete agreements and up to five years for reacquired franchise rights and acquired names 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach for measuring deferred tax assets and liabilities based on temporary differences existing at each balance sheet date using currently enacted tax rates 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about future operations 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the effect of a change in tax rate is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from fluctuations in interest rates 
our revolving credit facility and term loan carry a floating interest rate which is tied to the eurodollar rate ie libor and the prime rate and therefore  our consolidated statements of operations and our consolidated statements of cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the total amount of outstanding debt subject to interest rate fluctuations was million 
a interest rate change would cause interest expense to change by approximately million annually
