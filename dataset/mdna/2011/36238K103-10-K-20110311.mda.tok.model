item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis is provided to increase the understanding of  and should be read in conjunction with  our audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in part ii  item of this form k 
historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the consolidated financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future period 
we use the terms gtsi  company  we  our  and us to refer to gtsi corp 
and its subsidiaries 
overview gtsi has more than years of experience in selling it products and solutions primarily to us federal  state and local governments and to prime contractors who are working directly on government contracts 
we believe our key differentiators to be our strong brand among government customers  extensive contract portfolio  close relationships with wide variety of vendors  and a technology lifecycle management approach 
the it solutions we offer to our customers have a strong product component  along with a services component on many solutions 
we connect it s leading vendors  products and services inside the core technology areas most critical to government success by partnering with global it leaders such as cisco  microsoft  oracle  hewlett packard  panasonic  net app  dell  citrix and hitachi 
gtsi has strong strategic relationships with hardware and software industry leading oems and includes these products in the solutions we provide to our customers 
gtsi continues to develop and deliver information technology solutions that include products from oem partners in the areas of client end points  networking  data center and security 
gtsi will continue to enable said solutions through consulting  integration  delivery and support services 
to help our customers acquire  manage and refresh this technology in a strategic and application appropriate manner  gtsi has created a mix of professional and financial services capable of managing and funding the entire technology lifecycle 
additionally  gtsi offers leasing arrangements to allow government agencies to acquire access to technology on an evenly distributed operating expense basis  rather than on the much more budget sensitive and discontinuous capital expense basis 
we believe this model represents a distinctive advantage to our customers 
summarized below are some of the possible material trends  demands  commitments  events and uncertainties currently facing the company on october   gtsi received a notice from the small business administration sba that the sba was temporarily suspending gtsi from any future federal government contracting 
on october   gtsi entered into an administrative agreement with the sba lifting the temporary suspension the sba agreement 
in addition  gtsi entered into an amended credit agreement  dated october   with its lenders 
see our note commitments and contingencies in item and legal proceedings included in item  for a discussion of these matters 
while we are continuing to work to minimize the impact on our future business  the temporary suspension and sba agreement reduced sales and gross margin during the fourth quarter of during the three months ended december   the company recorded million of lease write offs as a result of the sba agreement and incurred additional sg a expenses of approximately million  million and million related to severance  legal  and monitoring and other expenses  respectively  in connection with the sba agreement 
if the company is unable to generate additional sales  mitigate impacted opportunities and reduce operating costs to offset for lost sales activity and added administrative costs related to the restrictions under the sba agreement it may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition in future periods 
the company expects to incur additional sg a expenses during the year ended december  related to legal  professional and monitoring and other expenses in connection with the sba agreement 

table of contents resolution of our continuing disputes with eyaktek and its other members may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance  as discussed in item legal proceedings 
while the outcome of these continuing disputes with eyaktek and its other members is currently unknown  possible outcomes may include a buyout of our equity interests in eyaktek  the dissolution of eyaktek  the continuation of eyaktek under its current operating agreement or under a modified operating agreement or some other alternative agreed upon by the various parties involved or ruled by the arbitrator 
the sale of our equity interest in eyaktek or eyaktek s dissolution would result in gtsi having no future equity income from eyaktek as reported in gtsi s consolidated statements of operations 
in the past  including for the years ended december   and  eyaktek s equity income has had a material positive impact on gtsi s financial performance 
we believe that gtsi s continuing disputes with eyaktek and its other members may have a material adverse affect on our financial performance 
during the year ended december   the company incurred legal fees of approximately million related to the various eyaktek legal matters and will continue to incur legal expenses until a resolution is reached 
we depend heavily on federal government contracts 
the federal government is currently operating under a continuing resolution that is effective through march   and its budget for has not been finalized 
a delay in the federal government budget process or a federal government shutdown may adversely affect our sales and gross margins  operating results and cash flows 
in the near term  we face some uncertainties due to the current business environment 
we have continued to experience a longer contracting process with dod agencies  which is one of our traditionally stronger markets 
this delay  along with an overall decrease in federal government it spending may have a negative impact on our financial condition  operating performance  revenue  income or liquidity 
a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support may cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts  to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or to decide not to exercise options to renew contracts 
with the sun oracle merger and the continued consolidation within the oem market place  we are likely to see continued pricing pressure from our partners in the market place 
the company s financial results for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by various government agencies spending trends  continued consolidation within the oem market place  competitive pricing pressures and weak sales activity in certain pockets of the hardware and software commodity segments  especially within the dod agencies 
during the year ended december   the company reviewed its various divisions and departments and whether to increase or decrease personnel as may be appropriate to support its operations 
the company  which had employees as of february   had employees at october  and employees as of february  the reduction of employees from february  to october   included hires  involuntary separations and voluntary separations 
since october   the reduction of employees included hires  involuntary separations and voluntary separations 
during the three months ended december   the higher than expected rate of voluntary separations of employees has resulted in some key openings within our sales organization and other positions within our organization 
we are actively recruiting for these positions to help minimize any impact on future revenue and results of operations 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded severance related costs  which are included in sg a expenses  of million and million  respectively 
as discussed in more detail below our sales decreased approximately million  or  from to  gross margin decreased million and gross margin as a percentage of sales decreased percentage points from to  in  sg a expenses decreased approximately million however sg a expenses as a percentage of sales increased of a percentage point from to  our net loss for the year ended december  was million  cash used in operations totaled million for the year ended december   
table of contents our business experiences significant fluctuations in our quarterly sales  operating income loss and net income loss as a result of the buying patterns of the federal government  our primary customer 
in  our results were positively affected by the reversal of the tax valuation allowance of million  which was recorded as an income tax benefit and increased our net income by million or an increase of per share 
for additional details  see the further md a discussion below 
we continue to evolve as a provider of value added infrastructure solutions that include both products and services to our government and system integrator customers 
we continue to identify and eliminate certain redundancies within the company and have terminated activities that have failed to yield adequate profitability 
while the larger it infrastructure solutions sales transactions represent a small percentage of our total transactions  they represent the majority of our margin and profits 
going forward  we will continue to focus on these larger  more profitable transactions  and drive processes and changes to make the delivery of the smaller transactions more profitable 
in addition  we will continue to take other actions to become a profitable company 
critical accounting estimates and policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting estimates are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have included below our policies that are both important to our financial condition and operating results  and require management s most subjective and complex judgments in determining the underlying estimates and assumptions 
the following list of critical accounting estimates and policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
accounting policies and estimates that management believes are most important to our financial condition and require management s significant judgments and estimates pertain to revenue recognition  transfer of receivables  valuation of inventory  capitalized internal use software  accounts payable and income taxes 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting estimates and policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the majority of our sales relates to physical products and is generally recognized when title and risk of loss to the products sold passes to the customer 
based on our standard shipping terms  title generally passes upon the customer s receipt of the products 
this requires us to analyze sales near the end of reporting periods to estimate the amount of products in transit to the customer that cannot be recognized as revenue 
many of our sales of physical products are shipped to our customers directly from our vendor partners 
the accurate recording of revenue for these transactions relies upon the accuracy of shipment dates we receive from our vendors and is subject to additional estimates and judgments by management 
in accordance with fasb asc  software revenue recognition  the company recognizes software related revenue from re selling third party software licenses that do not require significant production  modification or customization  when persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 

table of contents as discussed in note new accounting pronouncements  in item  effective january  the company adopted on a prospective basis for all new or materially modified arrangements entered into on or after january   the new accounting guidance for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and the new guidance related to the scope of existing software revenue recognition guidance 
the guidance does not generally change the units of accounting for the company s revenue transactions 
most of the company s products and services qualify as separate units of accounting 
the company is still evaluating the impact from this adoption and does not expect that it will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the company enters into revenue arrangements that may consist of multiple deliverables of its products and services based on the needs of its clients 
these arrangements may include any combination of hardware  software  services and or financing 
when a customer order contains multiple items such as hardware  software and services which are delivered at varying times  the company determines whether the delivered items can be considered separate units of accounting as prescribed under fasb asc  revenue recognition  multiple element arrangements asc 
asc states that delivered items should be considered separate units of accounting if delivered items have value to the customer on a standalone basis and if delivery of undelivered items is probable and substantially in gtsi s control 
generally  the company is able to establish fair value for all elements of the arrangement 
in these instances  revenue is recognized on each element separately 
however  if the delivered items do not have stand alone value to the customer without additional services provided  the company recognizes revenue on the contract as a single unit of accounting  based on either the completed contract or proportional performance methods as described below 
the company has allocated revenue from multiple element arrangements to the multiple elements based on the relative fair value of each element  which was generally based on the relative sales price of each element when sold separately 
we also offer lease and other financing arrangements to customers to acquire technology 
these arrangements typically have terms from two to four years and are generally accounted for as sales type leases under fasb asc  leases 
certain of our service and solution agreements require the evaluation of pattern of performance 
revenues on professional service contracts are generally recognized using the proportional performance basis of accounting 
for some professional services engagements the completed performance method is used when there are customer specified subjective acceptance criteria 
at the time of sale  we record an estimate for product returns based on historical experience 
management reviews the assumptions regarding the lag time and volume of sales returns at least on a quarterly basis  and changes in the estimates are recorded in the period in which they occur 
in accordance with fasb asc  revenue recognition  customer payments and incentives  we record vendor rebates received under our vendor incentive programs pursuant to a binding arrangement as a reduction of cost of sales based on a systematic and rational allocation that results in progress by the company toward earning the rebate provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
if the rebate is not probable and reasonably estimable  it is recognized as the milestones are achieved 
financing receivables we enter into complex agreements with our customers to provide it solutions with payment terms generally spread over a two to four year period 
usually we monetize these future revenue streams by selling such receivables to third party financial institutions 
we have master service agreements with multiple lenders each with varying terms 
these agreements  as well as the individual transaction agreements  require significant analysis to determine whether the transfer of the receivable should be accounted for as a sale or a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral based on fasb asc  transfers and servicing  criteria that requires gtsi to effectively surrender control over the asset 
the technical accounting and legal requirements involved are complex and subject to interpretation 
significant judgment is required to determine if we have effectively surrendered control over the asset 
if certain criteria are met and control is surrendered  the transaction is recorded as financing revenue and associated expenses as cost of sales 
if the transfer does not meet the criteria for a sale  the transaction is reported as a secured borrowing with pledge of collateral 
the collateral remains on our balance sheet and revenues and cost of sales are recognized over the term of the agreement 

table of contents stock based compensation effective january   we adopted fasb asc  compensation stock compensation  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payments on estimated fair values 
we adopted this standard using the modified prospective transition method 
inventory our inventory is stated at the lower of average cost or market value 
we reduce the value of our inventory for excess and obsolete inventory based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
in the future  if there were a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we would be required to increase our expense to write down inventory to market value and our gross margin may be adversely affected 
capitalized internal use software significant judgment is required to determine what expenditures qualify for capitalization of internal use software 
subsequent additions  modifications or upgrades to internal use software are capitalized only to the extent that they allow the software to perform a task that it previously did not perform 
capitalized internal use software is required to be tested for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
accounts payable we purchase significant amounts of inventory each year and record an estimate of the payable based on the purchases as of the balance sheet date 
for products shipped directly from our vendors to our customers  management makes estimates regarding the payable for shipped goods 
as invoices are received  we record adjustments for actual prices paid 
changes in our estimate of the payable balance may be caused by changes in price between the order date and the receipt date related to volume discounts  changes in market rates  or special pricing promotions offered by our vendors 
bids and proposals we amortize costs that are directly related to the acquisition of a long term contract and that would have not been incurred but for the acquisition of that contract incremental direct acquisition costs 
as long term contracts are awarded the related up front incentive costs  which are specific incremental costs associated with the acquisition of long term contracts  are recorded as prepaid deferred assets and amortized over the term of the contract or five years  whichever is shorter 
income taxes determining our effective tax rate  provision for tax expense  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the related valuation allowance involves judgments and estimates 
deferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the basis reported in our consolidated financial statements 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted rates expected to be in effect during the year in which the differences reverse 
valuation allowances are provided against assets  including net operating losses  if it is anticipated that the asset is not more likely than not to be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies 
we record reserves for uncertain tax positions  which management believes are adequate 
as of december   management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized and no valuation allowance is required 
in  management concluded that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized and released the full valuation allowance of million based on our pre tax book income of approximately million and management s projections of future profitability 
our effective tax rate in a given period may be impacted if we determine the allowance is or is not required  or if we were required to pay amounts in excess of established reserves
