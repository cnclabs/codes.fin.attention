item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that are based upon current expectations 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  believe  estimate  predict  intend  potential or continue or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology 
forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in our forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on the research  development  and commercialization of novel proprietary products for the acute treatment of central nervous system conditions 
all of our product candidates are based on our proprietary technology  the staccato system 
the staccato system vaporizes an excipient free drug to form a condensation aerosol that  when inhaled  allows for rapid systemic drug delivery 
because of the particle size of the aerosol  the drug is quickly absorbed through the deep lung into the bloodstream  providing speed of therapeutic onset that is comparable to intravenous  or iv  administration but with greater ease  patient comfort and convenience in january  we reduced the development of all of our product candidates  other than az staccato loxapine  our lead product candidate  in order to concentrate our efforts and resources on the clinical  regulatory  manufacturing and commercial development of az in december  we submitted our new drug application  or nda  for az in early  we conducted a thorough review of our product pipeline  evaluating current and potential new staccato based product candidates 
this review yielded three categories of staccato based product candidates product candidates where we believe we can add value through internal development  product candidates where we have developed the product idea  but where a development partner is required  and product candidates based on new ideas  primarily focused on new chemical entities  where the staccato technology can facilitate better or more effective delivery 
in july  we announced that  in addition to az  az staccato zaleplon and staccato nicotine would remain in active development 
active development on the remainder of our development pipeline is suspended 
we are continuing to seek partners to support development and commercialization of our product candidates 
we believe that our financial position as of december  will be sufficient to fund our operations  at our current cost levels  into the third quarter of we are unable to assert that our financial position is sufficient to fund operations beyond that date  and as a result  there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we may not be able to raise sufficient capital on acceptable terms  or at all  to continue development of az or to continue operations  and we may not be able to execute any strategic transaction 
lead product update our lead product candidate is az  which is being developed for the rapid treatment of agitation in patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder 
in december  we filed an nda for our az product candidate  submitted as adasuve tm staccato loxapine inhalation aerosol  mg and mg 
in october  we received a complete response letter  or crl  from the us food and drug administration  or fda  regarding our nda for az a crl is issued by the fda indicating that the nda review cycle is complete and the application is not ready for approval in its present form 
in december  we completed an end of review meeting with the fda to discuss the issues outlined in the az crl 
in january  we received the official fda minutes of the meeting  and we anticipate resubmitting the az nda in july we are seeking commercial partners for the worldwide development and commercialization of az in the crl  the fda stated that its primary clinical safety concern was related to data from the three phase pulmonary safety studies with az this concern was primarily based on observed  dose related post dose decreases in forced expiratory volume in one second  or fev  a standard measure of lung function  in healthy subjects and in subjects with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd  and asthma 
the fda also noted that decreases in fev were recorded in subjects who were administered device only  placebo versions of az 
table of contents in the information package submitted to the fda in response to the crl and in preparation for the end of review meeting  we presented evidence that we believe demonstrates the placebo device is safe  including a blinded expert review of the flow volume loops data from the healthy subject study as further evidence that there appears to be no consistent pattern suggestive of airway obstruction in these subjects 
we also provided an analysis that we believe shows that there is no meaningful temporal relationship between placebo administration and decreases in fev we believe this evidence and analysis confirm that the changes seen were likely background events in the population studied  where the repeated and extensive pulmonary function testing may have contributed to some of the observations 
additionally  we believe we showed that the aerosol characterization does not indicate a basis for concern 
we agreed to reiterate these arguments in our nda resubmission 
in the information package  we also believe we showed that the pulmonary safety program in subjects with asthma and copd had identified patients who may be susceptible to bronchospasm  the nature of this adverse event  how it can be managed  and that we believe the risk in these patients could be mitigated through labeling and a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy  or rems program 
at the end of review meeting  the fda stated that it would be reasonable to propose a rems program for the use of staccato loxapine  and requested that as part of our resubmission  we provide a detailed rems proposal including labeling  a medication guide and a communication plan  to manage the potential risks 
in the resubmission we must also show how to identify patients at risk of developing pulmonary side effects  as well as a way to decide who should and should not be treated with staccato loxapine when they present for treatment 
the fda also informed us that it would likely present the nda to an advisory committee 
the crl also raised issues relating to the suitability of our stability studies and certain other chemistry  manufacturing and controls  or cmc  concerns  including items relating to the fda s pre approval manufacturing inspection 
because az incorporates a novel delivery system  the crl also included input from the fda s center for devices and radiological health  or the cdrh 
in the crl the cdrh requested a human factors study and related analysis to validate that the product can be used effectively in the proposed clinical setting 
we expect to finalize the protocol with the fda and complete this study in the coming months 
we are not currently required to conduct any additional efficacy or safety clinical trials for az the cdrh also requested further bench testing of the product under an additional worst case manufacturing scenario 
we have completed this additional worst case bench testing of the product  submitted the data to the fda and believe that this issue has been adequately addressed 
in february  we entered into a collaboration and license agreement  or license agreement  and a manufacture and supply agreement  collectively  the collaboration  with biovail laboratories international srl  or biovail  for az for the treatment of psychiatric and or neurological indications and the symptoms associated with these indications  including the initial indication of treating agitation in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder patients 
on october   biovail notified us of its intention to terminate the collaboration 
upon the termination  we reacquired the us and canadian rights to az and have worldwide rights 
neither alexza nor biovail incurred any early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the collaboration 
financing update in december  we entered into a transaction involving a series of related agreements providing for the financing of additional clinical and nonclinical development of az  staccato alprazolam  and az az  staccato loxapine 
pursuant to the agreements  symphony capital llc and other investors  whom we refer to collectively as the allegro investors  invested million to form symphony allegro  inc  or symphony allegro  to fund additional clinical and nonclinical development of staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine 
we exclusively licensed to symphony allegro certain intellectual property rights related to staccato alprazolam and staccato loxapine 
we retained manufacturing rights to these product candidates 
in august  we completed the acquisition of symphony allegro through the exercise of an option to acquire all of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro  as amended in june in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of symphony allegro  we i issued to the allegro investors million shares of common stock  ii issued to the allegro investors year warrants to purchase million shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share and canceled the previously outstanding warrants to purchase million shares of common stock held by the allegro investors  and iii agreed to pay certain percentages of cash payments that may be generated from future partnering 
table of contents transactions for az  az and or az  the product candidates that were licensed to symphony allegro 
in february  we paid the allegro investors million of the total proceeds that were received from biovail pursuant to the collaboration 
in addition  the allegro investors will be entitled to receive a portion of future milestone and royalty payments we may receive for az  az  and or az in may  we entered into a loan and security agreement  or loan agreement  with hercules technology growth capital  inc  or hercules 
under the terms of the loan agreement  we have borrowed  at an interest rate of the higher of i or ii plus the prime rate as reported in the wall street journal  with a maximum interest rate of  and issued to hercules a secured term promissory note evidencing the loan 
we made interest only payments for the initial eight months  following which the loan will be repaid in equal monthly installments 
the loan agreement limits both the seniority and amount of future debt we may incur 
we may be required to repay the loan in the event of a change in control 
in conjunction with the loan  we issued to hercules a five year warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the warrant is immediately exercisable and expires five years from the effective date 
we estimated the fair value of this warrant as of the issuance date to be  which was recorded as a debt discount to the loan and consequently a reduction to the carrying value of the loan 
the fair value of the warrant was calculated using the black scholes option valuation model  and was based on the contractual term of the warrant of five years  a risk free interest rate of  expected volatility of and expected dividend yield 
we also recorded fees paid to hercules as a debt discount which further reduced the carrying value of the loan 
the debt discount is being amortized to interest expense 
in may  we obtained a committed equity financing facility under which we may sell up to  shares of common stock to azimuth opportunity  ltd  or azimuth  over a month period 
we are not obligated to utilize any of the facility and we remain free to enter into and consummate other equity and debt financing transactions 
we will determine  at our sole discretion  the timing  the dollar amount and the price per share of each draw under this facility  subject to certain conditions 
when and if we elect to use the facility  we will issue shares to azimuth at a discount between and to the volume weighted average price of our common stock over a preceding period of trading days 
azimuth is not required to purchase any shares at a pre discounted purchase price below per share 
any shares sold under this facility will be sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on may  this facility replaces a similar facility that was established in march and expired after its month term 
as of december   there have been no sales of common stock under either of these facilities 
in august  we completed a registered direct offering of our common stock and warrants 
we sold a total of  units  each unit consisting of i one share of common stock and ii one warrant to purchase of a share of common stock  at a purchase price of per unit 
the warrants are exercisable six months after issuance at per share and expire five years from the date of issuance 
net proceeds from the offering were approximately million  after deducting placement agents commissions and offering expenses 
the securities were sold pursuant to a shelf registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission on may  other than those licensed to cypress biosciences  inc  or cypress  for our staccato nicotine product candidate  we have retained all rights to our product candidates and the staccato system 
we intend to capitalize on our internal resources to develop certain product candidates and to identify routes to utilize external resources to develop and commercialize other product candidates 
we were incorporated december  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities  capital lease and equipment financings  debt financings and government grants 
we have generated million in revenues from inception through december   primarily through license and development agreements and to a lesser extent united states small business innovation research grants and drug compound feasibility studies 
prior to  we recognized governmental grant revenue and drug compound feasibility revenue  however  we expect no grant revenue or drug compound feasibility screening revenue in we do not expect any material product revenue until at least we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our deficit accumulated during development stage was million and total stockholders equity was million 
we recognized net 
table of contents losses of million  million  million in  and  respectively  and million in the period from december  inception to december  in january  we consolidated our operations to primarily focus our efforts on the continued rapid development of az we expect our net losses to increase in compared to  as the results were impacted by the revenue recognized from biovail s termination of the license agreement 
the process of conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials necessary to obtain fda approval is costly and time consuming 
we consider the development of our product candidates to be crucial to our long term success 
if we do not complete development of our product candidates and obtain regulatory approval to market one or more of these product candidates  we may be forced to cease operations 
the probability of success for each product candidate may be impacted by numerous factors  including preclinical data  clinical data  competition  device development  manufacturing capability  regulatory approval and commercial viability 
our strategy is to focus our resources on az in addition  we plan to seek commercial partners for the worldwide development and commercialization for all of our product candidates 
if in the future we enter into additional partnerships  third parties could have control over preclinical development or clinical trials for some of our product candidates 
accordingly  the progress of such product candidate would not be under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates  if any  will be subject to any future partnerships or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  the uncertainty associated with clinical trial enrollments  and the risks inherent in the development process  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of the current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when  or to what extent  we will generate revenues from the commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
development timelines  probability of success and development costs vary widely 
while we are currently focused on developing our product candidates  we anticipate that we and our partners  will make determinations as to which programs to pursue and how much funding to direct to each program on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate  as well as an ongoing assessment as to the product candidate s commercial potential 
we do not expect any of our current product candidates to be commercially available before  if at all 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments related to development costs 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making assumptions about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the process of making significant estimates and judgments in preparation of our financial statements 
preclinical study and clinical trial accruals we estimate our preclinical study and clinical trial expenses based on our estimates of the services received pursuant to contracts with multiple research institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage preclinical studies and clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
preclinical study and clinical trial expenses include the following fees paid to contract research organizations in connection with preclinical studies  fees paid to contract research organizations and other clinical sites in connection with clinical trials  and 
table of contents fees paid to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of components and drug materials for preclinical studies and clinical trials 
we record accruals for these preclinical study and clinical trial costs based upon the estimated amount of work completed 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses based on these estimates 
costs related to patient enrollment in clinical trials are accrued as patients are entered in the trial 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence and discussions with research institutions and organizations 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate or overestimate activity levels associated with various preclinical studies and clinical trials at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record significant research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
to date  we have not made any material adjustments to our estimates of preclinical study and clinical trial costs 
we make good faith estimates which we believe to be accurate  but the actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain  subject to risk and may change depending upon a number of factors  including our clinical development plan 
share based compensation we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and purchase rights issued under our employee stock purchase plan 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates and expected dividends 
the estimated fair value of restricted stock unit awards is calculated based on the market price of our common stock on the date of grant  reduced by the present value of dividends expected to be paid on our common stock prior to vesting of the restricted stock unit 
our current estimate assumes no dividends will be paid prior to the vesting of the restricted stock unit 
we estimate the expected term of options based on the historical term periods of options that have been granted but are no longer outstanding and the estimated terms of outstanding options 
we estimate the volatility of our stock based on our actual historical volatility since our initial public offering 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating share based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the expenses in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating loss  net loss and net loss per share 
contingent consideration liability in august  we completed our purchase of all of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro  and in exchange we i issued to the allegro investors million shares of our common stock  ii issued to the allegro investors year warrants to purchase five million shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share  and iii will pay to the allegro investors certain percentages of cash payments that may be generated from future partnering transactions pertaining to az staccato loxapine or az staccato alprazolam 
we estimate the fair value of the liability associated with the contingent cash payments to the allegro investors  or contingent consideration liability  on a quarterly basis using a probability weighted discounted cash 
table of contents flow model 
we derive multiple cash flow scenarios for each of the product candidates subject to the cash payments and apply a probability to each of the scenarios 
these probability and risk adjusted weighted average cash flows are then discounted utilizing our estimated weighted average cost of capital  or wacc 
our wacc considers our cash position  competition  risk of substitute products  and risk associated with the financing of the development projects 
we determined the discount rate to be and applied this rate to the probability adjusted cash flow scenarios 
we record any changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration liability in earnings in the period of the change 
certain events including  but not limited to  clinical trial results  fda approval or non approval of our submissions  the timing and terms of any strategic partnership agreement  the commercial success of az  az or az and the discount rate assumption could have a material impact on the fair value of the contingent consideration liability  and as a result  our results of operations and financial position 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin  sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by staff accounting bulletin no 
 revision of topic in determining the accounting for collaboration agreements  we determine whether an arrangement involves multiple revenue generating deliverables that should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting or divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes and  if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the arrangement represents a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy and the performance obligation period must be determined  if not already contractually defined  for the entire arrangement 
if the arrangement represents separate units of accounting  a revenue recognition policy must be determined for each unit 
revenues for non refundable upfront license fee payments  where we continue to have obligations  will be recognized as performance occurs and obligations are completed 
recently issued accounting standards in october  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  published accounting standards update  or asu   which amends the criteria to identify separate units of accounting within subtopic  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the revised guidance eliminates the residual method of allocation  and instead requires companies to use the relative selling price method when allocating revenue in a multiple deliverable arrangement 
when applying the relative selling price method  the selling price for each deliverable shall be determined using vendor specific objective evidence of selling price  if it exists  otherwise using third party evidence of selling price 
if neither vendor specific objective evidence nor third party evidence of selling price exists for a deliverable  companies shall use their best estimate of the selling price for that deliverable when applying the relative selling price method 
the adoption of asu will only affect multiple deliverable arrangements entered into after january  we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  the adoption of this guidance on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued asu  milestone method of revenue recognition a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force 
fasb asu provides guidance on defining a milestone and determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research and development transactions 
a vendor can recognize consideration in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
additional disclosures describing the consideration arrangement and the entity s accounting policy for recognition of such milestone payments are also required 
fasb asu is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within such fiscal years  beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
the guidance may be applied prospectively to milestones achieved during the period of adoption or retrospectively for all prior periods 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of this guidance on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december  and and revenue 
we had   and  of revenues in  and  respectively 
revenues in consisted of revenues related to our license and development agreement  or endo license agreement  with endo pharmaceuticals  inc  or endo 
in january  we mutually agreed with endo to terminate the endo license agreement  at which time we fulfilled our obligations under the endo license agreement and recognized the remaining million of deferred revenues into revenues in in february we entered into a license and development agreement with biovail in which we received an upfront payment of million 
in october  biovail gave notification of its intention to terminate the collaboration  at which time we recognized the upfront payment as revenues as we had fulfilled our obligations under the collaboration 
in  we also recognized million from our license and development agreement  or cypress agreement  with cypress and  of grant revenues from the us government s qualified therapeutic development program 
we expect a decrease in revenues as a result of the recognition of the entirety of the revenues from biovail in and as we do not anticipate any grant revenues 
operating expenses research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist of costs associated with research activities  as well as costs associated with our product development efforts  conducting preclinical studies and clinical trials and manufacturing development efforts 
all research and development costs  including those funded by third parties  are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses include external research and development expenses incurred under agreements with third party contract research organizations and investigational sites where a substantial portion of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials are conducted  third party supplier  consultant and employee related expenses  which include salary and benefits  and facilities  depreciation and other allocated expenses  which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities  depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and laboratory and other supplies 
the table below sets forth our research and development expenses for  and broken out between product candidate and general research expenses based on our internal records and estimated allocations of employee time and related expenses year ended december  product candidate expenses general research total research and development research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in years ended december   and  respectively 
in january  we restructured our operations  including an approximate reduction in headcount  to focus our efforts on the continued rapid development of our az staccato loxapine product candidate 
the restructuring of our operations resulted in a decrease in both product candidate and general research expenses in and as compared to prior periods as work wound down or halted for our non az product candidates 
this emphasis on the rapid development of az resulted in az accounting for of product candidate expenses in the year ended december  as compared to in and in in july  we announced that we moved az into active development and began preliminary work on az in preparation for the phase clinical trials 
however  due to the fda not approving az for commercial marketing in october  we are slowing the clinical development of az we expect that research and development expenses will remain relatively consistent with levels 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive  finance  accounting  business development  legal and human resources functions 
other general and administrative expenses include facility and information technology costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses  patent related costs and professional fees for legal  consulting and accounting services 
the decreases in general and administrative expenses were primarily due to decreased headcount expenses as a result of our restructuring in january  reduced facility expenses as we completed our move to our mountain view facility in the first half of  and our efforts to reduce third party costs to conserve cash balances 
the decrease in share based compensation in of million as compared to was a result of lower expense related to the share based awards issued under the performance based incentive program as vesting milestones were not met and previously issued share based awards became fully vested during the year 
we expect our non share based compensation and general and administrative expenses in to remain relatively consistent with levels 
restructuring charges in january  we restructured our operations to focus our efforts on the continued rapid development of our az staccato loxapine product candidate 
the restructuring included a workforce reduction of employees  representing approximately of our total workforce and was completed in the second quarter of we incurred restructuring expenses related to employee severance and other termination benefits of million  including a non cash charge related to modifications to share based awards of  the restructuring was completed in interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  primarily represents income earned on our cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities balances  and prior to august   marketable securities held by symphony allegro 
interest and other income  net was   and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the income was impacted by a loss on retirements of fixed assets of  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower average cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances and lower interest rates earned on such balances 
we expect to continue to earn low interest income returns on our cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
interest expense 
interest expense represents interest on our equipment loans and financing obligations and was million   and  in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in as compared to was primarily due to the interest incurred on the million note issued to hercules in may the decrease in from was due to decreases in the outstanding balances of our equipment loan borrowings as we made no additional borrowings in or change in the fair value of contingent consideration liability 
in connection with our acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro  we are obligated to pay the allegro investors certain percentages of cash payments that may be generated from future partnering transactions for az  az and or az we measure the fair value of this contingent consideration liability at each balance sheet date 
any changes in the fair value of this contingent consideration liability will be recognized in earnings in the period of the change 
certain events including  but not limited to  clinical trial results  fda approval or non approval of our submissions  the timing and terms of strategic partnerships  the commercial success of az  az and or az and the discount rate assumption could have a material impact on the fair value of the contingent liability  and as a result  our results of operations 
in october  we received a crl from the fda for our az nda submitted in december and held a meeting with the fda in december to address the issues outlined in the crl 
as a result of the crl and the meeting with the fda  we reduced the weighted average expected cash flows for milestone payments and product royalties  and the timing of those cash flows  for az the reduction of the expected cash flows and timing of these cash flows resulted in a reduction in the net present value of estimated future payments to symphony allegro 
we recognized a gain of million to reflect the reduction in the contingent consideration liability during the year ended december  
table of contents in  we announced preliminary results from our phase b clinical trial of az  where az did not meet the primary endpoint of the study 
this change resulted in a decrease in the expected cash flow resulting in a decrease in the contingent consideration liability 
in the fourth quarter of  we modified our assumptions regarding the probability of certain cash flow outcomes to reflect the negotiations with biovail to partner az as well as the filing of our nda 
the reduction in these uncertainties resulted in an increase in probability of certain cash flows resulting in an increase in the contingent consideration liability 
these items combined resulted in our incurring a loss on the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability of million during the year ended december  loss attributed to noncontrolling interest in symphony allegro 
prior to our purchase of symphony allegro on august   we consolidated symphony allegro s financial condition and results of operations 
accordingly  we deducted the losses attributable to the noncontrolling interest from our net loss in the consolidated statement of operations  and we reduced the noncontrolling interest holders ownership interest in symphony allegro in the consolidated balance sheet by the loss attributed to the noncontrolling interests in symphony allegro 
the losses attributed to the noncontrolling interest holders was million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to a full year of symphony allegro s losses being attributed to the noncontrolling interest in as compared to approximately months in as a result of our acquisition of all of the outstanding equity of symphony allegro in august liquidity and capital resources since inception  we have financed our operations primarily through private placements and public offerings of equity securities  revenues primarily from a licensing agreement and government grants  and payments from symphony allegro 
we have received additional funding from financing obligations  interest earned on investments  as described below  and funds received upon exercises of stock options and exercises of purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
our cash and marketable security balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  including obligations of united states government agencies  high credit rating corporate borrowers and money market accounts 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity  capital preservation and yield 
net cash provided by used in operating activities was million  million  and million  in  and  respectively 
the net cash provided by or used in each of these periods primarily reflects net loss for these periods  offset in part by depreciation  non cash stock based compensation  the change in fair value of the contingent consideration liability  loss attributed to noncontrolling interests  and non cash changes in operating assets and liabilities 
in  the deferred revenue balance resulted from upfront fees paid by cypress as required by the cypress agreement signed in the increase in other assets in was a result of the deposit of million with autoliv 
the decrease in other receivables in was a result of the collection of fees paid to the fda upon our submission of our nda in our designation as a small business resulted in our exclusion from such fees and the amount was refunded in in  the decrease in deferred revenue was related to the mutual termination of our license agreement with endo  at which time we recognized the remaining million of deferred revenue 
the decreases in accounts payable of million in and accrued clinical trial expense and other accrued liabilities of million was due to the decreased activity in our operations 
in  the large decrease in other receivables was due to the collection of a receivable of million from endo in january related to the license agreement signed in december and a million receivable related to the reimbursement of leasehold improvements from the landlord of our mountain view facility in may net cash provided by used in investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
investing activities consist primarily of purchases and maturities of marketable securities and capital purchases 
during we purchased million of marketable securities  net of maturities 
during and we had maturities  net of purchases  of marketable securities of million and million  respectively 
maturities of marketable securities held by symphony allegro were million and million in and  respectively 
purchases of property and equipment were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  the purchases primarily consisted of manufacturing equipment as we prepared for the expected commercialization of az 
table of contents net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
financing activities consist primarily of proceeds from the sale of our common stock  purchase of a noncontrolling interest  equipment financing arrangements and financing obligations 
in  and  we received net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of million  million and million  respectively 
in we had proceeds from the purchase of the noncontrolling interest in symphony allegro of million 
in  we had proceeds from debt borrowings  net of payments  of million  while in and  payments on debt were million and million  respectively 
we believe that with current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities along with interest earned thereon  the proceeds from option exercises and purchases of common stock pursuant to our employee stock purchase plan  we will be able to maintain our current operations  at our current cost levels  into the third quarter of changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate or to alter our operations 
we have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available financial resources sooner than we currently expect 
the key assumptions underlying these estimates include expenditures related to continued preclinical and clinical development of our lead product candidates during this period within budgeted levels  no unexpected costs related to the development of our manufacturing capability  and no growth in the number of our employees during this period 
our forecast of the period of time that our financial resources will be adequate to support operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors  including the factors discussed in risk factors 
in light of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of our product candidates and the extent to which we enter into strategic partnerships with third parties to participate in their development and commercialization  we are unable to estimate the amounts of increased capital outlays and operating expenditures associated with our current and anticipated clinical trials 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope  rate of progress  results and costs of our preclinical studies  clinical trials and other research and development activities  the terms and timing of any distribution  strategic partnerships or licensing agreements that we may establish  the cost  timing and outcomes of regulatory approvals  the number and characteristics of product candidates that we pursue  the cost and timing of establishing manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the cost of preparing  filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies  although we currently have no commitments or agreements relating to any of these types of transactions 
we will need to raise additional funds to support our operations  and such funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
in this regard  we received an explanatory paragraph from our independent registered public accounting firm in their audit opinion raising substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when needed  we may not be able to continue development of our product candidates or we could be required to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs  reduce our efforts to build our commercial manufacturing capacity  and other operations 
we may seek to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic partnerships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
if we raise funds through collaborative or licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish  on 
table of contents terms that are not favorable to us  rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves 
our failure to raise capital when needed may harm our business  financial condition  results of operations  and prospects 
contractual obligations we lease two buildings with an aggregate of  square feet of manufacturing  office and laboratory facilities in mountain view  california  which we began to occupy in the fourth quarter of we currently have subleases covering  square feet   square feet and  square feet of these facilities  reducing the space we occupy to  square feet 
the lease for both facilities expires on march   and we have two options to extend the lease for five years each 
our sublease agreements expire on april  with regards to  square feet  on february  with regards to  square feet and on august  with regards to  square feet 
we believe that the mountain view facilities are sufficient for our office  manufacturing and laboratory needs for at least the next three years 
we have financed a portion of our equipment purchases through various equipment financing agreements 
under the agreements  equipment advances are to be repaid in to monthly installments of principal and interest 
the interest rate  which is fixed for each draw  is based on the us treasuries of comparable maturities and ranges from to 
the equipment purchased under the equipment financing agreement is pledged as security 
on may   we entered into the loan agreement with hercules 
under the terms of the loan agreement  we have borrowed  at an interest rate equal to the higher of i or ii plus the prime rate as reported in the wall street journal  with a maximum interest rate of  and issued to hercules a secured term promissory note evidencing the loan 
we made interest only payments for the initial eight months following which the loan will be repaid in equal monthly installments 
on november   we entered into a manufacturing and supply agreement  or the manufacture agreement  with autoliv asp  inc  or autoliv  relating to the commercial supply of chemical heat packages that can be incorporated into our staccato device 
autoliv had developed these chemical heat packages for us pursuant to a development agreement between autoliv and us executed in october in june and february  we entered into agreements to amend the terms of the manufacture agreement  or the amendments 
under the terms of the first of the amendments  we paid autoliv million and issued autoliv a million unsecured promissory note in return for a production line for the commercial manufacture of chemical heat packages 
each production line is comprised of two identical and self sustaining cells  and the first such cell was completed  installed and qualified in connection with such amendment 
under the terms of the second of the amendments  the original million note was cancelled and a new unsecured promissory note was issued with a reduced principal amount of million  or the second note  and production on the second cell ceased 
the second note is payable in equal monthly installments of approximately  and we have paid the first two such installments 
in the event that we request completion of the second cell of the first production line for the commercial manufacture of chemical heat packages  autoliv will complete  install and fully qualify such second cell for a cost to us of million and autoliv will transfer ownership of such cell to us upon the payment in full of such million and the second note 
at our request  autoliv will manufacture up to two additional production lines for the commercial manufacture of chemical heat packages at a cost not to exceed  for each additional line 
we will pay autoliv a specified purchase price  which varies based on annual quantities ordered by us  per chemical heat package delivered 
the initial term of the manufacture agreement expires on december   at which time the manufacture agreement will automatically renew for successive five year renewal terms unless we or autoliv notify the other party no less than months prior to the end of the initial term or the then current renewal term that such party wishes to terminate the manufacture agreement 
our recurring losses from operations and our need for additional capital raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern  and as a result  we have classified all of our financing obligations as current 
if this substantial doubt is removed in future periods  we will reclassify these financing obligations between current 
table of contents and non current 
our future contractual payments  net of sublease income  including interest at december  are as follows in thousands payments due by period less than total year years years thereafter equipment financing obligations operating lease obligations term note obligations off balance sheet arrangements none

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents  which have maturities of less than three months  and marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations 
we also seek to maximize income from our investments without assuming significant risk 
to achieve our objectives  we maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities of high credit quality 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged  are classified as available for sale and are  due to their very short term nature  subject to minimal interest rate risk 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
because of the short term maturities of our investments  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have a material negative impact on the realized value of our investment portfolio 
we actively monitor changes in interest rates 
we perform quarterly reviews of our investment portfolio and believe we have no exposure related to mortgage and other asset backed securities and no exposure to auction rate securities
