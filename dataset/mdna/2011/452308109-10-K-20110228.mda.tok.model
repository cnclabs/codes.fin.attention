item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction illinois tool works inc the company or itw is a multinational manufacturer of a diversified range of industrial products and equipment with operations in countries 
these businesses are internally reported as operating segments to senior management 
the company s operating segments have been aggregated into the following eight external reportable segments transportation  industrial packaging  power systems electronics  food equipment  construction products  polymers fluids  decorative surfaces  and all other 

table of contents due to the large number of diverse businesses and the company s highly decentralized operating style  the company does not require its businesses to provide detailed information on operating results 
instead  the company s corporate management collects data on several key measurements operating revenues  operating income  operating margins  overhead costs  number of months on hand in inventory  days sales outstanding in accounts receivable  past due receivables and return on invested capital 
these key measures are monitored by management and significant changes in operating results versus current trends in end markets and variances from forecasts are discussed with operating unit management 
the results of each segment are analyzed by identifying the effects of changes in the results of the base businesses  newly acquired companies  restructuring costs  goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges  and currency translation on the operating revenues and operating income of each segment 
base businesses are those businesses that have been included in the company s results of operations for more than months 
the changes to base business operating income include the estimated effects of both operating leverage and changes in variable margins and overhead costs 
operating leverage is the estimated effect of the base business revenue changes on operating income  assuming variable margins remain the same as the prior period 
as manufacturing and administrative overhead costs usually do not significantly change as a result of revenues increasing or decreasing  the percentage change in operating income due to operating leverage is usually more than the percentage change in the base business revenues 
a key element of the company s business strategy is its continuous business process for both existing businesses and new acquisitions 
the basic concept of this business process is to focus on what is most important the of the items which account for of the value and to spend less time and resources on the less important the of the items which account for of the value 
the company s operations use this business process to simplify and focus on the key parts of their business  and as a result  reduce complexity that often disguises what is truly important 
the company s operations utilize the process in various aspects of their businesses 
common applications of the business process include simplifying product lines by reducing the number of products offered by combining the features of similar products  outsourcing products or  as a last resort  eliminating low value products 
segmenting the customer base by focusing on the customers separately and finding alternative ways to serve the customers 
simplifying the supplier base by partnering with suppliers and reducing the number of suppliers 
designing business processes  systems and measurements around the activities 
the result of the application of this business process is that the company has over time improved its long term operating and financial performance 
these efforts can result in restructuring projects that reduce costs and improve margins 
corporate management works closely with those businesses that have operating results below expectations to help those businesses better apply this business process and improve their results
