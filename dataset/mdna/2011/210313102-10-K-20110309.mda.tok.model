executive overview we are a leading provider of online marketing solutions  including email marketing  social media marketing  event marketing and surveys  for small organizations  including small businesses  associations and non profits

we are committed to small businesses and organizations and have a long history of delivering cost effective  easy to use products  support  knowhow and coaching with a personal touch  all of which empower our customers to create and grow their own customer relationships 
we market our products and acquire our customers through a variety of sources including online marketing  including search engines and advertising on online networks and other websites  offline marketing through television and radio advertising  local seminars and other marketing efforts  relationships with our partners  referrals from our growing customer base  general brand awareness and the inclusion of a link to our website in the footer of the emails sent by our customers 

table of contents our on demand email marketing product was first offered in since that time we have experienced significant growth in revenue and number of customers 
we ended with approximately  unique paying customers and had revenue for that year of million 
our business strategy focuses on expanding beyond email marketing to support a multi product strategy to drive high customer lifetime value through gains in average revenue per customer  retention and gross margin 
we believe increasing our customer s lifetime value will be a key contributor to our continued success 
to drive lifetime value we will continue to invest in acquiring new customers  cross selling our products to our large and growing customer base and driving increased product usage by our customers 
we will continue to invest in broadening our platform of engagement marketing solutions  which we believe will enable our customers to create and grow their customer and member relationships 
in  we made numerous investments to drive future growth in may  we acquired nutshell mail  inc  a delaware corporation  to extend our social media marketing capabilities 
we offer nutshellmail  a free social media monitoring tool designed for small businesses 
we opened a san francisco office to focus on social media marketing research and development and we are offering specific educational programs for small businesses to help them better understand how to use social media 
social media features are now integrated into all of our product offerings 
we created a dedicated event marketing business unit and began scaling our sales and marketing investments to drive future growth of this product 
in addition to providing an expanded value proposition to our existing customer base  we believe event marketing represents a great opportunity to attract new customers 
we finished with over  event marketing customers 
in september  we launched our first national television advertising campaign  a new mass reach medium that allows us to raise awareness with a new audience 
we believe television advertising strengthens awareness in the marketplace and can feed future growth 
we continued to invest in our partner channels through our appconnect program and by partnering with new solutions providers and co marketing partners 
our partner channel allows us to expand our reach to customers who might not otherwise use our products 
additionally  partner sourced customers tend to have higher average monthly revenue  higher retention rates and lower support costs in february  we acquired substantially all of the assets of bantam networks llc  a provider of social customer relationship management software  or crm 
we expect to utilize bantam network s social crm technology to create a unified repository of customer data across all channels  including clicks  email opens  survey responses  event participation and social media interactions 
we believe this technology will play an important role in how data is captured  reported and analyzed for our customers  helping them better track  measure and increase customer engagement 
we anticipate that social crm functionality eventually will be incorporated into all of our products 
see also note subsequent events of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
key financial and operating metrics in connection with the ongoing operation of our business  our management regularly reviews key financial and operating metrics 
given our strategy we pay particular attention to customer acquisition metrics  number of products per customer and average revenue per customer 
we also consider other operating metrics such as revenue  gross margin  expenses  cost of acquisition  trialer growth  conversion rates for our website visitors and our trialers  customer attrition  customer satisfaction rates  success in cross selling and growing customer list sizes  average speed of answer for customer support calls  email deliverability rates and capital expenditures  among others 
management considers these financial and operating metrics critical to understanding and improving our business  reviewing our historical performance  benchmarking our performance versus other companies and identifying current and future trends  and for planning purposes 

table of contents in addition  we consider the following non gaap financial measures to be key indicators of our financial performance adjusted ebitda  which we define as gaap net income loss plus depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation  minus interest and other income and adjusted for income taxes  adjusted ebitda margin  which we define as adjusted ebitda divided by revenue  and free cash flow  which we define as net cash flow from operating activities less acquisition of property and equipment 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures are useful to management and investors in evaluating our operating performance for the periods presented and provide a tool for evaluating our ongoing operations 
these non gaap financial measures  however  are not a measure of financial performance under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  and should not be considered a substitute for gaap financial measures  including but not limited to net income loss or cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
certain trends and uncertainties the following represents a summary of certain trends and uncertainties  which could have a significant impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
this summary is not intended to be a complete list of potential trends and uncertainties that could impact our business in the long or short term 
the summary should be considered along with the factors set forth under item a risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we continue to closely monitor current economic conditions  particularly as they impact small businesses  associations and non profits 
while the overall economy appears to be improving  we believe that small organizations continue to experience some amount of economic hardship 
if this economic hardship continues or worsens  our financial results could be adversely impacted 
we believe that given the size of our potential market and the relatively low barriers to entry  competition will continue to increase 
increased competition could result from existing competitors or new competitors that enter the market because of the potential opportunity 
we will continue to closely monitor competitive activity and respond accordingly 
increased competition could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that as we continue to grow revenue at expected rates  our cost of revenue and operating expenses  including sales and marketing  research and development and general and administrative expenses  will increase in absolute dollar amounts 
for a description of the general trends we anticipate in various expense categories  see cost of revenue and operating expenses below 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
year over year we experienced a decline in our investment income as a result of the reduction in interest rates generally 
sources of revenue we derive our revenue principally from subscription fees from our customers 
our revenue is driven primarily by the number of paying customers and the subscription fees for our products and is not concentrated within any one customer or group of customers 
in  our top customers accounted for less than of our total revenue 
we do not require our customers to commit to a contractual term  however  our customers are required to prepay for subscriptions on a monthly  semi annual  or annual basis by providing a credit card or bank check 
fees are recorded initially as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue on a daily basis over the prepaid subscription period 

table of contents we also generate a small amount of revenue from ancillary services related to our products  which primarily consist of custom services and training through our experts program 
revenue generated from professional services and training accounted for approximately of gross revenue for each of the years ended december   and cost of revenue and operating expenses we allocate certain occupancy and general office related expenses  such as rent  utilities  office supplies and depreciation of general office assets to cost of revenue and operating expense categories based on headcount 
as a result  an occupancy expense allocation is reflected as personnel related costs in cost of revenue and each operating expense category 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of wages and benefits for software operations and customer support personnel  credit card processing fees and depreciation and amortization  maintenance and hosting of our software applications underlying our product offerings 
we allocate a portion of customer support costs relating to assisting trial customers to sales and marketing expense 
the expenses related to our hosted software applications are affected by the number of customers who subscribe to our products and the complexity and redundancy of our software applications and hosting infrastructure 
we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars as we expect to increase our number of customers 
additionally  as we transition to a new third party hosting facility in california in  we expect cost of revenue to increase as a percentage of revenue in the short term but to decrease over time as we gain efficiencies created by our expected revenue growth and cost savings resulting from this new hosting facility 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for product strategy and development personnel 
we have focused our research and development efforts on improving ease of use  functionality and technological scalability of our existing products as well as on developing new offerings 
we primarily expense research and development costs 
however  direct development costs related to software enhancements that add functionality are capitalized and amortized over their useful life 
we expect that on an annual basis research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to enhance and expand our product offerings  but decline as a percentage of revenue as we expect to continue to grow our revenue at a faster rate 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotional costs  wages and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  partner referral fees and the portion of customer support costs that relate to assisting trial customers 
advertising costs consist primarily of pay per click advertising with search engines  other online and offline advertising media  including television  radio and print advertisements  as well as the costs to create and produce these advertisements 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred 
promotional costs consist primarily of public relations  memberships and event costs 
in order to continue to grow our business and brand and category awareness  we expect that we will continue to commit substantial resources to our sales and marketing efforts 
as a result  we expect that on an annual basis  sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we expect to continue to grow our revenue at a faster rate 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for administrative  human resources  internal information technology support  finance and accounting personnel  professional fees  board compensation and expenses  certain taxes and other corporate expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to add personnel in connection with the anticipated growth of our business and incur costs related to operating as a public company 
therefore  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but remain generally consistent or decline slightly as a percentage of revenue as we expect to continue to grow our revenue at a similar rate 

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
accordingly  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
see also note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of our other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we provide access to our products through subscription arrangements whereby the customer is charged a fee for access for a defined term 
subscription arrangements include access to use our software via the internet and support services  such as telephone support 
when there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is deemed reasonably assured  we recognize revenue on a daily basis over the subscription period as the services are delivered 
we also offer ancillary services to our customers related to our products such as custom services and training through our experts program 
custom services and training revenue is accounted for separate from subscription revenue as those services have value on a standalone basis  do not involve a significant degree of risk or unique acceptance criteria and as the fair value of our subscription services is evidenced by their availability on a standalone basis 
custom services and training revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
income taxes 
income taxes are provided for tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of income taxes currently due plus deferred income taxes related to timing differences between the basis of certain assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in our financial statements by applying a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets 
we record goodwill when consideration paid in a purchase acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets and the identified intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant a review 
we perform our assessment for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and we have determined that there is a single reporting unit for the purpose of conducting this annual goodwill impairment assessment 
for purposes of assessing potential impairment  we annually estimate the fair value of the reporting unit based on our market capitalization and compare this amount to the carrying value of the reporting unit as reflected by our total stockholders equity 
if we determine that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge would be required 
we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill on november  based upon that evaluation  we determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
as the pattern of consumption of the economic benefits 
table of contents of the intangible assets cannot be reliably determined  we amortize acquired intangible assets over their estimated useful lives on a straight line basis 
software and website development costs 
relative to development costs of our on demand products and website  we capitalize certain direct costs to develop functionality as well as certain upgrades and enhancements that are probable to result in additional functionality 
the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  are capitalized as part of property and equipment until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
once placed in use  capitalized software is amortized over a three year period in the expense category to which the software relates 
stock based compensation 
we value all stock based compensation  including grants of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  at fair value on the date of grant  and expense the fair value over the applicable service period 
the straight line method is applied to all awards with service conditions  while the graded vesting method is applied to all awards with both service and performance conditions 
we base the fair value of common stock on the quoted market price of our stock 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the fair value of common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
because we have a limited history of operating as a public company  the expected term assumption is based on the simplified method for estimating expected term for awards that qualify as plain vanilla options 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of the publicly traded stocks of a peer group of companies  inclusive of us  commencing october the risk free interest rate is determined by reference to us treasury yields at or near the time of grant for time periods similar to the expected term of the award 
the relevant data used to determine the value of the stock option grants is as follows year ended december  weighted average risk free interest rate expected term in years weighted average expected volatility expected dividends these assumptions represented our best estimates  but the estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different 
authoritative guidance requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of awards that are expected to vest 
in developing a forfeiture rate estimate  we have considered our historical experience to estimate pre vesting forfeitures for awards with service conditions 
for awards with performance conditions we estimate the probability that the performance condition will be met 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period

liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal sources of liquidity were cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million

table of contents of additional offices in the united states and worldwide and the building of infrastructure necessary to support our anticipated growth  the response of competitors to our products and our relationships with suppliers and clients 
since the introduction of our on demand email marketing product in  we have experienced increases in our expenditures consistent with the growth in our operations and personnel  and we anticipate that our expenditures will continue to increase on an absolute dollar basis in the future 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
thereafter  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private financings or borrowings to fund our operations  develop or enhance products  to fund expansion  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire complementary products  businesses or technologies 
if required  additional financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us  or at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders or we may be subject to covenants that restrict how we conduct our business 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders and us 
during the last three years  inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business 
we are unable to predict whether inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not engage in any off balance sheet financing activities 
we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities  which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities 
new accounting guidance in september  the financial accounting standards board issued authoritative guidance on revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this guidance provides another alternative for establishing fair value for a deliverable 
when vendor specific objective evidence or third party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined  companies will be required to develop a best estimate of the selling price for separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the relative selling price method 
this guidance is effective january   and early adoption is permitted 
we do not believe the adoption of this guidance will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the emerging issues task force issued new accounting guidance on disclosures about supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
the guidance amends existing disclosure criteria  specifying that if a public company presents comparative financial statements it should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior year annual reporting period only 
the guidance also expands the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include descriptions of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination that are included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the guidance is prospective and is effective for business combinations occurring after january  as the new guidance relates only to disclosure  adoption will not have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations we lease our headquarters under an operating lease that is effective through september with one five year extension option 
the lease includes the space we are occupying now as well as additional space that will be made available to us through the term of the lease

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenue and expenses are generally denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  our results of operations and cash flows are not subject to material fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate sensitivity 
we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at december   which consisted of cash  government securities  corporate and agency bonds  commercial paper and money market instruments 
interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  however  due to the nature of these investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates have reduced our interest income in as compared to
