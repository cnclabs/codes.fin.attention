we have tried to identify forward looking statements by using words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  intend  project  will  potential and similar expressions  but these words are not the exclusive means of identifying forward looking statements 
these statements are based on information currently available to us and are subject to various risks  uncertainties  and other factors  including  but not limited to  those matters discussed in item a risk factors in part i of this annual report on form k that could cause our actual growth  results of operations  cash flows  performance  business prospects and opportunities to differ materially from those expressed in  or implied by  these statements 
except as expressly required by the federal securities laws  we undertake no obligation to update such factors or to publicly announce the results of any of the forward looking statements contained herein to reflect future events  developments  or changed circumstances  or for any other reason 
as used in this annual report on form k  the terms we  us  our  the company  and cec refer to career education corporation and our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the terms school and university each refer to an individual  branded  proprietary educational institution  owned by us and including its campus locations 
the term campus refers to an individual main or branch campus operated by one of our school or universities 
overview cec is an industry leader whose institutions are recognized globally 
those institutions include  among others  american intercontinental university aiu  brooks institute  colorado technical university ctu  harrington college of design  inseec group inseec schools  international university of monaco ium  international academy of design technology iadt  istituto marangoni  le cordon bleu north america lcb  and sanford brown institutes and colleges 
through its schools  cec is committed to providing high quality education  enabling students to graduate and pursue rewarding career opportunities 
during  we organized our businesses across four reporting segments which included university  health education  culinary arts and international 
each segment represents a group of postsecondary education providers that offer a variety of degree and non degree academic programs 
these segments were organized by key market segment to enhance brand focus and operational alignment within each segment to more effectively execute our strategic growth plan 
in december  we completed the teach out of our last remaining transitional school  aiu los angeles  ca 
as a result  all current and prior period results have been presented as a component of discontinued operations 
as all schools within transitional schools have ceased operations  this reporting segment no longer exists 
additionally  during  we completed a detailed review of our shared service costs to determine which of these costs should be charged to the segments as well as how these shared service costs should be allocated 
these services include legal  finance  human resources  marketing  certain academic functions and certain centralized activities related to student finance  including financial aid processing  student account posting and collections 
these costs  recorded within corporate and other  were previously allocated to our segments based upon a percentage of revenue 
improved data and analytical capabilities have provided us insight into costs being incurred to support the segments versus costs being incurred to support the corporation as a whole 
the new methodology allocates costs based on usage and consumption factors such as student population  employee headcount  advertising spend  number of financial aid recipients and revenue where appropriate 
in the case of certain services which are shared evenly across the segments  we allocate equally 
the new methodology is intended to provide improved transparency into the costs of the shared services 
the effect of these changes 
table of contents impacts the costs reported within each segment and reduces the level of unallocated shared service costs 
results beginning in are presented under the new methodology and prior period results have been revised to be comparable to the current reporting 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the md a is intended to help investors understand the results of operations  financial condition and present business environment 
the md a is organized as follows overview and outlook consolidated results of operations segment results of operations summary of significant accounting policies and estimates liquidity  financial position and capital resources overview and outlook was a year of accomplishments as well as challenges for cec 
we experienced improved financial performance  as total revenue increased to  million for the year ended december  as compared to total revenue of  million 
operating income increased by as compared to  and student population grew over the prior year driven by strong new student start growth in the first half of each of our four operating segments experienced an increase in revenue  and our university  health education and international segments increased operating margins as compared to  as these segments continued to leverage their existing cost structures 
due to two significant charges impacting our culinary arts segment  a million asset impairment charge and a million charge related to a legal settlement  operating margins declined as compared to we continued to extend our geographic presence in our health education segment throughout the year 
contributing to the revenue growth within health education was the opening of six new campuses in sbc hillside  il  sbi cranston  ri  sbc tinley park  il  sbc indianapolis  in  sbc skokie  il and sbc portland  or 
these campuses provide us with the opportunity to continue to expand our presence in key locations throughout the united states 
we expect to continue to expand our health education footprint in by opening new us campuses 
in addition to opening new campuses within the united states  we continued to expand our existing international operations with the acquisition of ium in april total consideration was approximately million  which included million of purchase price and million related to the assumption of outstanding shareholder loans 
ium is a leading international business university located in monaco  offering bachelor s  master s and doctoral programs in such areas as finance  international business and luxury goods and services 
ium has joined the inseec group and will position inseec for continued growth as a leader in postsecondary education in europe 
despite year over year improvement in several key metrics including student population  new student starts  revenue and operating income  we also experienced challenges  particularly in the second half of the year 
these challenges included changes in the regulatory environment  heightened scrutiny from government representatives and news media and the softening of new student interest 
to better position us for future growth  and to address the challenges cec and others in private sector education face  we made a number of decisions that impacted our organizational structure and operating business model in a number of key areas 
these decisions led to certain charges being recorded in the fourth quarter we made changes to our infrastructure in an effort to reduce costs in the corporate organization  increase spans of control for senior leaders  consolidate like processes and functions under common leadership  position 
table of contents the organization to better serve its internal customers and continue the offering of shared services 
as a result  we announced a reduction in our workforce of approximately positions across our us operations in january the elimination of these positions is expected to be completed in the first several months of this consolidation and streamlining of our operations and creation of a shared services organization resulted in a severance charge of approximately million which was recorded in the fourth quarter of this charge is reflected within general and administrative expense within our consolidated statements of operations 
during  culinary art s operating results included an impairment charge of million related to the le cordon bleu trade name 
this non cash charge was a result of its carrying value exceeding its estimated fair value 
the fair value of the le cordon bleu trade name declined as a result of the changes being made to the culinary arts operating model 
culinary arts maintains its dedication to providing its students with the most beneficial outcomes and as such the company has made the decision to change its operating model in early we believe this change will position us better to potentially appeal to an even broader market and responds to the current regulatory environment 
the new operating model increases focus on our month certificate program  which has a lower tuition level than our degree programs 
in addition  we are decreasing the tuition cost of our certificate program within culinary arts beginning in the second quarter of due to the reduced tuition level  we do not believe students will need as much financing support outside of their eligibility to participate in the title iv programs  thus reducing the need for the company to offer extended payment plan programs 
as a result  the company will no longer offer new students extended payment plan financing 
we will continue to honor our commitment to students already receiving this type of funding  so that these students are able to complete their entire course of study 
as a percent of revenue  we expect bad debt expense to decrease as compared to as a result of the business model changes within culinary arts 
in addition to the trade name impairment  culinary arts recorded a million charge related to the settlement of an outstanding legal matter for california culinary academy  as well as a goodwill impairment non cash charge of million associated with our decision to teach out all programs at our lcb pittsburgh  pa campus 
the decision to teach out all programs at our lcb pittsburgh  pa campus was another step towards making strategic investment decisions for our future culinary arts business model 
the current year results also included a million increase in bad debt expense within culinary arts primarily related to increasing the reserve rates attributable to our student extended payment plans 
the company has committed to million of funding through its extended payment plans as of december  this commitment is generally based upon an estimate of the amount of additional financial aid needed by our students for a given academic year  less an anticipated cancellation rate for those plans that are later reduced or cancelled out entirely 
this estimated amount could vary materially from what is ultimately provided to our students 
the company expects to commit up to an additional million of extended payment plan funding as current students complete their course of study and the program phases out 
as of december   the amount of earned student receivables under student extended payment plans  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and net of deferred tuition revenue  was million  of which the majority relates to culinary arts 
the committed amount of extended payment plans includes those amounts which have not yet been earned and as such are not reflected within student receivables and also includes those amounts which have already been repaid by students 
during  university continued its focus on quality driven programs for its students and providing better access to financing literacy tools 
these improvements allow students to better prepare themselves for their chosen careers and assess their financial outcomes 
as disclosed previously  the higher learning commission s hlc board of trustees had validated the hlc advisory team s recommendation related to its review of aiu 
during the third quarter of  we submitted two new programs to hlc for approval 
hlc is reviewing these programs in accordance with its regular practices 
we believe this is another positive step for the aiu institution 
additionally  a new tuition model was instituted in the first quarter of for the associate and bachelor s degree programs within aiu and ctu 
the net effect of this change was to decrease the cost for bachelor s degrees and increase the cost for associate degrees 
these changes  along with enhanced student advisor training  enable our institutions to remain competitive in the postsecondary education industry 

table of contents we believe the creation of a shared services organization  combined with the change in the business model within our culinary arts segment and changes within university  will allow cec to remain competitive in our industry and provide a further differentiation in the constantly changing industry environment 
also  we will continue to enhance the services we offer to students through our innovative technology and continued focus on strong student outcomes by assessing student readiness to engage in college level work at the onset of the students program 
as we examine our company s organizational structure and make changes to our business and operating models  we will be careful to not sacrifice the high quality educational experience we offer our students by continuing to emphasize quality and integrity 
we expect to be a challenging year  as we continue to address the impact of a weak economic environment and the decline in new student starts and average student population 
our changes in operating model will align us for long term success  yet we anticipate to be a year of transition  especially for culinary arts 
during  cec will continue to remain focused on enhancing the quality of education and student services in order to prepare students for success in their chosen careers 
we believe investment in key areas such as ongoing student engagement in the process of life long learning  improved student experiences related to career services support and heightened social responsibility within our health education segment as well as our other institutions  will position us to continue to change lives through education 
additionally  cec will continue to build upon the compliance culture that we have established over time and ensure our students have clear information about our programs  including their financial obligations  the demands of our programs and the range of potential outcomes 
industry environment we operate in a highly regulated environment subject to changes in government regulations as well as changes in academic accreditation agencies and state education regulatory authorities 
we have instituted systems  processes and programs in all of our schools to ensure substantial compliance with all regulations 
recent and pending regulations released and to be released by the us department of education ed may impact several key areas related to title iv program funding eligibility in the for profit postsecondary education sector 
on october   ed issued final regulations pertaining to certain aspects of the administration of the title iv programs  including  but not limited to state authorization  gainful employment  compensation rules for persons engaged in certain aspects of admissions and financial aid  determination of attendance and definition of credit hours 
with one exception  these regulations will become effective july  ed previously announced that it was delaying until early publication of final regulations on certain further proposed gainful employment regulations  which are expected to become effective on july  or thereafter 
the october  regulations contain changes from the proposed regulations issued by ed in june the company continues to analyze the final regulations  to identify and assess potential impacts to our business and to consider and evaluate various strategies to address those potential impacts 
these new and pending regulations could have significant impacts on our business 
among the most significant regulatory changes that we have identified to date for our business are the elimination of certain safe harbors that had allowed  under limited and prescribed circumstances  payment of certain types of compensation to employees including higher level employees and third parties involved in student enrollment  certain recruiting  admissions or financial aid activities  imposition of extensive record keeping and disclosure requirements respecting the employment of graduates  as a precursor to proposed gainful employment regulations  described above  that would base the eligibility of specific programs to enroll students receiving title iv program funds on certain yet to be defined metrics including but not limited to cost of education  future earnings  student loan defaults and debt incurred in the securing of such education  
table of contents defining a credit hour for purposes of determining program eligibility for title iv student financial aid  establishing more stringent state approval criteria that may require or encourage states to modify existing state approval and licensing processes  requiring an institution that offers distance learning programs to secure the approval of each state where it enrolls students to the extent any such state requires such approval and provide evidence of such approval to ed upon request  and strengthening the definition of proscribed misrepresentation to include  among other things  erroneous statements  including erroneous statements made by certain third party vendors under contract to an institution  which may increase institutional liability and subject institutions to sanctions for statements containing inadvertent errors  and expose institutions to costly third party litigation 
as of the date of this filing  we are still assessing the most recently released regulations and have begun to implement changes to address these regulations 
we cannot predict the outcome of the portion of the gainful employment rules that are expected to be issued in  or predict with certainty the impact of the new regulations on our operations 
these rules could affect the manner in which we conduct our business and compliance with these rules could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we anticipate that our culinary arts and art design institutions will be most impacted by the gainful employment rules that are expected to be issued in we continue to review our business models and expect to be in a position to respond with action plans to address changes that may be required as a result of the final gainful employment rules

summary of significant accounting policies and estimates we have identified the accounting policies and estimates listed below as those that we believe require management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived primarily from academic programs taught to students who attend our schools 
we generally segregate our revenue into two categories tuition and registration fees and other 
tuition and registration fees represent costs to our students for educational services provided by our schools 
we generally bill a student for a one time registration fee at the beginning of the student s program and we recognize the registration fee revenue on a straight line basis over that program period  which includes any applicable externship period 
we generally bill student tuition fees at the beginning of each academic term  and we recognize the tuition fees as revenue on a straight line basis over either the academic term or program period  which includes any applicable externship period 
the tuition fees earnings method is determined by the type of program a student is enrolled in 
typically  schools that offer our culinary arts and some of our health programs earn tuition fees over the entire course of the program while the remainder of our schools earn tuition fees over each academic term 
the portion of tuition and registration fees payments received from students but not earned is recorded as deferred tuition revenue and reflected as a current liability on our consolidated balance sheet  as such amounts represent revenue that we expect to earn within the next year 
deferred tuition revenue is stated net of outstanding student receivables on a student by student basis as of the end of the reporting period 
if a student withdraws from one of our schools prior to the completion of the academic term or program period  we refund the portion of tuition and registration fees already paid that  pursuant to our refund policy and applicable federal and state law and accrediting agency standards  we are not entitled to retain 
generally  the amount of funds to be refunded to a student is calculated based upon the period of time in which the student has attended classes and 
table of contents the amount of tuition and registration fees paid by the student as of their withdrawal date 
such refunds typically reduce deferred tuition revenue and cash on the company s balance sheet as generally the company does not recognize tuition revenue in its consolidated statement of operations until related refund provisions have lapsed 
the portion of deferred revenue the company is entitled to retain is immediately recognized into revenue with a corresponding charge to bad debt expense for the amount deemed to be uncollectible 
our schools academic year is generally at least weeks in length but varies both by school and program of study and is divided by academic terms or payment periods 
academic terms or payment periods are determined by regulatory requirements mandated by the federal government and or appropriate accrediting body  which also vary by school and program 
academic terms are determined by start dates  which also vary by school and program 
our schools charge tuition at varying amounts  depending on the school  the type of program and specific curriculum 
our students finance costs through a variety of funding sources  including  among others  federal loan and grant programs  school payment plans  private loans and grants  private and institutional scholarships  and cash payments 
other revenue consists of  among other things  bookstore sales  student laptop computer sales  dormitory revenue  restaurant revenue  and cafeteria revenue 
revenue derived from dormitory and cafeteria services is generally billed to a student at the beginning of an academic term and is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of a student s dormitory and cafeteria use 
other dormitory and cafeteria revenue  as well as student laptop computer sales  bookstore sales  restaurant revenue and contract training revenue is billed and recognized as services are performed or goods are delivered 
certain of our schools bill students a single charge that covers tuition and required program materials  such as textbooks and supplies 
such billings  which we treat as a single accounting unit  are recognized as tuition and registration fee revenue on a straight line basis over the applicable academic term or program period 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend unsecured credit to a portion of the students who are enrolled at our schools for tuition and certain other educational costs 
based upon past experience and judgment  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to student receivables which the company estimates will ultimately not be collectible 
as such the company s operating income only reflects the amount of revenue that is estimated to be reasonably collected 
our allowance estimation methodology considers a number of factors that  based on our collections experience  we believe have an impact on students credit risk and the realizability of our student receivables 
among these factors are a student s status in school or out of school  anticipated funding source rd party  internal short term and extended payment plans  whether or not an out of school student has completed his or her program of study and our overall collections experience 
out of school students include students who have withdrawn from or completed their programs of study 
all other students are classified as in school students 
we monitor our collections and write off experience to assess whether adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary 
changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the realizability of our student receivables  as noted above  or modifications to our credit standards  collection practices  and other related policies may impact our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts and our financial results 
additionally  we monitor certain internal and external factors  including changes in our academic programs  as well as changes in the current economic  legislative and regulatory environments 
a one percentage point change in our allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of gross earned student receivables from continuing operations as of december   would have resulted in a change in pretax income from continuing operations of million during the year then ended 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from title iv programs  any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under title iv programs  or the ability of our students or schools to participate in title iv programs  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition  including the realizability of our receivables 

table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  we review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under fasb asc topic if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
in performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results and cash flows and market assumptions 
projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to  among other things  revenue growth and operating margins 
although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions  historically projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved 
the failure of one of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
we monitor the operating results and cash flows of our reporting units on a quarterly basis for signs of possible declines in estimated fair value and goodwill impairment 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill impairment considerations and related charges we recognized during the year ended december  long lived assets on an ongoing basis  we review property and equipment  definite lived intangible assets  and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its estimated fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the estimated fair value of such assets 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets 
see note property and equipment of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of long lived asset impairment considerations and related charges we recognized during the year ended december  contingencies in accordance with fasb asc topic contingencies  the company analyzes whether it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred  and whether the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the loss contingency is both probable and reasonably estimable  then we accrue for costs  including direct costs incurred  associated with the loss contingency 
if no accrual is made but the loss contingency is reasonably possible  we disclose the nature of the contingency and the related estimate of possible loss or range of loss if such an estimate can be made 
loss contingencies include  but are not limited to  possible losses related to legal proceedings and regulatory compliance matters 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb asc topic income taxes 
this requires the recognition of deferred income taxes based upon the tax consequences of temporary differences between 
table of contents financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
topic also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred income tax assets the expected future income tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
topic further clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return 
topic also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the initial application of this guidance to our tax positions had no effect on our stockholders equity 
liquidity  financial position  and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaled million 
our cash flows from operations have historically been adequate to fulfill our liquidity requirements 
we finance our operating activities and our organic growth primarily through cash generated from operations 
we finance acquisitions primarily through funding from credit facility borrowings and cash generated from operations 
we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy the cash requirements associated with  among other things  our working capital needs  capital expenditures and lease commitments through at least the next months primarily with cash generated by operations  existing cash balances  and  if necessary  borrowings under our existing credit agreement 
included in cash and cash equivalents within our consolidated balance sheets are amounts related to certain of our european campuses that are operated as not for profit schools 
the cash and cash equivalents related to these schools have restrictions which require that the funds be utilized for these particular not for profit schools 
the amount of not for profit cash and cash equivalents with restrictions was million and million at december  and  respectively 
restrictions on these cash balances have not affected  nor do we believe that such restrictions will affect  our ability to fund our daily operations 
sources and uses of cash operating cash flows during the years ended december  and  net cash flows provided by operating activities totaled million and million  respectively 
our primary source of cash flows from operating activities is tuition collected from our students 
our students finance tuition costs through the use of a variety of funding sources  including  among others  federal loan and grant programs  state grant programs  private loans and grants  school payment plans  private and 
table of contents institutional scholarships and cash payments 
for the twelve months ended december   and  approximately  and respectively  of our us schools cash receipts from tuition payments come from title iv program funding

our primary uses of cash to support our operating activities include  among other things  cash paid to employees for services  to vendors for products and services  to lessors for rents and operating costs related to leased facilities  to suppliers for textbooks and other school supplies  and to federal  state and local governments for income and other taxes 
although we anticipate that we will be able to satisfy cash requirements for working capital needs  capital expenditures  and commitments through at least the next year primarily with cash generated by our operations  existing cash balances and  if necessary  borrowings under our existing credit agreement  we are not able to assess the effect of loss contingencies on future cash requirements and liquidity

on november   we entered into a stock repurchase plan established in accordance with rule b of the securities exchange act of  as amended the act  in connection with our previously authorized stock repurchase program 
a rule b plan allows a company to repurchase its shares at times when it otherwise might be unable to do so under the act s insider trading rules

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use various techniques to manage our market risk  including  from time to time  the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
our municipal bond investments are auction rate securities ars which generally have stated terms to maturity of greater than one year 
we classify investments in ars on our consolidated balance sheets within other non current assets 
auctions can fail when the number of sellers of the security exceeds the buyers for that particular auction period 
in the event that an auction fails  the interest rate resets at a rate based on a formula determined by the individual security 
the ars for which auctions have failed continue to accrue interest and are auctioned on a set interval until the auction succeeds  the issuer calls the securities  or they mature 
as of december   we have determined these investments are at risk for impairment due to the nature of the liquidity of the market over the past year 
as a result  we recorded a cumulative unrealized loss reflected within other comprehensive loss income on our consolidated balance sheet of approximately million as of december  interest rate exposure any outstanding borrowings under our credit agreement bear annual interest at fluctuating rates as determined by the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor 
as of december  and  we had no outstanding borrowings under this agreement 
our investments and debt instruments are recorded at their fair values as of december  and we believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in interest rates is not significant 
foreign currency exposure we are subject to foreign currency exchange exposures arising from current and anticipated transactions denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  and from the translation of foreign currency balance sheet accounts into us dollar balance sheet accounts 
specifically  we are subject to risks associated with fluctuations in the value of the euro and the british pound versus the us dollar 
our investment in our foreign operations as of december   was not significant to our consolidated financial position 
we believe that the exposure of our consolidated financial position and results of operations and cash flows to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates is not significant
