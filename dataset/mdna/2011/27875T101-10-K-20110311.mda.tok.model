it contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  and is based on the beliefs of our management  as well as assumptions made by  and information currently available to  our management 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by our management in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a leading provider of technology enabled transportation and supply chain management services  delivered on a proprietary technology platform serving the transportation and logistics needs of our clients 
our proprietary web based technology platform compiles and analyzes data from our network of over  transportation providers to serve our clients shipping and freight management needs 
our technology platform  composed of web based software applications and a proprietary database  enables us to identify excess transportation capacity  obtain competitive rates  and execute thousands of shipments every day while providing high levels of service and reliability 
we focus primarily on arranging transportation across the major modes  including truckload tl  less than truck load ltl and small parcel  and we also offer inter modal which involves moving a shipment by rail and truck  domestic air  expedited and international transportation services 
we procure transportation and provide logistics services for more than  clients across a wide range of industries  such as manufacturing  construction  consumer products and retail 
our clients fall into two categories  enterprise and transactional 
we typically enter into multi year contracts with our enterprise clients  which are often on an exclusive basis for a specific transportation mode or point of origin 
as part of our value proposition  we also provide core logistics services to these clients 
we provide transportation and logistics services to our transactional clients on a shipment by shipment basis  typically with individual  or spot market  pricing 
revenue we generate revenue through the sale of transportation and logistics services to our clients 
revenue is recognized when the client product is delivered by a third party carrier 
our revenue was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  reflecting growth rates of  and  respectively  as compared to the corresponding prior year 
our revenue is generated from two different types of clients enterprise and t ransactional 
our enterprise accounts typically generate higher dollar amounts and volume than our transactional relationships 
we categorize a client as an enterprise client if we have a contract with the client for the provision of services on a recurring basis 
our contracts with enterprise clients typically have a multi year term and are often exclusive for a certain transportation mode or point of origin 
in several cases  we provide substantially all of a client transportation and logistics requirements 
we categorize all other clients as transactional clients 
we provide services to our transactional clients on a shipment by shipment basis 
as of december   we had enterprise clients and  fo r the year ended december  we served over  transactional clients 
for the year ended december   we entered into contracts with new enterprise clients 
for the years ended december   and  enterprise clients accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively  and transactional clients accounted for  and of our revenue  respectively 
we expect to continue to grow both our enterprise and transactional client base in the future  although the rate of growth for each type of client will vary depending on opportunities in the marketplace 
revenue recognized per shipment will vary depending on the transportation mode  fuel prices  shipment weight and density and mileage of the product shipped 
the primary modes of shipment that we transact in are tl  ltl and small parcel 
other transportation modes include inter modal  domestic air  expedited services and international 
typically  our revenue is lower for a n ltl shipment than for a tl shipment  and revenue per shipment is higher for shipments in modes other than tl  ltl and small parcel 
material shifts in the percentage of our revenue by transportation mode could have a significant impact on our revenue growth 
in  ltl accounted for of our revenue  tl accounted for of our revenue  small parcel accounted for of our revenue and other transportation modes accoun ted for of our revenue 
the transportation industry has historically been subject to seasonal sales fluctuations as shipments generally are lower during and after the winter holiday season because many companies ship goods and stock inventories prior to the winter holiday season 
while we have experienced some seasonality  differences in our revenue between periods have been driven primarily by growth in our client base 

table of contents transportation costs and net revenue we act primarily as a service provider to add value and expertise in the procurement and execution of transportation and logistics services for our clients 
our fee structure is primarily variable  although we have entered into a limited number of fixed fee arrangements that represent an insignificant portion of our revenue 
net revenue consists of transportation revenue minus transportation cost 
our transportation costs consist primarily of the direct cost of transportation paid to the carrier 
net revenue is the primary indicator of our ability to procure services provided by carriers and other third parties and is considered by management to be the primary measurement of our growth 
although our transportation cost is typically lower for an ltl shipment than for a tl shipment  our net revenue margin is typically higher for an ltl shipment than for a tl shipment 
material shifts in the percentage of our revenue by transportation mode  including small parcel  could have a significant impact on our net revenue 
the discussion of results of operations below focuses on changes in our net revenues and expenses as a percentage of net revenue margin 
in  and  our net revenue was million  million and million  respectively  reflecting growth rates of and in and  respectively  compared to the corresponding prior year 
operating expenses our costs and expenses excluding transportation costs consist of commissions paid to our sales personnel  selling  general and administrative expenses to run our business and depreciation and amortization 
commissions paid to our sales personnel  including employees and agents  are a significant component of our operating expenses 
these commissions are based on the net revenue we collect from the clients for which they have primary responsibility 
in  and  commission expense was  and  respectively  as a percentage of our net revenue 
the percentage of net revenue paid as commissions will vary depending on the type of client  composition of the sales team and mode of transportation 
commission expense  stated as a percentage of net revenue  could increase or decrease in the future depending on the composition of our revenue growth and the relative impact of changes in sales teams and service offerings 
we accrue for commission expense when we recognize the related revenue 
some of our sales personnel receive a monthly advance to provide them with a more consistent income stream 
cash paid to our sales personnel in advance of commissions earned is reflected as a prepaid expense on our balance sheet 
as our sales personnel earn commissions  a por tion of their commission payment is withheld and offset against their prepaid commission balance  if any 
our selling  general and administrative expenses  which excludes commission expense  primarily consist of compensation costs for our sales  operations  information systems  finance and administrative support employees and changes to contingent consideration liability 
in  and  our general and administrative expe nses were million  million and million  respectively 
in  and  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue were  and  respectively 
our depreciation expense is primarily attributable to our depreciation of purchases of computer hardware and software  equipment  furniture and fixtures  and the capitalization of internally developed software 
in  and  depreciation expense was million  million and million  respectively 
our amortization expense is attributable to our amortization of intangible assets acquired from business combinations  including client relationships  tradenames and non compete agreements 
in  and  amortization expense was million  million and million  respectively 
reverse stock split and recapitalization prior to our initial public offering  on september   we effectuated a one for two reverse stock split of all outstanding shares of our series a common stock  series b preferred stock and series d preferred stock 
immediately following the reverse stock split  we exchanged all outstanding shares of our series a common stock  series b preferred stock and series d preferred stock for newly issued shares of common stock on approximately a one for one basis 
income taxes on june   our company completed a con version pursuant to which echo global logistics  llc  a limited liability company  converted to echo global logistics  inc  a corporation 
as a limited liability company  we were treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
as a result  all items of income  expense  gain and loss of echo were generally reportable on the tax returns of members of echo global logistics  llc 
as a result of our conversion  we account for income taxes in accordance with asc topic previously sfas no 
 table of contents accounting for income taxes  under which deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
in connection with our conversion  we used million of our net proceeds from the issuance of our series d preferred stock to redeem certain of our series a common units 
because we redeemed the units as a limited liability company  the cash distribution was taxable to the members and our tax basis increased resulting in the recognition of a deferred tax asset of million  for which we recorded a valuation allowance of million and a corresponding net increase to additional paid in capital of million 
the company evaluated this valuation allowance as of december  and determined it was more likely than not that the existing deferred tax assets would be fully realized  thus the valuation allowance was reduced to zero with the corresponding income tax benefit recorded to income tax expense in there was no valuation allowance reversal in critical accounting policies revenue recognition in accordance with asc topic nb sp  revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process  transportation revenue and related transportation costs are recognized when the shipment has been delivered by a third party carrier 
fee for service revenue is recognized when the services have been rendered 
at the time of delivery or rendering of services  as applicable  the company obligation to fulfill a transaction is complete and collection of revenue is reasonably assured 
in accordance with asc topic reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  the company generally recognizes revenue on a gross basis  as opposed to a net basis similar to a commission arrangement  because it bears the risks and benefits associated with revenue generated activities by  among other things acting as a principal in the transaction  establishing prices  managing all aspects of the shipping process  and taking the risk of loss for collection  delivery  and returns 
certain transactions to provide specific services are recorded at the net amount charged to the client due to the following key factors a the company does not have latitude in establishing pricing  and b the company has credit risk for only the net revenue earned from its client while the carrier has credit risk for the transportation costs 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are uncollateralized customer obligations due under normal trade terms 
invoices require payment within to days from the invoice date 
accounts receivable are stated at the amount billed to the customer 
customer account balances with invoices past due days are considered delinquent 
the company generally does not charge interest on past due amounts 
the carrying amount of accounts receivable is reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts that reflects management best estimate of amounts that will not be collected 
the allowance is based on historical loss experience and any specific risks identified in client collection matters 
accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is d etermined that the receivable is uncollectible 
goodwill and other intangibles goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
in accordance with asc topic intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill is not amortized  but instead is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate a possible impairment may exist 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test 
for goodwill impairment test purposes  the company has one reporting unit 
in the first step  the fair value for the company is compared to its carrying value including goodwill 
in the case that the fair value is less than the carrying value  a second step is performed that compares the implied fair value of goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill 
the fair value for the implied goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities excluding goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 
absent any special circumstances that could require an interim test  the company has elected to test for goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of each year 
this guidance also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever impairme nt indicators exist in accordance with asc topic property  plant and equipment 
the company intangible assets consist of customer relationships  noncompete agreements  and trade names  which are being amortized on the straight line basis over their estimated weighted average useful lives of years  years and years  respectively 
contract costs cost of contracts represents the incremental direct costs incurred related to the acquisition or origination of certain 
table of contents customer contracts 
costs capitalized are amortized over the life of the contracts 
stock based compensation in  the company granted  options to certain employees at e xercise prices ranging from to  of which  will vest ratably over years 
the remaining  options will vest ratably over years 
the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with asc topic compensation stock compensation which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based upon their fair values 
share based employee compensation costs are recognized as a component of selling  general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of income 
the company recorded   and  in compensation expense for the years ended december   and  respectively

we elect to provide this benefit to foster strong relationships with our clients and carriers 
as our business grows  we expect this use of cash to continue
