item a 
risk factors our business is subject to many factors that could materially adversely affect our future performance and cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by forward looking statements made in this annual report on form k 
those risk factors are outlined below 
availability of raw materials and transportation systems  including sourcing from some single suppliers  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the chemical industry can experience some tightness of supply of certain materials or transportation systems 
in addition  in some cases  we choose to source from a single supplier 
any significant disruption in supply could affect our ability to obtain raw materials or transportation systems 
this could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
several of our products are produced solely at one facility  and a significant disruption or disaster at such a facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
several of the products we sell are produced only in one location 
we are dependent upon the continued safe operation of these production facilities 
these production facilities are subject to various hazards associated with the manufacturing  handling  storage  and transportation of chemical materials and products  including leaks and ruptures  explosions  fires  inclement weather and natural disasters  unscheduled downtime  and environmental hazards 
some of our products involve the manufacturing and handling of a variety of reactive  explosive  and flammable materials 
many of these hazards could cause a disruption in the production of our products 
we cannot assure you that these facilities will not experience these types of hazards and disruptions in the future or that these incidents will not result in production delays or otherwise have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows in any given period 

table of contents we may be unable to respond effectively to technological changes in our industry 
our future business success will depend upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  develop and market products and applications that meet changing customer needs  and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
our industry is characterized by frequent changes in industry performance standards  which affect the amount and timing of our research and development costs and other technology related costs 
as a result  the life cycle of our products is often hard to predict 
further  technological changes in some or all of our customers products or processes may make our products obsolete 
our inability to maintain a highly qualified technical workforce or their inability to anticipate  respond to  or utilize changing technologies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow in any given period 
our failure to protect our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our future performance and growth 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods  compounds  and other technologies is important to our business 
we depend upon our ability to develop and protect our intellectual property rights to distinguish our products from those of our competitors 
failure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or having to pay other companies for infringing on their intellectual property rights 
we rely on a combination of patent  trade secret  trademark  and copyright law  as well as judicial enforcement  to protect such technologies 
we currently own approximately  issued and pending us and foreign patents 
some of these patents are licensed to others 
in addition  we have acquired the rights under patents and inventions of others through licenses or otherwise 
we have developed  and may in the future develop  technologies with universities or other academic institutions  or with the use of government funding 
in such cases  the academic institution or the government may retain certain rights to the developed intellectual property 
we also own several hundred trademark and service mark registrations throughout the world for our marks  including newmarket  afton chemical  ethyl  hitec  tecgard  greenburn biotec  passion for solutions  cleanstart  polartech  and mmt  as well as pending trademark and service mark applications  including axcel and quickresponse sm 
in the event that we are unable to continue using certain of our marks  we may be forced to rebrand our products  which could result in the loss of brand recognition  and could require us to devote resources to advertise and market brands 
in particular  the loss of our hitec mark would have a material adverse effect on our business 
we cannot assure you that the measures taken by us to protect these assets and rights will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 
we cannot assure you that any of our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented  or rendered unenforceable 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that any pending patent application filed by us will result in an issued patent  or if patents are issued to us  that those patents will provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
the failure of our patents or other measures to protect our processes  apparatuses  technology  trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise  methods  and compounds could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies 
if we were found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others  we may be liable for damages  and we may be required to change our processes  to redesign our products partially or completely  to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely 
even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit  the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits 
we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 

table of contents our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses  any of which could interrupt our production or our transportation systems and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing  storage  handling  and transportation  including explosions  fires  inclement weather  natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  transportation interruptions  remediation  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases  and other risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment  and environmental contamination 
in addition  the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals 
accordingly  these hazards and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole  including our results of operations  and cash flows  both during and after the period of operational difficulties 
the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events  including natural disasters and domestic and international terrorist attacks may disrupt our operations  decrease demand for our products  and increase our expenses 
chemical related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the united states and throughout the world 
federal legislation has imposed significant new site security requirements  specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities  that will require an estimated million to million in capital expenditures over the next two years at our manufacturing facilities and increase our annual overhead expenses 
federal regulations have also been enacted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the united states 
further regulations could be enacted in the future  which could result in additional costs 
the occurrence of extraordinary events  including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities  cannot be predicted  but their occurrence can be expected to affect negatively the economy in general  and specifically the markets for our products 
the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets or assets used by us could include loss of life and property damage 
in addition  available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or  if available  may be prohibitively expensive 
competition could adversely affect our operating results 
we face intense competition in certain of the product lines and markets in which we compete 
we expect that our competitors will develop and introduce new and enhanced products  which could cause a decline in the market acceptance of certain products we manufacture 
in addition  as a result of price competition  we may be compelled to reduce the prices for some of our products  which could adversely affect our margins and profitability 
competitive pressures can also result in the loss of major customers 
our inability to compete successfully could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
in addition  some of our competitors may have greater financial  technological  and other resources than we have 
some of our competitors may also be able to maintain greater operating and financial flexibility than we are able to maintain 
as a result  these competitors may be able to better withstand changes in conditions within our industry  changes in the prices for raw materials  and changes in general economic conditions 
sudden or sharp raw materials price increases may adversely affect our profit margins 
we utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  including base oil  polyisobutylene  antioxidants  alcohols  solvents  sulfonates  friction modifiers  olefins  and copolymers 
our profitability is sensitive to changes in the costs of these materials caused by changes in supply  demand or other market conditions  over which we have little or no control 
political and economic conditions in the middle east and latin america have caused  and may continue to cause  the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate 
war  armed hostilities  terrorist acts  civil unrest  or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp increase in the cost of our raw materials 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to pass on to our customers any future increases in raw material costs in the form of price increases for our products 

table of contents our reliance on a small number of significant customers may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our principal customers are major multinational oil companies 
the oil industry is characterized by the concentration of a few large participants as a result of consolidation 
the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in purchases by a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flow 
our customers are concentrated in the lubricant and fuel industries and  as a result  our reliance on that industry is significant 
most of our customers are primarily engaged in the fuel and lubricant industries 
this concentration of customers affects our overall risk profile  since our customers will be similarly affected by changes in economic  geopolitical  and industry conditions 
many factors affect the level of our customers spending on our products  including  among others  general business conditions  changes in technology  interest rates  gasoline prices  and consumer confidence in future economic conditions 
a sudden or protracted downturn in these industries could adversely affect the buying power and purchases by our customers 
we face risks related to our foreign operations that may negatively affect our business 
in  sales to customers outside of the united states accounted for over of consolidated revenue 
we do business in all major regions of the world  some of which do not have stable economies or governments 
in particular  we sell and market products in countries experiencing political and economic instability in the middle east  asia pacific  and latin america 
our international operations are subject to international business risks  including unsettled political conditions  expropriation  import and export restrictions  increases in royalties  exchange controls  national and regional labor strikes  taxes  government royalties  inflationary economies and currency exchange rate fluctuations  and changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies such as restrictions on repatriation of earnings or proceeds from liquidated assets of foreign subsidiaries 
the occurrence of any one or a combination of these factors may increase our costs or have other adverse effects on our business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which may adversely affect our results of operations 
we conduct our business in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate 
the financial condition and results of operations of our foreign operating subsidiaries are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities  as well as our revenues  costs  and operating margins 
the primary foreign currencies in which we have exchange rate fluctuation exposure are the european union euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar have fluctuated significantly in recent years and may do so in the future 
political  economic  and regulatory factors concerning one of our products  mmt  could adversely affect our sales of mmt 
the united states epa studied mmt and determined that it does not cause or contribute to the failure of vehicle emission systems 
the canadian government has made similar findings 
the epa also required  under certain provisions of the clean air act  additional testing to fill some data gaps  including potential risks to public health 
the final report for the mmt alternative tier health testing program was accepted and requirements of the mandated program were deemed to have been met with submission of a june report to the epa 
no change in current determinations has been made 
in december  the government of canada released its proposed framework for an 
table of contents independent third party review of new information on the effects of mmt vehicle emissions 
in its proposal  the canadian government provided no timetable for the commencement or completion of the review  and to date  the government of canada has not initiated the review 
the european union eu finalized the latest version of the eu fuel quality directive in december  rejecting a proposed ban on mmt by the european parliament s environmental committee but implementing interim use limits and labeling requirements while a scientific risk assessment on metallic additives is carried out 
a legal challenge initiated by afton  seeking removal of these limits and labeling requirements while a risk assessment is underway  was rejected in the eu has not yet initiated a risk assessment for metallic additives 
certain industry and other interest groups continue to urge greater regulation of all metal based gasoline additives  including mmt 
these industry groups include the alliance of automobile manufacturers aam  the association of international automobile manufacturers  and the canadian vehicle manufacturers association  who allege generally that metallic additives impair the proper operation of vehicle emission control systems 
increased government regulation of mmt  if it occurs  or additional studies evaluating metallic additives  even if government regulation does not occur  could have a material adverse effect on our sales of mmt 
our business is subject to government regulation and could be adversely affected by future governmental regulation 
we are subject to regulation by local  state  federal  and foreign governmental authorities 
in some circumstances  before we may sell certain products  these authorities must approve these products  our manufacturing processes  and facilities 
we are also subject to ongoing reviews of our products  manufacturing processes  and facilities by governmental authorities 
in order to obtain regulatory approval of certain new products  we must  among other things  demonstrate to the relevant authority that the product is safe and effective for its intended uses and that we are capable of manufacturing the product in accordance with current regulations 
the process of seeking approvals can be costly  time consuming  and subject to unanticipated and significant delays 
there can be no assurance that approvals will be granted to us on a timely basis  or at all 
any delay in obtaining  or any failure to obtain or maintain  these approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new products and to generate sales from those products 
new laws and regulations  including climate change regulations  may be introduced in the future that could result in additional compliance costs  seizures  confiscation  recall  or monetary fines  any of which could prevent or inhibit the development  distribution  and sale of our products 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we may be subject to civil remedies  including fines  injunctions  and recalls or seizures  any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
our business and our customers are subject to significant regulations under the european commission s registration  evaluation and authorization of chemicals reach regulation 
reach became effective on june  it imposes obligations on european union manufacturers and importers of chemicals and other products into the european union to compile and file comprehensive reports  including testing data  on each chemical substance  perform chemical safety assessments  and obtain pre market authorization with respect to certain substances of particularly high concern 
the regulation imposes significant additional burdens on chemical producers and importers  and  to a lesser extent  downstream users of chemical substances and preparations 
our manufacturing presence and sales activities in the european union will require us to incur significant additional compliance costs 
legal proceedings and other claims could impose substantial costs on us 
we are involved in numerous administrative and legal proceedings that result from  and are incidental to  the conduct of our business 
from time to time  these proceedings involve environmental  product liability  tel  premises asbestos liability  and other matters 
see item  legal proceedings 
we have 
table of contents insurance coverage that we believe would be available to mitigate potential damages in many of these proceedings 
however  there is no assurance that our available insurance will cover these claims  that our insurers will not challenge coverage for certain claims  or that final damage awards will not exceed our available insurance coverage 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
environmental matters could have a substantial negative impact on our results of operations 
as a manufacturer and distributor of chemical products  we are generally subject to extensive local  state  federal  and foreign environmental  safety  and health laws and regulations concerning  among other things  emissions to the air  discharges to land and water  the generation  handling  treatment  and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials  and remediation of contaminated soil  surface  and ground water 
our operations entail the risk of violations of those laws and regulations  many of which provide for substantial fines and criminal sanctions for violations 
we believe that we comply in all material respects with laws  regulations  statutes  and ordinances protecting the environment  including those related to the discharge of materials 
however  we cannot assure you that we have been or will be at all times in compliance with all of these requirements 
in addition  these requirements  and the enforcement or interpretation of these requirements  may become more stringent in the future 
although we cannot predict the ultimate cost of compliance with any such requirements  the costs could be material 
noncompliance could subject us to material liabilities  such as government fines  damages arising from third party lawsuits  or the suspension and potential cessation of noncompliant operations 
we may also be required to make significant site or operational modifications at substantial cost 
future developments could also restrict or eliminate the use of or require us to make modifications to our products  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
at any given time  we are involved in claims  litigation  administrative proceedings  and investigations of various types in a number of jurisdictions involving potential environmental liabilities  including clean up costs associated with waste disposal sites  natural resource damages  property damage  and personal injury 
we cannot assure you that the resolution of these environmental matters will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows in any given period 
there may be environmental problems associated with our properties of which we are unaware 
some of our properties contain  or may have contained in the past  on site facilities or underground tanks for the storage of chemicals  hazardous materials  and waste products that could create a potential for release of hazardous substances or contamination of the environment 
the discovery of environmental liabilities attached to our properties could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition  and cash flows 
we may also face liability arising from current or future claims alleging personal injury  product liability  property damage due to exposure to chemicals or other hazardous substances  such as premises asbestos  at or from our facilities 
we may also face liability for personal injury  product liability  property damage  natural resource damage  or clean up costs for the alleged migration of contaminants or hazardous substances from our facilities or for future accidents or spills 
a significant increase in the number or success of these claims could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
for further discussion of some related claims  see item  business environmental 
the ultimate costs and timing of environmental liabilities are difficult to predict 
liability under environmental laws relating to contaminated sites can be imposed retroactively and on a joint and several basis 
a liable party could be held responsible for all costs at a site  whether currently or formerly owned or operated regardless of fault  knowledge  timing of the contamination  cause of the contamination  percentage of contribution to the contamination  or the legality of the original disposal 
we could incur significant costs  including clean up costs  natural resource damages  civil or criminal 
table of contents fines and sanctions  and third party claims  as a result of past or future violations of  or liabilities under  environmental laws 
we have been identified  and in the future may be identified  as a prp in connection with state and federal laws regarding environmental clean up projects 
we are subject to the federal  state and local environmental laws under which we may be designated as a prp 
as a prp  we may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up hazardous waste sites  such as a landfill to which we may have sent waste 
in de minimis prp matters and in some minor prp matters  we generally negotiate a consent decree to pay an apportioned settlement 
this relieves us of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
we are also a prp at sites where our liability may be in excess of the de minimis or minor prp levels 
most sites where we are a prp represent environmental issues that are quite mature 
the sites have been investigated  and in many cases  the remediation methodology  as well as the proportionate shares of each prp  has been established 
other sites are not as mature  which makes it more difficult to reasonably estimate our share of future clean up or remediation costs 
generally  environmental remediation and monitoring will go on for an extended period 
as a result  we may incur substantial expenses for all these sites over a number of years 
liability for investigation and remediation of hazardous substance contamination at currently or formerly owned or operated facilities or at third party waste disposal sites is joint and several 
currently  we are involved in active remediation efforts at several sites where we have been named a prp 
if other prps at these sites are unable to contribute to the remediation costs  we could be held responsible for some  or all  of their portion of the remediation costs  in addition to the portions for which we have already accounted 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 
our senior credit agreement and senior notes contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants may constrain our activities and limit our operational and financial flexibility 
the failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 
we maintain property  business interruption  and casualty insurance  but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations  including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered 
we may incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance policies  including liabilities for environmental remediation 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels  and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 
landlord and financing risks associated with foundry park i could adversely affect our financial results 
in january  foundry park i entered into a deed of lease agreement with meadwestvaco under which it is leasing an office building which we have constructed on approximately three acres 
our landlord and financing activities may subject us to the following risks we may incur costs associated with our landlord activities that exceed our expectations and result in the foundry park i operations materially negatively impacting our results of operations for our real estate development segment  and we may incur losses  which could be material  under the goldman sachs interest rate swap agreement 
see note for further information on the interest rate swap 

table of contents we may not be able to complete recent or future acquisitions or successfully integrate recent or future acquisitions into our business  which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
as part of our business growth strategy  we intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities 
our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
the expense incurred in completing acquisitions or entering into joint ventures  the time it takes to integrate an acquisition  or our failure to integrate businesses successfully  could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
furthermore  we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
our financial results will vary according to the timing of customer orders and other external factors  which complicates your ability to gauge our performance 
external factors beyond our control  such as customer orders  product shipment dates  and other factors can cause shifts in net sales and income from quarter to quarter 
these external factors can magnify the impact of industry cycles 
as a result  our income and cash flows may fluctuate significantly on a quarter to quarter basis  and your ability to gauge trends in our business may be impaired 
we could be required to make additional contributions to our pension plans  which may be underfunded due to any underperformance of the equities markets 
our pension plan asset allocation is predominantly weighted towards equities 
cash contribution requirements to our pension plans are sensitive to changes in our plans actual return on assets 
reductions in our plans return on assets due to poor performance of the equities markets could cause our pension plans to be underfunded and require us to make additional cash contributions

overview we had many accomplishments in as we realized record profits and reached a return of product demand to pre recessionary levels 
our petroleum additives business attained the highest profits on record through strong sales volumes and operating margins that reflect the value our technology driven products provide to our customers 
our plants are running safely at high levels  we increased our production capacity in singapore  we expanded our capability in research and development through new investment in people and facilities  and we expanded our regional presence to better meet our customers needs 
in addition  we completed the acquisition of the polartech group of companies polartech  a leading metal working additive company  which provides afton an opportunity to further expand in the industrial additives market 
our foundry park project was operational for the entire year with long term financing being secured in january and the tenant occupying the entire building  as expected 
finally  our financial position remains strong  with million of cash on our balance sheet 
we obtained a new  unsecured million revolving line of credit from a group of banks  replacing the million secured facility 
we also repurchased million of our common stock during the year 

table of contents results of operations revenue our consolidated revenue for amounted to  million  representing an increase of approximately from  million in the decrease of million between and was 
net sales to one customer of our petroleum additives segment exceeded of consolidated revenue in   and sales to royal dutch shell plc and its affiliates shell amounted to million of consolidated revenue in  million of consolidated revenue in  and million of consolidated revenue in these sales represent a wide range of products sold to this customer in multiple regions of the world 
no other single customer accounted for or more of our total revenue in   or the following table shows revenue by segment for each of the last three years 
consolidated revenue by segment in millions of dollars petroleum additives real estate development all other consolidated revenue petroleum additives net sales of our petroleum additives segment were higher in than in  while petroleum additives net sales were lower than net sales in of  million were million or higher than net sales of  million 
the increase in net sales reflects higher total product shipments of  including the benefit of polartech shipments during the increase in product shipments was across most product lines  but primarily in the lubricant additives product lines 
selling prices were also favorable for as compared to an unfavorable foreign currency impact of million partially offset the increase in product shipments and selling prices 
while recovering in from the worldwide economic slowdown  product shipments were weaker than normal during the first half of we believe the overall demand for petroleum additive products has recovered from recessionary effects and are now at levels consistent with normal market demands 
net sales in of  million were million or lower than the amount of  million 
the decrease between the two years reflects lower total product shipments  as well as a significant unfavorable foreign currency impact of million 
product shipments were lower when comparing and the decrease in shipments was primarily in the lubricant additives product lines  which was partially offset by a modest increase in fuel additives product lines shipments 
while product shipments were lower when comparing the two years  when comparing the second half of each year  shipments increased in over the unfavorable impact on net sales between and from shipments was partially offset by higher selling prices  which were implemented in the unfavorable impact from foreign currency reflects the strengthening of the us dollar between and versus the other currencies in which we conduct business 

table of contents the approximate components of the petroleum additives increase in net sales of million when comparing to and the decrease in net sales of million when comparing to are shown below in millions 
net sales for year ended december  decrease in shipments  including changes in product mix increase in selling prices  including changes in customer mix decrease due to foreign currency impact net sales for year ended december  increase in shipments  including changes in product mix increase in selling prices  including changes in customer mix decrease due to foreign currency impact net sales for year ended december  real estate development segment the revenue of million for the real estate development segment represents the rental of the office building  which was constructed by foundry park i 
the building was completed in late  and we began recognizing rental revenue in january segment operating profit newmarket evaluates the performance of the petroleum additives business and the real estate development business based on segment operating profit 
newmarket services departmental and other expenses are billed to newmarket and each subsidiary pursuant to services agreements between the companies 
depreciation on segment property  plant  and equipment  as well as amortization of segment intangible assets is included in the segment operating profit 
the all other category includes the continuing operations of the tel business primarily sales of tel in north america  as well as certain contract manufacturing ethyl provides to afton and to third parties 
the table below reports operating profit by segment for the last three years 
segment operating profit in millions of dollars petroleum additives real estate development all other petroleum additives the petroleum additives operating profit increased million when comparing and the operating profit margin was for and for when compared to operating profit levels  the results are higher across the lubricant additives product lines  but lower across the fuel additives product lines 
substantially increased product shipments and somewhat higher selling prices  as well as the benefit of the polartech acquisition  as discussed in the revenue section above  were significant favorable factors in the operating profit when compared to partially offsetting these favorable factors on operating profit  were unfavorable impacts from margin compression  as well as planned additional spending in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
while operating profit improved in over  the operating profit margin was unfavorable when comparing the two years 
the lower operating profit margin reflects increased raw material costs and less favorable product mix resulting from the decrease of shipments of certain high margin products 
in response to the increase of raw material costs during  we have been implementing selling price increases 

table of contents the petroleum additives operating profit increased million when comparing and the operating profit margin of for compares to for the results included a gain of million resulting from a legal settlement related to raw materials 
the results are significantly higher across all product lines 
the most significant factors when comparing operating profit and the operating profit margins between and were higher selling prices  as discussed in the revenue section above  and lower raw material costs 
while partially offset by selling price reductions made during  the overall increase in selling prices for is the result of actions taken throughout to raise selling prices in response to the then increasing raw material costs 
the key unfavorable factor in operating profit results between and was lower product shipments  also discussed in the revenue section 
during the second half of  we experienced increasing raw material costs and tightening in the availability of certain raw materials 
finally  our selling  general  and administrative expenses sg a  together with research  development  and testing expenses r d  were million  or  higher in than  and million  or  higher in than in  sg a increased approximately million  or  over levels 
the increase was primarily the result of certain growth related costs  largely reflecting the inclusion of the polartech operations in  as well as higher personnel related costs and professional fees 
sg a was approximately million  or  lower when comparing and the decrease resulted primarily from favorable foreign currency  partially offset by higher personnel related costs 
total r d for petroleum additives was million in  million in  and million in we continue to invest in sg a and r d to support our customers programs and to develop the technology required to remain a leader in this industry 
we expect this to continue for the foreseeable future 
r d related to new products and processes was million in  million in  and million in all of our r d was related to the petroleum additives segment 
real estate development operating profit for the real estate development segment was million for  compared to a loss of million for during  the office building was under construction resulting in no rental revenue and limited non capital expenses 
the following discussion references certain captions on the consolidated statements of income 
interest and financing expenses interest and financing expenses were million in  million in  and million in the increase in interest and financing expenses between and was primarily related to the mortgage loan on the foundry park i office building  as well as higher average outstanding debt on the revolving credit facility during prior to obtaining the mortgage loan in january  the interest and financing expenses for the construction phase of the office building were capitalized 
the small decrease in interest and financing expenses between and resulted primarily from lower average debt between the two years  as we had no drawn debt on the revolving credit facility during most of the lower debt was partially offset by slightly higher interest rates and higher amortization of deferred financing costs in due to the cost related to increased commitment levels achieved on the revolving credit facility 
other expense income  net other expense income  net was million expense in  million expense in  and million income in the and amounts primarily represent the loss on an interest rate swap which is recorded at fair value 
see note for additional information on the interest rate swap

table of contents benefit of higher income in foreign jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
the and effective income tax rates include a substantial benefit from the domestic manufacturing tax deduction 
the effective tax rate in each year reflects certain foreign and other tax benefits 
see note for further details on income taxes 
the increase in income before income tax expense between and resulted in an increase in tax expense of million 
this was partially offset by a reduction in tax expense of million due to the lower effective tax rate in compared to the increase in income before income tax expense between and resulted in an increase in tax expense of million 
the remaining change in income tax expense resulted from the higher effective tax rate  which primarily reflects the higher proportion of domestic earnings in  which are subject to both us federal and state income taxes 
our deferred taxes are in a net asset position 
based on current forecast operating plans and historical profitability  we believe that we will recover nearly the full benefit of our deferred tax assets and have  therefore  recorded an immaterial valuation allowance at a foreign subsidiary 
cash flows discussion we generated cash from operating activities of million in  million in  and million in during  we utilized the million of cash generated from operations and million of cash on hand  along with the borrowing of million under the mortgage loan for foundry park i and million under the revolving credit facility to fund several key initiatives 
these initiatives included repaying the foundry park i construction loan of million 
we also funded the acquisition of polartech for million  funded capital expenses of million  repurchased million of our common stock  paid million of dividends on our common stock  made a net deposit of million related to the goldman sachs interest rate swap  paid million for debt issuance costs  and made a net payment of million for settlements under the mortgage loan interest rate swap 
further information on the goldman sachs and mortgage loan interest rate swaps is in note these cash flows included an unfavorable foreign currency impact on cash of million 
cash flows from operating activities included a decrease of million resulting from higher working capital requirements and payments of million for our pension and postretirement plans 
during  we used the cash generated from operations  along with million of draws under the foundry park i construction loan and million from a net return of funds for the deposit related to an interest rate lock agreement to fund million of capital expenditures  payoff the outstanding balance of million on the revolving credit agreement  and make a net deposit of million related to the goldman sachs interest rate swap 
we also paid dividends on our common stock of million 
these items  including a favorable fluctuation in foreign currency rates of million  resulted in an increase of million in cash and cash equivalents 
cash flows from operating activities included an increase of million resulting from lower working capital requirements  as well as payments of million for our pension and postretirement plans 
as of december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit agreement and had made draws of million under the foundry park i construction loan 
we used these borrowings  as well as cash provided from operating activities to fund million of capital expenditures  million for repurchase of our common stock  million for dividends on our common stock  and million for the acquisition of a business 
in addition  we also funded million cash for the net deposit on an interest rate lock agreement 
our book overdraft decreased million 
these items  combined with an unfavorable foreign exchange effect on cash of million  resulted in a decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million 
cash flows from operating activities included a decrease of million due to higher working capital requirements  payments of million to fund our pension and postretirement plans  and proceeds of million for a legal settlement related to raw materials 
the higher working capital requirements during the year primarily reflected a reduction in outstanding accounts payable at the end of  as well as higher inventory costs during the year 

table of contents we expect that cash from operations  together with borrowing available under our senior credit facility  will continue to be sufficient to cover our operating expenses and planned capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
financial position and liquidity cash at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million at the end of at both december  and december   we had a book overdraft for some of our disbursement cash accounts 
a book overdraft represents disbursements that have not cleared the bank accounts at the end of the reporting period 
we transfer cash on an as needed basis to fund these items as they clear the bank in subsequent periods 
debt senior notes the senior notes are our senior unsecured obligations and are jointly and severally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by all of our existing and future owned by newmarket domestic restricted subsidiaries 
we incurred financing costs of approximately million in related to the senior notes  which are being amortized over ten years 
the senior notes and the subsidiary guarantees rank effectively junior to all of our and the guarantors existing and future secured indebtedness  including any borrowings under the senior credit facility described below  equal in right of payment with any of our and the guarantors existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness  and senior in right of payment to any of our and the guarantors existing and future subordinated indebtedness 
the indenture governing the senior notes contains covenants that  among other things  limit our ability and the ability of our restricted subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness  create liens  pay dividends or repurchase capital stock  make certain investments  sell assets or consolidate or merge with or into other companies  and engage in transactions with affiliates 
the more restrictive and significant of the covenants under the indenture include a minimum fixed charge ratio of  as well as a limitation on restricted payments  as defined in the indenture 
our fixed charge coverage ratio was at december  and at december  in addition  we would have been permitted to make additional restricted payments in the amount of approximately million at december  and million at december  in january  we obtained consents from the holders of the senior notes to modify the formula for calculating the capacity under the senior notes to make certain restricted payments 
had the consent been effective at year end  we would have been permitted to make additional restricted payments in the amount of approximately million at december  we were in compliance with all covenants under the indenture governing the senior notes as of december  and december  
table of contents senior credit facility on november   we entered into a credit agreement credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a million  multicurrency revolving credit facility  with a million sublimit for multicurrency borrowings  a million sublimit for letters of credit  and a million sublimit for swingline loans 
the credit agreement includes an expansion feature  which allows us  subject to certain conditions  to request to increase the aggregate amount of the revolving credit facility or obtain incremental term loans in an amount up to million 
we used the proceeds from the credit agreement to pay off the outstanding balance of million on our previous revolving credit agreement 
our previous revolving credit agreement was terminated on november  at december   we had outstanding letters of credit of million and million borrowed  resulting in the unused portion of the senior credit facility amounting to million 
for further information on the outstanding letters of credit  see note we paid financing costs in of approximately million related to this agreement and carried over deferred financing costs from our previous revolving credit agreement of approximately thousand  resulting in total deferred financing costs of million  which we are amortizing over the term of the credit agreement 
the obligations under the credit agreement are unsecured and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by newmarket and the subsidiary guarantors 
the revolving credit facility matures on november  borrowing made under the revolving credit facility bear interest at an annual rate equal to  at our election  either the abr plus the applicable rate solely in the case of loans denominated in us dollars to newmarket or the adjusted libo rate plus the applicable rate 
abr is the greatest of i the rate of interest publicly announced by the administrative agent as its prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate from time to time plus or iii the adjusted libo rate for a one month interest period plus 
the adjusted libo rate means the rate at which eurocurrency deposits in the london interbank market for certain periods as selected by newmarket are quoted  as adjusted for statutory reserve requirements for eurocurrency liabilities and other applicable mandatory costs 
depending on our leverage ratio  the applicable rate ranges from to for loans bearing interest based on the abr and from to for loans bearing interest based on the adjusted libo rate 
at december   the applicable rate was for loans bearing interest based on the abr and for loans bearing interest based on the adjusted libo rate 
our average interest rate under the credit agreement was during  while the combined average interest rate under both revolving credit agreements in effect during was 
at december   the interest rate was 
the credit agreement contains financial covenants that require newmarket to maintain a consolidated leverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement of no more than to and a consolidated interest coverage ratio as defined in the credit agreement of no less than to  as of the end of each fiscal quarter ending on and after december  at december   the leverage ratio was and the interest ratio was 
we were in compliance with all covenants under the credit agreement at december  mortgage loan agreement on january   foundry park i entered into a mortgage loan agreement in the amount of million 
the loan  which is collateralized by the foundry park i office building  is for a period of five years  with two thirteen month extension options 
newmarket corporation is fully guaranteeing the loan 
the mortgage loan bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus a margin of basis points  with a minimum libor of basis points 
at december   the interest rate was 
principal payments on the loan are being made monthly based on a year amortization schedule  with all remaining amounts due in five years  unless we exercise the extension options 
we incurred financing costs of million related to the mortgage loan  which are being amortized over five years 
concurrently with the closing of the mortgage loan  foundry park i obtained an interest rate swap to effectively convert the variable interest rate in the loan to a fixed interest rate by setting libor at for five years 
further information on the interest rate swap is in note 
table of contents construction loan agreement foundry park i and newmarket corporation entered into a construction loan agreement with a group of banks on august  to borrow up to million to fund the development and construction of an office building 
the construction loan bore interest at libor plus a margin of basis points 
the term of the loan was for a period of months and was unconditionally guaranteed by newmarket corporation 
no principal reduction payment became due during the construction period 
as a condition of the construction loan and concurrently with the closing of the loan  foundry park i also obtained interest rate risk protection in the form of an interest rate swap 
see note on january   we paid off the outstanding balance of million of the construction loan with proceeds of million from the mortgage loan agreement discussed above and cash on hand of million 
other borrowings one of our subsidiaries in india has a short term line of credit of million rupees for working capital purposes 
the average interest rate was approximately during and at december  the outstanding balance of million at december  is due during we had combined current and noncurrent long term debt of million at december  and million at december  the decrease in debt resulted from the payment of the outstanding balance of million on the construction loan  which was partially offset by net borrowings of million on the mortgage loan  million on the revolving credit facility  and million under the line of credit of our subsidiary in india 
in addition  during  we also paid thousand on our capital lease obligations 
as a percentage of total capitalization total debt and shareholders equity  our total debt decreased from at the end of to at the end of the change in the percentage was primarily the result of the increase in shareholders equity and the decrease in debt 
the increase in shareholders equity reflects our earnings  partially offset by the impact of dividend payments and the stock repurchase program 
normally  we repay long term debt with cash from operations or refinancing activities 
working capital at december   we had working capital of million  resulting in a current ratio of to our working capital at year end was million resulting in a current ratio of to the change in the working capital ratio primarily reflects lower cash levels and prepaid expenses  as well as higher accounts payable at december  these were offset by higher accounts receivable and inventories  as well as lower current portion of long term debt at december  the decrease in prepaid expenses reflects a reduction of prepaid taxes on intercompany profit in inventory  while the fluctuation in accounts payable results from normal differences in timing of payments and increased inventory purchases 
the increase in inventories primarily reflects higher quantities at certain locations in response to demand for our products 
the increase in accounts receivables primarily reflects higher sales levels when comparing fourth quarter and fourth quarter  as well as an increase in our domestic tax receivable position 
the decrease in the current portion of long term debt resulted from the january payment of the construction loan and subsequent entry into the mortgage loan 
the changes in the working capital components include a foreign currency impact  as well as the impact of polartech since the march acquisition 
capital expenditures we expect capital expenditures to be approximately million to million in we expect to continue to finance this capital spending through cash provided from operations  together with borrowing available under our senior credit facility 
environmental expenses we spent approximately million in and million in both and for ongoing environmental operating and clean up costs  excluding depreciation of previously capitalized expenditures 
these environmental 
table of contents operating and clean up expenses are included in cost of goods sold 
further  we expect to continue to fund these costs through cash provided by operations

purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business are excluded from the above table 
any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders are reflected in our consolidated balance sheets as accounts payable or accrued expenses 
d these represent other long term liability amounts reflected in our consolidated balance sheets that have known payment streams 
amounts include environmental liabilities  including asset retirement obligations  as well as contributions associated with pension and postretirement benefit plans 
amounts accrued for the potential exposure with respect to litigation  claims  and assessments are not included in the table above 
pension and postretirement benefit plans our us and foreign benefit plans are discussed separately below 
our us pension and postretirement plans are similar and therefore  the information discussed below applies to all of our us benefit plans 
our foreign plans are quite diverse  and the actual assumptions used by the various foreign plans are based upon the circumstances of each particular country and retirement plan 
the discussion below surrounding our foreign retirement benefits focuses only on our pension plan in the united kingdom uk which represents the majority of the impact on our financial statements from foreign pension plans 
we use a december measurement date to determine our pension and postretirement expenses and related financial disclosure information 
additional information on our pension and postretirement plans is in note us pension and postretirement benefit plans the following information applies to our us pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the average remaining service period of active participants for our us plans is years  while the average remaining life expectancy of inactive participants is years 
we utilize the optional combined mortality tables for males and females based on the rp mortality tables projected with scale aa as published by the irs on february  in determining the impact of the us benefit plans on our financial statements 

table of contents investment return and asset allocation we periodically review our assumptions for the long term expected return on pension plan assets 
as part of the review and to develop expected rates of return  we considered a stochastic analysis of expected returns based on the us plans asset allocation as of both january  and january  this forecast reflects our expected long term rates of return for each significant asset class or economic indicator 
as of january   the expected rates were for us large cap stocks  for us long term corporate bonds  and for inflation 
the range of returns developed relies both on forecasts and on broad market historical benchmarks for expected return  correlation  and volatility for each asset class 
our asset allocation is predominantly weighted toward equities 
through our ongoing monitoring of our investments  we have determined that we should maintain the expected long term rate of return for our us plans at at december  an actuarial gain  where the actual return was higher than the expected return  occurred during and resulting in the actual investment return being higher than the expected return for all of our us plans by approximately million in and million in an actuarial loss  where the actual return was lower than the expected return  occurred during resulting in the actual investment return being approximately million lower than the expected return for all of our us pension plans 
this is consistent with the steep decline in the global stock markets during investment gains and losses enter earnings on an amortized basis over a period of years so that the investment losses caused an increase in expense of approximately million in  as well as an expected million increase in expense in we expect that there will be continued volatility in pension expense as actual investment returns vary from the expected return  but we continue to believe the potential long term benefits justify the risk premium for equity investments 
pension expense and the retiree medical portion of postretirement expense are sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets 
for example  decreasing the expected rate of return by basis points to for pension assets and for postretirement benefit assets while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our us pension and postretirement plans by approximately thousand 
similarly  a basis point increase in the expected rate of return to for pension assets and for postretirement benefit assets while holding other assumptions constant would reduce forecasted pension and postretirement expense by approximately thousand 
discount rate assumption we utilize a proprietary model maintained by our actuarial consultant in developing the discount rate assumption 
the model determines the single effective discount rate for a unique hypothetical portfolio constructed from investment grade bonds that  in aggregate  match the projected cash flows of each of our retirement plans 
our discount rate is developed based on the hypothetical portfolio on the last day of december 
the discount rate at december  was for all plans 
pension and postretirement benefit expense is also sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
for example  decreasing the discount rate by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our us pension and postretirement benefit plans by approximately thousand 
a basis point increase in the discount rate to would reduce forecasted pension and postretirement benefit expense by approximately thousand 
rate of projected compensation increase we have decreased our rate of projected compensation increase at december  from to 
the rate assumption was based on an analysis of our projected compensation increases for the foreseeable future 
liquidity cash contribution requirements to the pension plan are sensitive to changes in assumed interest rates and investment gains or losses in the same manner as pension expense 
we expect our aggregate cash contributions  before income taxes  to the us pension plans will be approximately million in we expect our contributions to the postretirement benefit plans will be approximately million 

table of contents other assumptions during  we reviewed our assumption for the health care cost trend rate 
based on actual cost experience  we restarted our overall assumption for health care cost increases at  scaling down to by we maintained this health care cost trend assumption for resulting in an assumed rate of for and for the assumption includes temporarily higher cost increases for our retiree prescription drug coverage 
at december   our expected long term rate of return on our postretirement plans was 
this rate varies from the pension rate of primarily because of the difference in investment of assets 
the assets of the postretirement plan are held in an insurance contract  which results in a lower assumed rate of investment return 
foreign pension benefit plans as discussed above  our foreign pension plans are quite diverse 
the following information applies only to our uk pension plan  which represents the majority of the impact on our financial statements from our foreign pension plans 
the average remaining service period for our uk plan is years  while the average remaining life expectancy is years 
we utilize pa mortality tables which allow for future medium cohort projected improvements in life expectancy with a minimum per year improvement and a year age rating based on the membership of the plan  in determining the impact of the uk pension plans on our financial statements 
investment return assumptions and asset allocation we periodically review our assumptions for the long term expected return on the uk pension plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return is based on both the asset allocation  as well as yields available in the uk markets 
the target asset allocation in the uk is to be invested in equities  in a mixture of government and corporate bonds  and in a pooled investment property fund  although the actual allocation at the end of was in equities  in government and corporate bonds  and in a pooled investment property fund 
based on the actual asset allocation and the expected yields available in the uk markets  the expected long term rate of return for the uk pension plan was at december  an actuarial gain occurred during as the actual investment return exceeded the expected investment return in by approximately million for our uk pension plan 
this compares to an actuarial gain of million in and an actuarial loss of million in investment gains and losses enter earnings on an amortized basis resulting in increased expense of approximately million in  as well as an expected thousand increased expense in we expect that there will be continued volatility in pension expense as actual investment returns vary from the expected return  but we continue to believe the potential benefits justify the risk premium for the target asset allocation 
pension expense is sensitive to changes in the expected return on assets 
for example  decreasing the expected rate of return by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our uk pension plan by approximately thousand 
similarly  a basis point increase in the expected rate of return to while holding other assumptions constant would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 
discount rate assumption we utilize a yield curve based on aa rated corporate bond yields constructed from iboxx indices in developing a discount rate assumption extrapolated at longer terms based on the corresponding swap yield curve 
the yield appropriate to the duration of the uk plan liabilities is then used 
the discount rate at december  was 
pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the discount rate 
for example  decreasing the discount rate by basis points to while holding other assumptions constant would increase the forecasted expense for our uk pension plans by approximately thousand 
a basis point increase in the discount rate to would reduce forecasted pension expense by approximately thousand 

table of contents rate of projected compensation increase we have increased our rate of projected compensation increase at december  to from 
the rate assumption was based on an analysis of our projected compensation increases for the foreseeable future 
liquidity cash contribution requirements to the uk pension plan are sensitive to changes in assumed interest rates in the same manner as pension expense 
we expect our aggregate uk cash contributions  before income taxes  will be approximately million in outlook we begin with high confidence in our business  as proved to be a record setting year 
we believe the fundamentals of how we run our business a safety first culture  customer focused solutions  technology driven product offerings  world class supply chain capability  and a regional organizational structure to better understand our customers needs will continue to pay dividends to all of our stakeholders 
we expect to be a more profitable year than  as we project an increase in both revenue and net income 
over the past several years  we have made significant investments to expand our capabilities around the globe 
these investments have been in people  research centers  and production capacity 
we intend to use these new capabilities to improve our ability to deliver the goods and service that our customers value and to expand our business and profits 
in summary  we expect the business practices that have produced the outstanding results of the past two years will continue next year 
we expect that the macro business environment in which we operate will improve as the world economies continue to strengthen 
our business continues to generate significant amounts of cash beyond what is necessary for the expansion and growth of our current product lines 
we regularly review the many internal opportunities which we have to utilize this cash  both from a geographical and product line point of view 
we have increased our efforts in investigating potential acquisitions as both a use for this cash and to generate shareholder value 
our primary focus in the acquisition area remains on the petroleum additives industry 
it is our view that this industry will provide the greatest opportunity for a good return on our investment while minimizing risk 
we remain focused on this strategy and will evaluate any future opportunities 
nonetheless  we are patient in this pursuit and intend to make the right acquisition when the opportunity arises 
until an acquisition materializes  we will build cash on our balance sheet and will continue to evaluate all alternative uses of that cash to enhance shareholder value  including stock repurchases and dividends 
critical accounting policies and estimates it is our goal to clearly present our financial information in a manner that enhances the understanding of our sources of earnings and cash flows  as well as our financial condition 
we do this by including the information required by the sec  as well as additional information that gives further insight into our financial operations 
our financial report includes a discussion of our accounting principles  as well as methods and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we believe these discussions and statements fairly represent the financial position and operating results of our company 
the purpose of this portion of our discussion is to further emphasize some of the more critical areas where a significant change in facts and circumstances in our operating and financial environment could cause a change in reported financial results 
intangibles net of amortization and goodwill we have certain identifiable intangibles  as well as goodwill  amounting to million at year end that are discussed in note these intangibles relate to our petroleum additives business and  except for the goodwill  are being amortized over periods with up to approximately twenty years of remaining life 
we continue to assess 
table of contents the market related to these intangibles  as well as their specific values  and have concluded the values and amortization periods are appropriate 
we also evaluate these intangibles for any potential impairment when significant events or circumstances occur that might impair the value of these assets 
these evaluations continue to support the value at which these identifiable intangibles are carried on our financial statements 
in addition  none of our reporting units with goodwill is at risk of failing the goodwill impairment test 
however  if conditions were to substantially deteriorate in the petroleum additives market  it could possibly cause a reduction in the periods of this amortization charge or result in a noncash write off of a portion of the intangibles carrying value 
a reduction in the amortization period would have no effect on cash flows 
we do not anticipate such a change in the market conditions 
environmental and legal proceedings we have made disclosure of our environmental matters in item of this annual report on form k  as well as in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe our environmental accruals are appropriate for the exposures and regulatory guidelines under which we currently operate 
while we currently do not anticipate significant changes to the many factors that could impact our environmental requirements  we continue to keep our accruals consistent with these requirements as they change 
also  as noted in the discussion of legal proceedings in item of this annual report on form k  while it is not possible to predict or determine with certainty the outcome of any legal proceeding  it is our opinion  based on our current knowledge  that we will not experience any material adverse effects on our results of operations or financial condition as a result of any pending or threatened proceeding 
pension plans and other postretirement benefits we use assumptions to record the impact of the pension and postretirement plans in the financial statements 
these assumptions include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase  and health care cost trend rate 
a change in any one of these assumptions could result in different results for the plans 
we develop these assumptions after considering available information that we deem relevant 
information is provided on the pension and postretirement plans in note in addition  further disclosure on the effect of changes in these assumptions is provided in the financial position and liquidity section of item income taxes we file consolidated us federal and state income tax returns  as well as individual foreign income tax returns  under which assumptions may be made to determine the deductibility of certain costs 
we make estimates related to the impact of tax positions taken on our financial statements when we believe the tax position is likely to be upheld on audit 
in addition  we make certain assumptions in the determination of the estimated future recovery of deferred tax assets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to many market risk factors  including fluctuations in interest and foreign currency rates  as well as changes in the cost of raw materials and marketable security prices 
these risk factors may affect our results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
we manage these risks through regular operating and financing methods  including the use of derivative financial instruments 
when we have derivative instruments  they are with major financial institutions and are not for speculative or trading purposes 
also  as part of our financial risk management  we regularly review significant contracts for embedded derivatives and record them in accordance with accounting standards 

table of contents the following analysis presents the effect on our earnings  cash flows  and financial position as if the hypothetical changes in market risk factors occurred at year end we analyzed only the potential impacts of our hypothetical assumptions 
this analysis does not consider other possible effects that could impact our business 
interest rate risk at december   we had total debt of million 
of the total debt  million is at fixed rates 
there was no interest rate risk at the end of the year associated with the fixed rate debt 
at year end  we had million of outstanding variable rate debt under our revolving credit facility 
holding all other variables constant  if the variable portion of the interest rate on the revolving credit facility hypothetically increased approximately basis points  the effect on our earnings and cash flows would have been higher interest expense of approximately thousand 
substantially  the remaining amount of debt represents the outstanding balance of the mortgage loan  which bears interest at a variable rate of libor plus a margin of basis points 
concurrently with the closing of the mortgage loan  foundry park i obtained an interest rate swap to effectively convert the variable interest rate of the loan to a fixed interest rate by setting libor at for five years 
accordingly  in combination  there is no interest rate risk associated with the mortgage loan and related interest rate swap  other than the change in the value of the interest rate swap due to changes in the yield curve 
the fair value amounted to a liability of million at december  any change in fair value is recognized immediately in accumulated other comprehensive income  to the degree of effectiveness of the swap 
with other variables held constant  a hypothetical basis point adverse parallel shift in the libor yield curve would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the fair value liability of the mortgage loan interest rate swap at december  we recorded the goldman sachs interest rate swap at fair value  which amounted to a liability of million at december  any change in fair value is recognized immediately in earnings 
with other variables held constant  a hypothetical basis point adverse parallel shift in the libor yield curve would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the liability fair value of the interest rate swap with goldman sachs 
see note for further information 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  holding all other variables constant  would have resulted in a change of million in fair value of our debt at year end foreign currency risk we sell to customers in foreign markets through our foreign subsidiaries  as well as through export sales from the united states 
these transactions are often denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our primary currency exposures are the european union euro  british pound sterling  japanese yen  and canadian dollar 
we sometimes enter into forward contracts as hedges to minimize the fluctuation of intercompany accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
at december   we had no outstanding forward contracts 
raw material price risk we utilize a variety of raw materials in the manufacture of our products  including base oil  polyisobutylene  antioxidants  alcohols  solvents  sulfonates  friction modifiers  olefins and copolymers 
our profitability is sensitive to changes in the costs of these materials caused by changes in supply  demand  or other market conditions  over which we have little or no control 
if we experience sudden or sharp increases in the cost of our raw materials  we may not be able to pass on these increases in whole or in part to our customers 
political and economic conditions in the middle east and latin america have caused and may continue to cause the cost of our raw materials to fluctuate 
war  armed hostilities  terrorist acts  civil unrest or other incidents may also cause a sudden or sharp increase in the cost of our raw materials 
if we cannot pass on to our customers any future increases in raw material costs in the form of price increases for our products  there will be a negative impact on operating profit
