item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a growth oriented delaware limited partnership organized by anadarko to own  operate  acquire and develop midstream energy assets 
we currently operate in east and west texas  the rocky mountains colorado  utah and wyoming and the mid continent kansas and oklahoma and are engaged in the business of gathering  processing  compressing  treating and transporting natural gas  condensate  ngls and crude oil for anadarko and third party producers and customers 
operating and financial highlights significant financial and operational highlights during the year ended december  include the following during  we issued an aggregate  common units in public offerings  generating net proceeds of million  including the general partner s proportionate capital contributions to maintain its general partner interest 
net proceeds from these offerings were used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility 
during  we completed several acquisitions  including the august acquisition of the wattenberg gathering system and fort lupton processing plant  the january acquisition of the granger gathering system  which includes two cryogenic trains  one refrigeration train  one fractionation train and ancillary equipment  and the september acquisition of a interest in white cliffs 
our strong operating cash flows  combined with a focus on cost reduction and capital spending discipline  enabled us to raise our distribution to per unit for the fourth quarter of this represents a increase over the distribution for the third quarter of  a increase over the distribution for the fourth quarter of and our seventh consecutive quarterly increase 
gross margin total revenues less cost of product attributable to western gas partners  lp averaged per mcf for the year ended december   representing a increase compared to the year ended december  the increase in gross margin per mcf for the year ended december  is primarily due to higher margins at the wattenberg  granger and hilight systems and the change in throughput mix within our portfolio 
throughput attributable to western gas partners  lp totaled  mmcf d for the year ended december   representing a decrease compared to the same period in the throughput decrease is primarily due to lower volumes at the pinnacle  haley  dew and hugoton systems due to natural production declines and low drilling activity 
these declines were partially offset by increased throughput at the chipeta  granger and wattenberg systems  driven by favorable producer economics in these areas due to the relatively high liquid content of the gas volumes produced 
descriptions of acquisitions since our inception and our presentation of assets acquired are included under the caption acquisitions under items and of this annual report 

table of contents our operations the following discussion analyzes our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements  and the notes thereto  included in item of this annual report 
for ease of reference  we refer to the historical financial results of the partnership assets prior to our acquisitions as being our historical financial results 
unless the context otherwise requires  references to we  us  our  the partnership or western gas partners are intended to refer i to the business and operations of agc and pgt from their inception through the closing date of our initial public offering and ii to western gas partners  lp and its subsidiaries thereafter  combined with a the business and operations of migc  the powder river assets and the granger assets since august   b the business and operations of the chipeta assets and wattenberg assets since august   and c the financial results of awc  including the interest in white cliffs  since january  anadarko or parent refers to anadarko petroleum corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries  excluding the partnership and the general partner 
affiliates refers to wholly owned and partially owned subsidiaries of anadarko  excluding the partnership  and also refers to fort union and white cliffs 
references to the partnership assets refer collectively to the initial assets  powder river assets  chipeta assets  granger assets  wattenberg assets and the white cliffs investment 
unless otherwise noted  references to periods prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets and similar phrases refer to periods prior to may with respect to the initial assets  periods prior to december with respect to the powder river assets  periods prior to july with respect to the chipeta assets  periods prior to january with respect to the granger assets  periods prior to july with respect to the wattenberg assets  and periods prior to september with respect to the white cliffs investment 
unless otherwise noted  references to periods subsequent to our acquisition of the partnership assets and similar phrases refer to periods including and subsequent to may with respect to the initial assets  periods including and subsequent to december with respect to the powder river assets  periods including and subsequent to july with respect to the chipeta assets  periods including and subsequent to january with respect to the granger assets  periods including and subsequent to july with respect to the wattenberg assets  and periods including and subsequent to september with respect to the white cliffs investment 
our results are driven primarily by the volumes of natural gas and ngls we gather  process  treat or transport through our systems 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenues and of our throughput was attributable to transactions with anadarko 
in our gathering operations  we contract with producers and customers to gather natural gas from individual wells located near our gathering systems 
we connect wells to gathering lines through which natural gas may be compressed and delivered to a processing plant  treating facility or downstream pipeline  and ultimately to end users 
we also treat a significant portion of the natural gas that we gather so that it will satisfy required specifications for pipeline transportation 
we received significant dedications from our largest customer  anadarko  solely with respect to the gathering systems connected to the wattenberg system and the gathering systems included in our initial assets 
specifically  anadarko has dedicated to us all of the natural gas production it owns or controls from i wells that are currently connected to such gathering systems  and ii additional wells that are drilled within one mile of wells connected to such gathering systems  as those systems currently exist and as they are expanded to connect additional wells in the future 
as a result  this dedication will continue to expand as long as additional wells are connected to these gathering systems 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross margin was attributed to fee based contracts  under which a fixed fee is received based on the volume and thermal content of the natural gas we gather  process  treat or transport 
this type of contract provides us with a relatively stable revenue stream that is not subject to direct commodity price risk  except to the extent that we retain and sell drip condensate that is recovered during the gathering of natural gas from the wellhead 
fee based gross margin includes equity income from our interests in fort union and white cliffs 
certain of our fee based contracts contain keep whole provisions 
for the year ended december   approximately of our gross margin was attributed to percent of proceeds and keep whole contracts  pursuant to which we have commodity price exposure  including gross margin attributable to condensate sales 
we have fixed price swap agreements with anadarko to manage the commodity price risk inherent in substantially all of our percent of proceeds and keep whole contracts 
see note transactions with affiliates of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 

table of contents we also have indirect exposure to commodity price risk in that persistent low natural gas prices have caused and may continue to cause our current or potential customers to delay drilling or shut in production in certain areas  which would reduce the volumes of natural gas available for our systems 
we also bear a limited degree of commodity price risk through settlement of natural gas imbalances 
please read item a of this annual report 
as a result of our initial public offering and subsequent acquisitions from anadarko  the results of operations  financial position and cash flows may vary significantly for  and as compared to future periods 
please see the caption items affecting the comparability of our financial results  set forth below in this item how we evaluate our operations our management relies on certain financial and operational metrics to analyze our performance 
these metrics are significant factors in assessing our operating results and profitability and include throughput  gross margin  operating and maintenance expenses  general and administrative expenses  adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow 
throughput 
throughput is the most important operational variable in assessing our ability to generate revenues 
in order to maintain or increase throughput on our gathering and processing systems  we must connect additional wells to our systems 
our success in maintaining or increasing throughput is impacted by successful drilling of new wells by producers that are dedicated to our systems  recompletions of existing wells connected to our systems  our ability to secure volumes from new wells drilled on non dedicated acreage and our ability to attract natural gas volumes currently gathered  processed or treated by our competitors 
during the year ended december   we added receipt points to our systems with initial throughput of approximately mmcf d per receipt point 
gross margin 
we define gross margin as total revenues less cost of product 
we consider gross margin to provide information useful in assessing our results of operations and our ability to internally fund capital expenditures and to service or incur additional debt 
cost of product expenses include i costs associated with the purchase of natural gas and ngls pursuant to our percent of proceeds and keep whole processing contracts  ii costs associated with the valuation of our gas imbalances  iii costs associated with our obligations under certain contracts to redeliver a volume of natural gas to shippers  which is thermally equivalent to condensate retained by us and sold to third parties  and iv costs associated with our fuel tracking mechanism  which tracks the difference between actual fuel usage and loss  and amounts recovered for estimated fuel usage and loss pursuant to our contracts 
these expenses are subject to variability  although our exposure to commodity price risk attributable to purchases and sales of natural gas  condensate and ngls is mitigated through our commodity price swap agreements with anadarko 
operating and maintenance expenses 
we monitor operating and maintenance expenses to assess the impact of such costs on the profitability of our assets and to evaluate the overall efficiency of our operations 
operation and maintenance expenses include  among other things  field labor  insurance  repair and maintenance  equipment rentals  contract services  utility costs and services provided to us or on our behalf 
for periods commencing on and subsequent to our acquisition of the partnership assets  certain of these expenses are incurred under and governed by our services and secondment agreement with anadarko 

table of contents general and administrative expenses 
to help ensure the appropriateness of our general and administrative expenses and maximize our cash available for distribution  we monitor such expenses through comparison to prior periods  the annual budget approved by our general partner s board of directors  as well as to general and administrative expenses incurred by similar midstream companies 
general and administrative expenses for periods prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets include reimbursements attributable to costs incurred by anadarko and the general partner on our behalf and allocations of general and administrative costs by anadarko and the general partner to us 
for these periods  anadarko received compensation or reimbursement through a management services fee 
for periods subsequent to our acquisition of the partnership assets  anadarko is no longer compensated for corporate services through a management services fee 
instead  we reimburse anadarko for general and administrative expenses it and the general partner incur on our behalf pursuant to the terms of our omnibus agreement with anadarko 
amounts required to be reimbursed to anadarko under the omnibus agreement include those expenses attributable to our status as a publicly traded partnership  such as the following expenses associated with annual and quarterly reporting  tax return and schedule k preparation and distribution expenses  expenses associated with listing on the new york stock exchange  and independent auditor fees  legal expenses  investor relations expenses  director fees  and registrar and transfer agent fees 
in addition to the above  pursuant to the terms of the omnibus agreement with anadarko  we are required to reimburse anadarko for allocable general and administrative expenses 
the amount required to be reimbursed by us to anadarko for certain allocated general and administrative expenses was capped at million for the year ended december  the cap contained in the omnibus agreement expired on december  and did not apply to incremental general and administrative expenses incurred by or allocated to us as a result of being a separate publicly traded entity 
subsequent to december   general and administrative expenses allocated to us will be determined by anadarko in its reasonable discretion  in accordance with the partnership agreement and the omnibus agreement 
public company expenses that were not subject to the cap contained in the omnibus agreement  excluding equity based compensation  were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
see note transactions with affiliates omnibus agreement of the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report 
adjusted ebitda 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss attributable to western gas partners  lp  plus distributions from equity investees  non cash equity based compensation expense  expense in excess of the omnibus cap  interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation  amortization and impairments  and other expense  less income from equity investments  interest income  income tax benefit  other income and other nonrecurring adjustments that are not settled in cash 
we believe that the presentation of adjusted ebitda provides information useful to investors in assessing our financial condition and results of operations and that adjusted ebitda is a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service debt  fund capital expenditures and make distributions 
adjusted ebitda is a supplemental financial measure that management and external users of our consolidated financial statements  such as industry analysts  investors  commercial banks and rating agencies  use to assess the following  among other measures our operating performance as compared to other publicly traded partnerships in the midstream energy industry  without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  the ability of our assets to generate cash flow to make distributions  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the returns on investment of various investment opportunities 

table of contents distributable cash flow 
we define distributable cash flow as adjusted ebitda  plus interest income  less net cash paid for interest expense  maintenance capital expenditures  and income taxes 
we compare distributable cash flow to the cash distributions we expect to pay our unitholders 
using this measure  management can quickly compute the coverage ratio of estimated cash flows to planned cash distributions 
we believe this measure is useful to investors because this measurement is used by many companies  analysts and others in the industry as a performance measurement tool to evaluate our operating and financial performance and compare it with the performance of other publicly traded partnerships 
distributable cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income  earnings per unit  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap 
furthermore  while distributable cash flow is a measure we use to assess our ability to make distributions to our unitholders  it should not be viewed as indicative of the actual amount of cash that we have available for distributions or that we plan to distribute for a given period 
reconciliation to gaap measures 
adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow are not defined in gaap 
the gaap measures most directly comparable to adjusted ebitda are net income attributable to western gas partners  lp and net cash provided by operating activities  and the gaap measure most directly comparable to distributable cash flow is net income attributable to western gas partners  lp 
our non gaap financial measures of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow should not be considered as alternatives to the gaap measures of net income attributable to western gas partners  lp or net cash provided by operating activities 
adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow have important limitations as analytical tools because they exclude some  but not all  items that affect net income and net cash provided by operating activities 
you should not consider adjusted ebitda or distributable cash flow in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
our definitions of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies in our industry  thereby diminishing their utility 
management compensates for the limitations of adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow as analytical tools by reviewing the comparable gaap measures  understanding the differences between adjusted ebitda and distributable cash flow compared to as applicable net income and net cash provided by operating activities  and incorporating this knowledge into its decision making processes 
we believe that investors benefit from having access to the same financial measures that our management uses in evaluating our operating results 

table of contents the following tables present a reconciliation of a the non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda to the gaap financial measures of net income attributable to western gas partners  lp and net cash provided by operating activities  and b a reconciliation of the non gaap financial measure of distributable cash flow to the gaap financial measure of net income attributable to western gas partners  lp year ended december  in thousands reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income attributable to western gas partners  lp adjusted ebitda attributable to western gas partners  lp less distributions from equity investees non cash equity based compensation expense expenses in excess of omnibus cap interest expense income tax expense depreciation  amortization and impairments other expense  net add equity income  net interest income affiliate other income  net net income attributable to western gas partners  lp reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net cash provided by operating activities adjusted ebitda attributable to western gas partners  lp adjusted ebitda attributable to noncontrolling interests interest income expense  net non cash equity based compensation expense current income tax expense other income expense  net distributions from equity investees less than in excess of equity income  net expenses in excess of omnibus cap changes in operating working capital accounts receivable and natural gas imbalance receivable accounts payable  accrued liabilities and natural gas imbalance payable other net cash provided by operating activities includes the partnership s share of income tax expense  depreciation  amortization and impairments  other expense  net  and other income  net  attributable to chipeta

items affecting the comparability of our financial results our historical results of operations and cash flows for the periods presented may not be comparable to future or historic results of operations or cash flows for the reasons described below platte valley acquisition agreement 
in january  we entered into an agreement to acquire the platte valley gathering system and processing plant from a third party for million in cash  subject to closing adjustments 
these assets are located in the denver julesburg basin and consist of i a processing plant with two cryogenic processing trains with a combined capacity of mmcf d and two fractionation trains with a combined capacity of  barrels per day  ii a  mile gathering system that delivers gas to the platte valley plant  either directly or through our wattenberg gathering system  and iii related equipment 
the platte valley gathering system and processing plant are referred to collectively as the platte valley assets and the acquisition as the platte valley acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition  we will enter into long term fee based agreements with the seller to gather and process its existing natural gas production  as well as to expand the existing gathering systems and processing capacity to mmcf d 
we intend to finance the platte valley acquisition with available capacity under our revolving credit facility 
the acquisition is expected to close in the first quarter of  subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions 
affiliate contracts 
effective october   contracts covering substantially all of the granger assets affiliate throughput were converted from primarily keep whole contracts into a ten year fee based arrangement and  effective july   contracts covering all of wattenberg s affiliate throughput were converted from primarily keep whole contracts into a ten year fee based agreement 
these contract changes will impact the comparability of the statements of income and cash flows 
see note transactions with affiliates gas processing agreements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report 

table of contents commodity price swap agreements 
our financial results for historical periods reflect commodity price changes  which  in turn  impact the financial results derived from our percent of proceeds and keep whole processing contracts 
effective january   substantially all commodity price risk associated with our percent of proceeds and keep whole processing contracts at the hilight and newcastle systems has been mitigated through our fixed price commodity price swap agreements with anadarko that extend through december   with a partnership option to extend through beginning january   commodity price swap agreements were put in place to fix the margin we realize under both keep whole and percentage of proceeds contracts applicable to natural gas processing activities at the granger assets 
the commodity price swap arrangements for the granger assets expire in december beginning july   commodity price swap agreements were put in place to fix the margin we realize from the purchase and sale of natural gas  condensate or ngls at the wattenberg assets 
the commodity price swap arrangements for the wattenberg assets expire in june beginning october   commodity price swap agreements were put in place to mitigate exposure to commodity price volatility associated with condensate and natural gas sales and purchases at the hugoton system 
the commodity price swap arrangements associated with the hugoton system expire in september see note transactions with affiliates included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
federal income taxes 
we are generally not subject to federal income tax or state income tax other than texas margin tax on the portion of our income that is allocable to texas 
federal and state income tax expense was recorded prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets  except for the chipeta assets 
in addition  deferred federal and state income taxes are recorded on temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases with respect to the partnership assets prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets  and deferred state income taxes are recorded with respect to the partnership assets for periods including and subsequent to our acquisition 
the recognition of deferred federal and state tax assets prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets was based on management s belief that it was more likely than not that the results of future operations would generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
for periods including and subsequent to our acquisition of the partnership assets  except for the chipeta assets  we are only subject to texas margin tax  therefore  we no longer recognize deferred federal income tax assets and liabilities with respect to the partnership assets for periods including and subsequent to our acquisition of the partnership assets 
income tax expense attributable to texas margin tax will continue to be recognized in our consolidated financial statements 
substantially all of the income attributable to the chipeta assets prior to the june formation of chipeta  at which time substantially all of the chipeta assets were contributed to a non taxable entity for us federal income tax purposes  was subject to federal and state income taxes  while substantially all of the income earned by the chipeta assets subsequent to june was subject only to texas margin tax 
income attributable to the granger assets prior to and including january was subject to federal income tax  and income attributable to the wattenberg assets prior to and including july was subject to federal and state income tax 
income earned by the granger assets and wattenberg assets for periods subsequent to january and july  respectively  was subject only to texas margin tax 
for periods including and subsequent to our acquisition of the partnership assets  we are required to make payments to anadarko pursuant to a tax sharing agreement for our estimated share of non us federal taxes included in any combined or consolidated returns of anadarko 
general and administrative expenses under the omnibus agreement 
pursuant to the omnibus agreement  anadarko and the general partner perform centralized corporate functions for the partnership  such as legal  accounting  treasury  cash management  investor relations  insurance administration and claims processing  risk management  health  safety and environmental  information technology  human resources  credit  payroll  internal audit  tax  marketing and midstream administration 
prior to our ownership of the partnership assets  our historical consolidated financial statements reflect a management services fee representing the general and administrative expenses attributable to the partnership assets 
during the years ended december   and  anadarko billed us million  million and million  respectively  in allocated general and administrative expenses subject to the cap contained in the omnibus agreement 
in addition  our general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and  included million and million  respectively  of expenses incurred by anadarko and the general partner in excess of the cap contained in the omnibus agreement 
such expenses were recorded as capital contributions from anadarko and did not impact the partnership s cash flows 
the amounts charged under the omnibus agreement are greater than amounts allocated to us by anadarko for the aggregate management services fees reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements for periods prior to our ownership of the partnership assets 
we also incurred million  million and million in public company expenses  excluding equity based compensation  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we did not incur public company expenses prior to our initial public offering in may 
table of contents term loan agreements and revolving credit agreement 
from december to december  we borrowed amounts under various term loans and our revolving credit facility primarily to finance various acquisitions 
we have partially repaid amounts with proceeds from equity offerings as well as operating cash flows 
as of december   our debt consists of i million outstanding under our wattenberg term loan  which bears interest at a variable rate based on london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus a margin ranging from to  ii million outstanding under our term loan agreement with anadarko  under which we pay interest at a fixed rate of  reflecting an amendment to the term loan agreement made in december  and iii million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  under which we pay interest at libor plus applicable margins ranging from to 
see note debt and interest expense included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
distributions 
our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash as defined in the partnership agreement to unitholders of record on the applicable record date 
we have made cash distributions to our unitholders since the third quarter of and have increased our quarterly distribution each quarter from the third quarter of through the fourth quarter of we did not pay cash distributions to our unitholders for quarterly periods prior to june  see note partnership distributions included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
cash management 
we expect to rely upon external financing sources  including commercial bank borrowings and long term debt and equity issuances  to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures 
prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets  except for chipeta  we largely relied on internally generated cash flows and capital contributions from anadarko to satisfy our capital expenditure requirements 
in addition  all affiliate transactions related to such assets were net settled within our consolidated financial statements and were funded by anadarko s working capital 
effective on the date of our acquisition of the partnership assets  except for chipeta  all affiliate and third party transactions related to such assets are funded by our working capital 
prior to june  the date on which anadarko initially contributed assets to chipeta with respect to chipeta  sales and purchases related to third party transactions were received or paid in cash by anadarko within the centralized cash management system and were settled with chipeta through an adjustment to parent net investment 
subsequent to june   chipeta cash settled transactions directly with third parties and with anadarko affiliates 
these factors impact the comparability of our cash flow statements  working capital analysis and liquidity 
interest expense on intercompany balances 
for periods prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets  except for chipeta  we incurred interest expense or earned interest income on current intercompany balances with anadarko related to such assets 
these intercompany balances were extinguished through non cash transactions in connection with the closing of our initial public offering  the powder river acquisition  anadarko s initial contribution of assets to chipeta  the granger acquisition  wattenberg acquisition and awc acquisition 
therefore  interest expense and interest income attributable to these balances is reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements for the periods ending prior to our acquisition of the partnership assets  except for chipeta  and for periods ending prior to june  with respect to chipeta 
note receivable from anadarko 
concurrent with the closing of our initial public offering  we loaned million to anadarko in exchange for a year note bearing interest at a fixed annual rate of 
for periods including and subsequent to may   interest income attributable to the note is reflected in our consolidated financial statements so long as the note remains outstanding 
equity based compensation plans 
in connection with the closing of our initial public offering  our general partner adopted two compensation plans the ltip and the incentive plan 
phantom unit grants have been made under the ltip and incentive unit grants have been made under the incentive plan 
these grants result in equity based compensation expense which is determined  in part  by reference to the fair value of equity compensation as of the date of grant 
for periods ending prior to may   equity based compensation expense attributable to the ltip and incentive plan is not reflected in our historical consolidated financial statements as there were no outstanding equity grants under either plan 
for periods including and subsequent to may   the partnership s general and administrative expenses include equity based compensation costs allocated by anadarko and the general partner to the partnership for grants made under the ltip and incentive plan as well as under the anadarko petroleum corporation stock incentive plan and the anadarko petroleum corporation omnibus incentive compensation plan anadarko s plans are referred to collectively as the anadarko incentive plans 
see equity based compensation discussion included in note summary of significant accounting policies and note transactions with affiliates of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
the equity based compensation plans adopted in may impact the comparability of our financial statements for the year ended december  to subsequent periods 

table of contents general trends and outlook we expect our business to continue to be affected by the following key trends 
our expectations are based on our assumptions and information currently available to us 
to the extent our underlying assumptions about  or interpretations of  available information prove to be incorrect  our actual results may vary materially from our expectations 
impact of natural gas prices 
the relatively low natural gas price environment  which has persisted over the past two years  has led to lower levels of drilling activity in dry gas areas around certain of our assets 
several of our customers  including anadarko  have reduced activity levels in dry gas areas  shifting capital toward liquid rich opportunities that offer higher margins and superior economics to producers 
this trend has resulted in fewer new well connections in our dry gas areas of operations and  in some cases  temporary curtailments of production in those areas 
to the extent opportunities are available  we will continue to connect new wells to our systems to mitigate the impact of natural production declines in order to maintain throughput on our systems 
however  our success in connecting new wells to our systems is dependent on the activities of natural gas producers and shippers 
changes in regulations 
our operations and the operations of our customers have been  and at times in the future may be  affected by political developments and are subject to an increasing number of complex federal  state  tribal  local and other laws and regulations such as production restrictions  permitting delays  limitations on hydraulic fracturing and environmental protection regulations 
we and or our customers must obtain and maintain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state  tribal and local governmental authorities 
for example  regulation of hydraulic fracturing is currently primarily conducted at the state level through permitting and other compliance requirements 
if proposed federal legislation is adopted  it could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting 
any changes in statutory regulations or delays in the issuance of required permits may impact both the throughput on and profitability of our systems 
access to capital markets 
we require periodic access to capital in order to fund acquisitions and expansion projects 
under the terms of our partnership agreement  we are required to distribute all of our available cash to our unitholders  which makes us dependent upon raising capital to fund growth projects 
historically  master limited partnerships have accessed the debt and equity capital markets to raise money for new growth projects and acquisitions 
recent market turbulence has from time to time either raised the cost of those public funds or  in some cases  eliminated the availability of these funds to prospective issuers 
if we are unable either to access the public capital markets or find alternative sources of capital  our growth strategy may be more challenging to execute 
impact of inflation 
although inflation in the us has been relatively low in recent years  the us economy could experience a significant inflationary effect from  among other things  the governmental stimulus plans enacted since to the extent permitted by regulations and escalation provisions in our existing agreements  we have the ability to recover a portion of increased costs in the form of higher fees 
impact of interest rates 
interest rates were at or near historic lows at certain times during should interest rates rise  our financing costs would increase accordingly 
additionally  as with other yield oriented securities  our unit price is impacted by the level of our cash distributions and an associated implied distribution yield 
therefore  changes in interest rates  either positive or negative  may affect the yield requirements of investors who invest in our units  and a rising interest rate environment could have an adverse impact on our unit price and our ability to issue additional equity  or increase the cost of issuing equity  to make acquisitions  reduce debt or for other purposes 
however  we expect our cost of capital to remain competitive  as our competitors would face similar circumstances 
acquisition opportunities 
as of december   anadarko s total domestic midstream asset portfolio  excluding the assets we own  consisted of eighteen gathering systems and nine processing and or treating facilities  with an aggregate throughput of approximately bcf d 
a key component of our growth strategy is to acquire midstream assets from anadarko and third parties over time 
as of december   anadarko owns a general partner interest in us  all of our idrs and a limited partner interest in us 
given anadarko s significant interests in us  we believe anadarko will benefit from selling additional assets to us over time  however  anadarko continually evaluates acquisitions and divestitures and may elect to acquire  construct or dispose of midstream assets in the future without offering us the opportunity to acquire or construct those assets 
should anadarko choose to pursue additional midstream asset sales  it is under no contractual obligation to offer assets or business opportunities to us 
we may also pursue certain asset acquisitions from third parties to the extent such acquisitions complement our or anadarko s existing asset base or allow us to capture operational efficiencies from anadarko s or third party production 
however  if we do not make additional acquisitions from anadarko or third parties on economically acceptable terms  our future growth will be limited  and the acquisitions we make could reduce  rather than increase  our cash flows generated from operations on a per unit basis

gathering and transportation throughput decreased by mmcf d for the year ended december   primarily due to throughput decreases at the pinnacle  haley  dew and hugoton systems resulting from natural production declines and reduced drilling activity in those areas as a result of low natural gas prices 
these declines were partially offset by throughput increases at the wattenberg system due to increased drilling activity and recompletions driven by favorable producer economics in the area

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary cash requirements are for acquisitions and other capital expenditures  debt service  customary operating expenses  quarterly distributions to our limited partners and general partner and distributions to our noncontrolling interest owners 
our sources of liquidity as of december  include cash flows generated from operations  including interest income on our million note receivable from anadarko  available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility  and issuances of additional common and general partner units 
we believe that cash flows generated from the sources above will be sufficient to satisfy our short term working capital requirements and long term maintenance capital expenditure requirements 
the amount of future distributions to unitholders will depend on results of operations  financial conditions  capital requirements and other factors  and will be determined by the board of directors of our general partner on a quarterly basis 
due to our cash distribution policy  we expect to rely on external financing sources  including debt and common unit issuances  to fund expansion capital expenditures and future acquisitions 
however  to limit interest expense  we may use operating cash flows to fund expansion capital expenditures or acquisitions  which could result in subsequent borrowing under our revolving credit facility to pay distributions or fund other short term working capital requirements 
our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash as defined in the partnership agreement to unitholders of record on the applicable record date 
we have made cash distributions to our unitholders and have increased our quarterly distribution each quarter from the second quarter of through the fourth quarter of on january   the board of directors of our general partner declared a cash distribution to our unitholders of per unit  or million in aggregate  including incentive distributions 
the cash distribution was paid on february  to unitholders of record at the close of business on february  management continuously monitors the partnership s leverage position and coordinates its capital expenditure program  quarterly distributions and acquisition strategy with its expected cash flows and projected debt repayment schedule 
we will continue to evaluate funding alternatives  including additional borrowings and the issuance of debt or equity securities  to secure funds as needed or refinance outstanding debt balances with longer term notes 
to facilitate a potential debt or equity securities issuance  we have the ability to sell securities under our shelf registration statement  which became effective with the sec in august our ability to generate cash flows is subject to a number of factors  some of which are beyond our control 
please read item a risk factors of this annual report 
working capital 
as of december  we had million of working capital  which we define as the amount by which current assets exceed current liabilities 
working capital is an indication of our liquidity and potential need for short term funding 
our working capital requirements are driven by changes in accounts receivable and accounts payable and factors such as credit extended to  and the timing of collections from  our customers and the level and timing of our spending for maintenance and expansion activity 
capital expenditures 
our business can be capital intensive  requiring significant investment to maintain and improve existing facilities 
we categorize capital expenditures as either of the following maintenance capital expenditures  which include those expenditures required to maintain the existing operating capacity and service capability of our assets  such as to replace system components and equipment that have suffered significant use over time  become obsolete or approached the end of their useful lives  to remain in compliance with regulatory or legal requirements or to complete additional well connections to maintain existing system throughput and related cash flows  or expansion capital expenditures  which include those expenditures incurred in order to extend the useful lives of our assets  reduce costs  increase revenues or increase system throughput or capacity from current levels  including well connections that increase existing system throughput

table of contents we expect our exposure to concentrated risk of non payment or non performance to continue for as long as we remain substantially dependent on anadarko for our revenues 
additionally  we are exposed to credit risk on the note receivable from anadarko  which was issued concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering 
we are also party to agreements with anadarko under which anadarko is required to indemnify us for certain environmental claims  losses arising from rights of way claims  failures to obtain required consents or governmental permits and income taxes with respect to the assets acquired from anadarko 
finally  we have entered into various commodity price swap agreements with anadarko in order to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk and are subject to performance risk thereunder

asset retirement obligations 
when assets are acquired or constructed  the initial estimated asset retirement obligation is recognized in an amount equal to the net present value of the settlement obligation  with an associated increase in properties and equipment 
revisions to estimated asset retirement obligations can result from revisions to estimated inflation rates and discount rates  changes in retirement costs and the estimated timing of settlement

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make informed judgments and estimates that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and affect the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the periods reported 
on an ongoing basis  management reviews its estimates  including those related to the determination of properties and equipment  goodwill  asset retirement obligations  litigation  environmental liabilities  income taxes and fair values 
although these estimates are based on management s best available knowledge of current and expected future events  changes in facts and circumstances or discovery of new information may result in revised estimates and actual results may differ from these estimates 
management considers the following to be its most critical accounting estimates that involve judgment and discusses the selection and development of these estimates with the audit committee of our general partner 
for additional information concerning our accounting policies  see the note summary of significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
depreciation 
depreciation expense is generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the assets 
determination of depreciation expense requires judgment regarding the estimated useful lives and salvage values of property  plant and equipment 
as circumstances warrant  depreciation estimates are reviewed to determine if any changes in the underlying assumptions are necessary 
the weighted average life of our long lived assets is approximately years 
if the depreciable lives of our assets were reduced by  we estimate that annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately million  which would result in a corresponding reduction in our operating income 
impairments of tangible assets 
property  plant and equipment are generally stated at the lower of historical cost less accumulated depreciation or fair value  if impaired 
because acquisitions of assets from anadarko are transfers of net assets between entities under common control  the partnership assets acquired by us from anadarko are initially recorded at anadarko s historic carrying value 
assets acquired in a business combination or non monetary exchange with a third party are initially recorded at fair value 
property  plant and equipment balances are evaluated for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable from expected undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of an asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is not expected to be recoverable from future undiscounted cash flows  an impairment may be recognized 
any impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its estimated fair value 
in assessing long lived assets for impairments  management evaluates changes in our business and economic conditions and their implications for recoverability of the assets carrying amounts 
since a significant portion of our revenues arises from gathering  processing and transporting the natural gas production from anadarko operated properties  significant downward revisions in reserve estimates or changes in future development plans by anadarko  to the extent they affect our operations  may necessitate assessment of the carrying amount of our affected assets for recoverability 
such assessment requires application of judgment regarding the use and ultimate disposition of the asset  long range revenue and expense estimates  global and regional economic conditions  including commodity prices and drilling activity by our customers  as well as other factors affecting estimated future net cash flows 
the measure of impairments to be recognized  if any  depends upon management s estimate of the asset s fair value  which may be determined based on the estimates of future net cash flows or values at which similar assets were transferred in the market in recent transactions  if such data is available 
impairments of goodwill 
goodwill represents the allocated portion of anadarko s midstream goodwill attributed to the assets the partnership has acquired from anadarko 
the carrying value of anadarko s midstream goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of an entity over the estimated fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed by anadarko 
accordingly  our goodwill balance does not reflect  and in some cases is significantly higher than  the difference between the consideration paid by us for acquisitions from anadarko compared to the fair value of the net assets acquired 
we evaluate whether goodwill has been impaired annually as of october  unless facts and circumstances make it necessary to test more frequently 
management has determined that we have one operating segment and two reporting units i gathering and processing and transportation 
the carrying value of goodwill as of december  was million for the gathering and processing reporting unit and million for the transportation reporting unit 
accounting standards require that goodwill be assessed for impairment at the reporting unit level 
goodwill impairment assessment is a two step process 
step one focuses on identifying a potential impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  no further action is required 
however  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is written down to the implied fair value of the goodwill through a charge to operating expense based on a hypothetical purchase price allocation 

table of contents because quoted market prices for our reporting units are not available  management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of reporting units for purposes of performing the goodwill impairment test 
management uses information available to make these fair value estimates  including market multiples of adjusted ebitda 
specifically  management estimates fair value by applying an estimated multiple to projected adjusted ebitda 
management considered observable transactions in the market  as well as trading multiples for peers  to determine an appropriate multiple to apply against our projected adjusted ebitda 
a lower fair value estimate in the future for any of our reporting units could result in a goodwill impairment 
factors that could trigger a lower fair value estimate include sustained price declines  throughput declines  cost increases  regulatory or political environment changes  and other changes in market conditions such as decreased prices in market based transactions for similar assets 
based on our most recent goodwill impairment test  we concluded that the fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded the carrying value of the reporting unit 
therefore  no goodwill impairment was indicated and no goodwill impairment has been recognized in these consolidated financial statements 
fair value 
management estimates fair value in performing impairment tests for long lived assets and goodwill as well as for the initial measurement of asset retirement obligations and the initial recognition of environmental obligations assumed in third party acquisitions 
when management is required to measure fair value  and there is not a market observable price for the asset or liability  or a market observable price for a similar asset or liability  management generally utilizes an income or multiples valuation approach 
the income approach utilizes management s best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows  and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk adjusted discount rate 
such evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment  since the results are based on expected future events or conditions  such as sales prices  estimates of future throughput  capital and operating costs and the timing thereof  economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
a multiple approach utilizes management s best assumptions regarding expectations of projected ebitda and multiple of that ebitda that a buyer would pay to acquire an asset 
management s estimates of future net cash flows and ebitda are inherently imprecise because they reflect management s expectation of future conditions that are often outside of management s control 
however  assumptions used reflect a market participant s view of long term prices  costs and other factors  and are consistent with assumptions used in our business plans and investment decisions 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases 
the information pertaining to operating leases required for this item is provided in note commitments and contingencies included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report  which information is incorporated by reference

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk 
pursuant to certain of our contracts  we retain and sell drip condensate that is recovered during the gathering of natural gas 
as part of this arrangement  we are required to provide a thermally equivalent volume of natural gas or the cash equivalent thereof to the shipper 
thus  our revenues for this portion of our contractual arrangement are based on the price received for the drip condensate and our costs for this portion of our contractual arrangement depend on the price of natural gas 
historically  drip condensate sells at a price representing a discount to the price of new york mercantile exchange  or nymex  west texas intermediate crude oil 
in addition  certain of our processing services are provided under percent of proceeds and keep whole agreements in which anadarko is typically responsible for the marketing of the natural gas and ngls 
under percent of proceeds agreements  we receive a specified percentage of the net proceeds from the sale of natural gas and ngls 
under keep whole agreements  we keep of the ngls produced  and the processed natural gas  or value of the gas  is returned to the producer 
since some of the gas is used and removed during processing  we compensate the producer for this amount of gas by supplying additional gas or by paying an agreed upon value for the gas utilized 
to mitigate our exposure to changes in commodity prices as a result of the purchase and sale of natural gas  condensate or ngls  we entered into fixed price commodity price swap agreements with anadarko for the powder river assets  which extend through december   with a partnership option to extend through  for the granger assets  which extend through the end of  for the wattenberg assets  which extend through june   and for the hugoton system  which extend through september  for additional information on the commodity price swap agreements  see note transactions with affiliates included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included under item of this annual report 
we consider our exposure to commodity price risk associated with the above described arrangements to be minimal given the existence of the commodity price swap agreements with anadarko and the relatively small amount of our operating income that is impacted by changes in market prices 
accordingly  we do not expect a change in natural gas or ngl prices to have a material direct impact on our operating income  financial condition or cash flows for the next twelve months  excluding the effect of natural gas imbalances described below 
we also bear a limited degree of commodity price risk with respect to settlement of our natural gas imbalances that arise from differences in gas volumes received into our systems and gas volumes delivered by us to customers 
natural gas volumes owed to or by us that are subject to monthly cash settlement are valued according to the terms of the contract as of the balance sheet dates  and generally reflect market index prices 
other natural gas volumes owed to or by us are valued at our weighted average cost of natural gas as of the balance sheet dates and are settled in kind 
our exposure to the impact of changes in commodity prices on outstanding imbalances depends on the timing of settlement of the imbalances 
interest rate risk 
interest rates during and were low compared to historic rates 
if interest rates rise  our future financing costs will increase 
as of december   we owed million under the wattenberg term loan and million under our revolving credit facility  both at variable interest rates based on libor  and we owed million under the note payable to anadarko that bears a fixed rate 
see note debt and interest expense included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
for the year ended december   a change in libor would have resulted in a nominal change in net income 
we may incur additional debt in the future  either under the revolving credit facility or other financing sources  including commercial bank borrowings or debt issuances
