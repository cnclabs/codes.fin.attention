edison international earnings are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles used in the united states 
management uses core earnings by principal operating subsidiary internally for financial planning and for analysis of performance 
core earnings by principal operating subsidiary are also used when communicating with analysts and investors regarding our earnings results to facilitate comparisons of the company performance from period to period 
core earnings are a non gaap financial measure and may not be comparable to those of other companies 
core earnings are defined as earnings attributable to edison international shareholders less income or loss from discontinued operations and income or loss from significant discrete items that management does not consider representative of ongoing earnings  such as exit activities  including lease terminations  sale of certain assets  early debt extinguishment costs and other activities that are no longer continuing  asset impairments and certain tax  regulatory or legal settlements or proceedings 
sce core earnings increased million primarily due to higher operating income and capitalized financing costs afudc  both driven by higher rate base growth  and lower income tax expense 
the lower tax expense in includes a change in the method of tax accounting for asset removal costs primarily related to sce infrastructure replacement program 
emg core earnings decreased million from primarily from higher plant maintenance costs in due to scheduled outages in emg merchant power plants  unrealized losses in compared to gains in  higher income tax expense partially offset by higher energy trading revenues 

table of contents edison international parent and other core losses increased from primarily due to higher interest and general and administrative costs 
consolidated non core items for edison international included an after tax earnings benefit of million recorded in relating to the california impact of the federal global settlement resulting from acceptance by the california franchise tax board of tax positions finalized with the irs in and a revision to interest recorded on the federal global settlement 
in  edison international recorded an after tax earnings charge of million related to the global settlement with the irs and termination of emg cross border leases million pre tax loss 
for further discussion of the global settlement  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note income taxes 
an after tax earnings charge of million recorded in to reverse previously recognized federal tax benefits eliminated by the recently enacted federal health care legislation 
the new health care law eliminated the federal tax deduction for retiree health care costs to the extent those costs are eligible for federal medicare part d subsidies 
an after tax earnings charge of million million pre tax recorded in the fourth quarter of resulting from the write off of capitalized engineering and other costs for air emissions control technology that is not currently being pursued for use at the powerton station 
these activities were previously suspended as midwest generation pursued testing and evaluation of the use of a dry sorbent injection system using trona or similar sorbents which is expected to require lower capital costs 
the illinois epa recently issued a construction permit to authorize installation of a dry sorbent injection system  which midwest generation currently expects to use if this project is undertaken

capital expenditures under the program were primarily for upgrading  maintaining and expanding sce transmission and distribution system  extending the useful life of generation assets  and installing smart meters 
total capital expenditures were billion in and billion in a description of sce capital program for and status of major rate cases is discussed below 
capital program sce capital program for is focused primarily in the following areas maintaining reliability and expanding the capability of sce transmission and distribution system 
upgrading and constructing new transmission lines for system reliability and increased access to renewable energy  including the tehachapi  devers colorado river  eldorado ivanpah  red bluff and alberhill projects

sce plans to utilize cash generated from its operations  tax benefits and issuance of additional debt and preferred equity to fund its capital needs 
sce rate cases cpuc general rate case on november   sce filed its grc application requesting a base rate revenue requirement of billion 
after considering the effects of sales growth  sce request would be an million increase in base rate revenue 
the requested revenue requirement increase is driven by investments in capital projects to maintain system reliability and accommodate customer load growth  as well as an increase in operation and maintenance expenses primarily for capital related projects  information technology  insurance premiums and pension contributions 
if the cpuc approves the requested rate increase  the system average rate increase over base rate and total revenue requirement is estimated to be and  respectively 
the increase excludes the impact of rate changes not associated with the cpuc grc  such as rates to recover purchased power 
the application also proposes a ratemaking mechanism that would result in and incremental base rate revenue requirement increases  net of sales growth of million and million  respectively  driven by the same reasons 
sce is required to update its grc request to reflect  among other items  the impacts of governmental and legislative actions 
as part of this update  sce expects the base rate revenue requirement will be reduced to reflect bonus depreciation discussed below in bonus depreciation impact on edison international 
bonus depreciation is an acceleration of future tax deductions which results in a reduction to rate base 
sce intends to update its grc request after the irs issues final regulations 
the current schedule anticipates a final decision on sce grc by the end of sce cannot predict the revenue requirement the cpuc will ultimately authorize or when a final decision will be adopted 
ferc rate case in february  the ferc approved a settlement agreement in sce ferc rate case that provides a ferc retail base revenue requirement of million  an increase of million  or  over the ferc base revenue requirement 
the increased revenue requirement is primarily due to an increase in transmission capital investments and will be retroactive to march  as of december   sce had collected revenue  subject to refund  of million that will be refunded to ratepayers 
sce did not previously recognize revenue for the amount that will be refunded 
nrc oversight of san onofre sce continues to apply increased management focus and other resources to san onofre to address regulatory and performance issues identified by the nrc see item business southern california edison company regulation nuclear power plant regulation for further discussion 
management overview of emg emg competitive power generation business primarily consists of the generation and sale into the pjm market of energy and capacity from its approximately  megawatts of coal fired power plants 
the profitability of these operations is expected to decline significantly in as a result of lower realized energy prices largely driven by the expiration of hedge contracts and higher fuel costs 
in addition  the profitability of emg midwest generation plants is expected to be adversely affected in by a decline in capacity prices projected to begin in june and higher rail transportation costs due to the expiration at the end of of a favorable long term rail contract

at december   emg and its subsidiaries had billion in cash and cash equivalents and million of liquidity available from credit facilities that expire in emg principal subsidiary  eme  had billion of notes outstanding at december   million of which mature in emg business plans are focused on operating effectively through the current commodity price cycle and on environmental compliance and renewable energy plans as described below 
environmental developments midwest generation environmental compliance plans and costs during  midwest generation continued its permitting and planning activities for nox and nox controls to meet the requirements of the cps 
midwest generation has received all necessary permits from the illinois epa to allow the installation of sncr technology on multiple units to meet the nox portion of the cps 
in november and february  the illinois epa issued construction permits authorizing midwest generation to install a dry sorbent injection system using trona or its equivalent at the waukegan generating station unit and units and at the powerton station 
the permit for unit for the waukegan station also authorizes midwest generation to convert the existing electrostatic precipitator to a cold side design which will improve removal efficiency of particulate matter to satisfy the particulate control requirements of the cps 
testing of dry scrubbing using trona on select midwest generation units has demonstrated significant reductions in so emissions 
use of this technology in conjunction with low sulfur coal is expected to require substantially less capital and time than the use of spray dryer absorber technology  but would likely result in higher ongoing operating costs and may consequently result in lower dispatch rates and competitiveness of midwest generation plants  depending on competitors costs 
based on work to date  midwest generation estimates the cost of retrofitting all units  using dry scrubbing with sodium based sorbents to comply with cps requirements for so emissions  and the associated upgrading of existing particulate removal systems  would be approximately billion in dollars 
if these projects are undertaken  these expenditures would be incurred through decisions regarding whether or not to proceed with the above projects or other approaches to compliance remain subject to a number of factors  such as market conditions  regulatory and legislative developments  and forecasted commodity prices and capital and operating costs applicable at the time decisions are required or made 
midwest generation could also elect to shut down units  instead of installing controls  to be in compliance with the cps 
therefore  decisions about any particular combination of retrofits and shutdowns it may ultimately employ also remain subject to conditions applicable at the time decisions are required or made 
due to existing uncertainties about these factors  midwest generation intends to defer final decisions about particular units for the maximum time available 
accordingly  final decisions on whether to install controls  to install particular kinds of controls  and to actually expend capital that is budgeted may not occur until for some of the units and potentially later for others 
preconstruction engineering and initial construction work on a project may occur in in advance of a final decision to continue or complete the project 
homer city environmental issues and capital resource limitations homer city may be required to install additional environmental equipment on units and to comply with environmental regulations under the transport rule 
homer city projects that if so reduction technology becomes required  it may need to make capital commitments for such equipment several years in advance of the effective date of such requirements 
homer city continues to review technologies available to reduce so and mercury emissions and to monitor developments related to hazardous pollutants and other environmental regulations 
the timing  selection of technology and required capital costs remain uncertain 
the installation of environmental compliance equipment will be dependent on lessor decisions regarding the funding of these expenditures 
restrictions under the agreements entered into as part of homer city sale leaseback transaction could affect  and in some cases significantly limit or prohibit  homer city ability to incur indebtedness or make capital expenditures 
eme has no legal 
table of contents obligation to provide funding

the change in tax accounting method resulted in a million cash benefit realized in the fourth quarter of this initial benefit was based on an estimated cumulative catch up deduction for certain repair costs that were previously capitalized and depreciated over the tax depreciable life of the property 
the deduction reflected on the income tax return was consistent with this cash benefit 
the amount claimed on the tax return may be revised in the future based on further guidance from the irs 
the income tax benefit from the change in accounting for repair costs represents a timing difference which will reverse over the estimated remaining tax life of the assets 
this method change  and incremental deductions taken in and  did not impact sce or results of operations 
regulatory treatment for future increases in income taxes related to this matter will be addressed in sce grc 
sce has not recognized an earnings benefit or regulatory asset  as the regulatory treatment is pending 
margin and collateral deposits derivative instruments and power procurement contracts certain derivative instruments and power procurement contracts under sce power and natural gas hedging activities contain collateral requirements 
sce has historically provided collateral in the form of cash and or letters of credit for the benefit of counterparties 
collateral requirements can vary depending upon the level of unsecured credit extended by counterparties  changes in market prices relative to contractual commitments  and other factors 
future collateral requirements may be higher or lower than requirements at december   due to the addition of incremental power and energy procurement contracts with collateral requirements  if any  and the impact of changes in wholesale power and natural gas prices on sce contractual obligations 
certain of these power procurement contracts contain a provision that requires sce to maintain an investment grade credit rating from the major credit rating agencies 
if sce credit rating were to fall below investment grade  sce may be required to pay the liability or post additional collateral 
the table 
table of contents below illustrates the amount of collateral posted by sce to its counterparties as well as the potential collateral that would be required as of december  in millions collateral posted as of december  incremental collateral requirements for power procurement contracts resulting from a potential downgrade of sce credit rating to below investment grade posted and potential collateral requirements for derivative instruments and power procurement contracts collateral posted consisted of million which was offset against net derivative liabilities and million provided to counterparties and other brokers consisting of million in cash reflected in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets and million in letters of credit 
total posted and potential collateral requirements may increase by an additional million  based on sce forward positions as of december   due to adverse market price movements over the remaining life of the existing power procurement contracts using a confidence level 
potential regulation of swaps under the dodd frank act the dodd frank act may impact margin  capital and collateral requirements in the future

workers compensation self insurance fund sce is self insured for workers compensation claims 
sce assesses workers compensation claims that have been asserted and those that have been incurred but not reported to determine the probable amount of losses that should be recorded 
the department of industrial relations for the state of california requires companies that are self insured for workers compensation to post collateral in the form of cash and or letters of credits based on the estimated workers compensation liability if a company bond rating were to fall below b 
as of december   if sce bond rating were to fall below a b rating  sce would be required to post million for its workers compensation self insurance plan 
regulatory balancing accounts sce cash flows are affected by regulatory balancing account over or under collections 
balancing account over and under collections represent differences between cash collected in current rates and the costs incurred related to these regulatory mechanisms 
in general  sce seeks to adjust rates on an annual basis to recover or refund the balances recorded in certain balancing accounts 
however  some over collections relate to specific programs that the cpuc has established annual funding levels in which funds must be spent by a certain date and therefore these over collections are not necessarily included in annual rate changes 
balancing account under collections and over collections accrue interest based on a three month commercial paper rate published by the federal reserve 
as of december   balancing account net over collections were billion primarily related to base rate differences  fuel and power procurement related costs erra and various public purpose related program costs 
sce expects to refund the base rate and erra combined over collection of million through a rate adjustment beginning on june  the remaining over collections are expected to decrease as costs are incurred  amounts are refunded to ratepayers  or used to fund future programs established by the cpuc 
balancing account over or under collections may fluctuate due to  among other things  changes in sales volume driven by growth or declines in customer base and weather  procurement related costs driven both by market prices and sales volumes  and timing of expenditures under certain public purpose programs

environmental remediation sce records its environmental remediation liabilities when site assessments and or remedial actions are probable and a range of reasonably likely cleanup costs can be estimated 
sce reviews its sites and measures the liability quarterly  by assessing a range of reasonably likely costs for each identified site using currently available information  including existing technology  presently enacted laws and regulations  experience gained at similar sites  and the probable level of involvement and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties 
these estimates include costs for site investigations  remediation  operations and maintenance  monitoring and site closure 
unless there is a probable amount  sce records the lower end of this reasonably likely range of costs classified as other long term liabilities at undiscounted amounts as timing of cash flows is uncertain 
as of december   sce identified sites for remediation and recorded an estimated minimum liability of million 
sce expects to recover of its remediation costs at certain sites 
see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note commitments and contingencies for further discussion 
market risk exposures sce primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates  commodity prices and volumes  and counterparty credit 
fluctuations in interest rates can affect earnings and cash flows 
fluctuations in commodity prices and volumes and counterparty credit losses may temporarily affect cash flows  but are not expected to affect earnings due to expected recovery through regulatory mechanisms 
sce uses derivative instruments  as appropriate  to manage its market risks 
interest rate risk sce is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing and short term investing activities used for liquidity purposes  to fund business operations and to fund capital investments 
the nature and amount of sce long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
sce authorized return on common equity was for  and  respectively  and has been authorized to remain at through december absent any future potential annual adjustment 
sce authorized return on common equity is established in a multi year cost of capital mechanism  which allows for annual adjustments if certain thresholds are reached 
variances in actual financing costs compared to authorized financing costs impact earnings either positively or negatively 
at december   the fair market value of sce long term debt including current portion of long term debt was billion  compared to a carrying value of billion 
a increase in market interest rates would have resulted in a million decrease in the fair market value of sce long term debt 
a decrease in market interest rates would have resulted in a million increase in the fair market value of sce long term debt 
commodity price risk sce is exposed to commodity price risk which represents the potential impact that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular commodity 
sce hedging program reduces ratepayer exposure to variability in market prices related to sce power and gas activities 
sce expects recovery of its related hedging costs through the erra balancing account  and as a result  exposure to commodity price is not expected to impact earnings  but may impact the timing of cash flows 
sce hedging program reduces ratepayer exposure to variability in market prices 
as part of this program  sce enters into energy options  swaps  forward arrangements  tolling arrangements  and congestion revenue rights crrs 
the transactions are pre approved by the cpuc or executed in compliance with cpuc approved procurement plans

fair value of derivative instruments sce records its derivative instruments on its consolidated balance sheets at fair value unless they meet the definition of a normal purchase or sale exception 
derivative instrument fair values are marked to market at each reporting period 
any fair value changes are expected to be recovered from or refunded to customers through regulatory mechanisms and  therefore  sce fair value changes have no impact on purchased power expense or earnings 
sce does not use hedge accounting for these transactions due to this regulatory accounting treatment 
for further discussion on fair value measurements and the fair value hierarchy  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note fair value measurements 
the fair value of outstanding derivative instruments used at sce to mitigate its exposure to commodity price risk was a net liability of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following table summarizes the increase or decrease to the fair values of outstanding derivative instruments as of december   if the electricity prices or gas prices were changed while leaving all other assumptions constant in millions december  increase in electricity prices by decrease in electricity prices by increase in gas prices by decrease in gas prices by credit risk for information related to credit risks and how sce manages credit risk  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative instruments and hedging activities 
credit risk exposure from counterparties for power and gas trading activities is measured as the sum of net accounts receivable accounts receivable less accounts payable and the current fair value of net derivative assets derivative assets less derivative liabilities reflected on the consolidated balance sheets 
sce enters into master agreements which typically provide for a right of setoff 
accordingly  sce credit risk exposure from counterparties is based on a net exposure under these arrangements 
sce manages the credit risk on the portfolio for both rated and non rated counterparties based on credit ratings using published ratings of counterparties and other publicly disclosed information  such as financial statements  regulatory filings  and press releases  to guide it in the process of setting credit levels  risk limits and contractual arrangements  including master netting agreements 
as of december   the amount of balance sheet exposure as described above broken down by the credit ratings of sce counterparties  was as follows december  in millions exposure collateral net exposure s p credit rating a or higher a bbb bbb bbb below investment grade not rated total sce assigns a credit rating based on the lower of a counterparty s p or moody rating 
for ease of reference  the above table uses the s p classifications to summarize risk  but reflects the lower of the two credit ratings 
exposure excludes amounts related to contracts classified as normal purchases and sales and non derivative contractual commitments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets  except for any related net accounts receivable

midwest generation could elect to shut down units instead of installing controls to be in compliance with the cps  and  therefore  decisions about any particular combination of retrofits and shutdowns it may ultimately employ to comply remain subject to conditions applicable at the time decisions are required or made 
accordingly  the environmental expenditures for midwest generation in the preceding table represent current projects only and are subject to change based upon a number of considerations 
actual expenditures could be higher or lower 
preconstruction engineering and initial construction work may occur in in advance of a final decision to continue or complete the project

the capital investment plan set forth in the previous table does not include environmental capital expenditures for homer city 
however  depending on upcoming and future regulatory developments  homer city may be required to undertake capital projects to install additional pollution control equipment which will be dependent on lessor decisions regarding the funding of these expenditures

renewable energy projects capital and construction expenditures include a project of an unconsolidated entity in which construction expenditures will be substantially funded by emg 
construction project financing of million was available as of december  in addition  us treasury grants of million are anticipated based on estimated eligible construction costs for renewable projects completed in and scheduled to be completed in future projects at december   emg had a development pipeline of potential wind projects with projected installed capacity of approximately  mw 
the development pipeline represents potential projects with respect to which emg either owns the project rights or has exclusive acquisition rights 
future development of the wind portfolio is dependent on the availability of third party capital 
to the extent that third party capital is available  the success of development efforts will depend upon  among other things  obtaining permits and agreements necessary to support an investment 
this process may take a number of years due to factors that include local permit requirements  willingness of local utilities to purchase renewable power at sufficient prices to earn an appropriate rate of return  and availability and prices of equipment

the increase as compared to in cash used by financing activities from continuing operations was attributable to repayments of million and million under eme corporate credit facility and midwest generation working capital facility  respectively 
these repayments were partially offset by proceeds received from the issuance of a million term loan as part of a million project financing completed in june net cash used by investing activities cash used by investing activities from continuing operations decreased billion in  compared to the same period in the decrease was primarily due to billion of net proceeds from termination of the cross border leases at edison capital in the change was also due to the construction of wind projects 
credit ratings overview credit ratings for eme  midwest generation and emmt as of december  were as follows moody rating s p rating fitch rating eme b b b midwest generation ba b bb emmt not rated b not rated senior unsecured rating 
first priority senior secured rating 
all the above ratings are on negative outlook 
emg cannot provide assurance that its current credit ratings or the credit ratings of its subsidiaries will remain in effect for any given period of time or that one or more of these ratings will not be lowered 
emg notes that these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold its securities and may be revised at any time by a rating agency 
emg does not have any rating triggers contained in subsidiary financings that would result in it being required to make equity contributions or provide additional financial support to its subsidiaries  including emmt 
however  coal contracts at midwest generation include provisions that provide the right to request additional collateral to support payment obligations for delivered coal and may vary based on midwest generation credit ratings 
furthermore  emmt also has hedge contracts that do not require margin  but contain the right of each party to request additional credit support in the form of adequate assurance of performance in the case of an adverse development affecting the other party 
credit rating of emmt the homer city sale leaseback documents restrict homer city ability to enter into derivative activities with emmt to sell forward the output of the homer city plant if emmt does not have an investment grade credit rating from s p or moody or  in the absence of those ratings  if it is not rated as investment grade pursuant to emg internal credit scoring procedures 
these documents also include a requirement that homer city counterparty to such transactions  whether it is emmt or another party  and homer city  if acting as seller to an unaffiliated third party  be investment grade 
emg currently sells all the output from the homer city plant through emmt  which has a below investment grade credit rating  and homer city is not rated 
in order to continue to sell forward the output of the homer city plant through 
table of contents emmt  emg has obtained a consent from the sale leaseback owner participants that allows homer city to enter into such sales  under specified conditions  through march  homer city continues to be in compliance with the terms of the consent  however  because emmt credit rating has dropped below bb  the consent is revocable by the sale leaseback owner participants at any time 
the sale leaseback owner participants have not indicated that they intend to revoke the consent  however  there can be no assurance that they will not do so in the future 
an additional consequence of emmt lowered credit rating is a requirement for emmt to prepay for homer city output to satisfy a requirement under the terms of the consent that outstanding accounts receivable between emmt and homer city be reduced to zero 
revocation of the consent would not affect trades between emmt and homer city that had been entered into while the consent was still in effect 
emg is permitted to sell the output of the homer city plant into the spot market on the terms set forth in the homer city sale leaseback documents 
margin  collateral deposits and other credit support for energy contracts to reduce its exposure to market risk  emg hedges a portion of its electricity price exposure through emmt 
in connection with entering into contracts  emmt may be required to support its risk of nonperformance through parent guarantees  margining or other credit support 
emg has entered into guarantees in support of emmt hedging and trading activities  however  emg has historically also provided collateral in the form of cash and letters of credit for the benefit of counterparties related to the net of accounts payable  accounts receivable  unrealized losses  and unrealized gains in connection with these hedging and trading activities 
at december   emmt had deposited million in cash with clearing brokers in support of futures contracts and had deposited million in cash with counterparties in support of forward energy and congestion contracts 
cash collateral provided to others offset against derivative liabilities totaled million at december  in addition  emg had received cash collateral of million at december  to support credit risk of counterparties under margin agreements 
the liability for margin deposits received from counterparties has been offset against net derivative assets 
future cash collateral requirements may be higher than the margin and collateral requirements at december   if wholesale energy prices change or if emmt enters into additional transactions 
emg estimates that margin and collateral requirements for energy and congestion contracts outstanding as of december  could increase by approximately million over the remaining life of the contracts using a confidence level 
this increase may not be offset by similar changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged items in the same periods 
certain emmt hedge contracts do not require margin  but contain provisions that require emg or midwest generation to comply with the terms and conditions of their credit facilities 
the credit facilities contain financial covenants which are described further in dividend restrictions in major financings

intercompany tax allocation agreement emg and its subsidiaries  eme and edison capital  are included in the consolidated federal and combined state income tax returns of edison international and are eligible to participate in tax allocation payments with other subsidiaries of edison international in circumstances where domestic tax losses are incurred 
the right of eme and edison capital to receive and the amount of and timing of tax allocation payments are dependent on the inclusion of eme and edison capital in the consolidated income tax returns of edison international and its subsidiaries and other factors  including the consolidated taxable income of edison international and its subsidiaries  the amount of net operating losses and other tax items of emg subsidiaries  and other subsidiaries of edison international and specific procedures regarding allocation of state taxes 
eme and edison capital receive tax allocation payments for tax losses when and to the extent that the consolidated edison international group generates sufficient taxable income in order to be able to utilize eme or edison capital consolidated tax losses in the consolidated income tax returns for edison international and its subsidiaries

table of contents market risk exposures introduction emg primary market risk exposures are associated with the sale of electricity and capacity from  and the procurement of fuel for  its merchant power plants 
these market risks arise from price fluctuations of electricity  capacity  fuel  emission allowances  and transmission rights 
additionally  emg financial results can be affected by fluctuations in interest rates 
emg manages these risks in part by using derivative instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
derivative instruments emg uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to market risks that arise from price fluctuations of electricity  capacity  fuel  emission allowances  and transmission rights 
for derivative instruments recorded at fair value  changes in fair value are recognized in earnings at the end of each accounting period unless the instrument qualifies for hedge accounting 
for derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting  changes in their fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item settles and is recognized in earnings 
however  the ineffective portion of a derivative that qualifies for cash flow hedge accounting is recognized currently in earnings 
unrealized gains and losses emg classifies unrealized gains and losses from derivative instruments other than the effective portion of derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting as part of operating revenues or fuel costs 
the results of derivative activities are recorded as part of cash flows from operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the following table summarizes unrealized gains losses from non trading activities years ended december  in millions midwest generation plants non qualifying hedges ineffective portion of cash flow hedges homer city plant non qualifying hedges ineffective portion of cash flow hedges total unrealized gains losses at december   cumulative unrealized gains of million were recognized from non qualifying hedge contracts or the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges related to fair value disclosures in determining the fair value of emg derivative positions  emg uses third party market pricing where available 
for further explanation of the fair value hierarchy and a discussion of emg derivative instruments  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note fair value measurements and note derivative instruments and hedging activities  respectively 
the fair value of derivatives used for non trading purposes at december  was million 
a change in the market price of the underlying commodity at december  would increase or decrease the fair value of outstanding non trading commodity derivative instruments by approximately million 
the fair value of derivatives used for trading purposes at december  was million 
a change in the market price of the underlying commodity at december  would increase or decrease the fair value of trading contracts by approximately million 
the impact of changes to the various inputs used to determine the fair value of level derivatives would not be anticipated to be material to emg results of operations as such changes would be offset by similar changes in derivatives classified within level as well as other levels

table of contents and liabilities measured at fair value before the impact of offsetting collateral and netting as of december  commodity price risk introduction emg merchant operations create exposure to commodity price risk  which reflects the potential impact of a change in the market value of a particular commodity 
commodity price risks are actively monitored  with oversight provided by a risk management committee  to ensure compliance with emg risk management policies 
despite this  there can be no assurance that all risks have been accurately identified  measured and or mitigated 
energy price risk affecting sales from the coal plants energy and capacity from the coal plants are sold under terms  including price  duration and quantity  arranged by emmt with customers through a combination of bilateral agreements resulting from negotiations or from auctions  forward energy sales and spot market sales 
power is sold into pjm at spot prices based upon locational marginal pricing 
hedging transactions related to generation are generally entered into at the northern illinois hub  and to a lesser extent  the aep dayton hub  both in pjm  for the midwest generation plants and generally at the pjm west hub for the homer city plant 
the following table depicts the average historical market prices for energy per megawatt hour at the locations indicated hour average historical market prices midwest generation plants northern illinois hub homer city plant pjm west hub homer city busbar energy prices were calculated at the respective delivery points using historical hourly real time prices as published by pjm or provided on the pjm web site 
the following table sets forth the forward market prices for energy per megawatt hour as quoted for sales into the northern illinois hub and pjm west hub at december  hour forward energy prices northern illinois hub pjm west hub calendar strip calendar strip energy prices were determined by obtaining broker quotes and information from other public sources relating to the northern illinois hub and pjm west hub delivery points 
market price for energy purchases for the entire calendar year 
forward market prices at the northern illinois hub and pjm west hub fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including natural gas prices  transmission congestion  changes in market rules  electricity demand which in turn is affected by weather  economic growth  and other factors  plant outages in the region  and the amount of existing and planned power plant capacity 
the actual spot prices for electricity delivered by the coal plants into these markets may vary materially from the forward market prices set forth in the preceding table 
emmt engages in hedging activities for the coal plants to hedge the risk of future change in the price of electricity 
the following table summarizes the hedge positions including load requirements services 
table of contents contracts and forward contracts accounted for on the accrual basis as of december  for electricity expected to be generated in and mwh in thousands average price mwh mwh in thousands average price mwh midwest generation plants northern illinois and aep dayton hubs homer city plant  pjm west hub total the above hedge positions include forward contracts for the sale of power and futures contracts during different periods of the year and the day 
market prices tend to be higher during on peak periods and during summer months  although there is significant variability of power prices during different periods of time 
accordingly  the above hedge positions are not directly comparable to the hour northern illinois hub or pjm west hub prices set forth above 
includes hedging transactions primarily at the pjm west hub and to a lesser extent at other trading locations 
years and include hedging activities entered into by emmt for the homer city plant that are not designated under the intercompany agreements with homer city due to limitations under the sale leaseback transaction documents 
the average price mwh includes to mw for periods ranging from january  to may  at homer city sold in conjunction with load requirements services contracts 
capacity price risk under the rpm  capacity commitments are made in advance to provide a long term pricing signal for capacity resources 
the rpm is intended to provide a mechanism for pjm to meet the region need for generation capacity  while allocating the cost to load serving entities through a locational reliability charge 

table of contents the following table summarizes the status of capacity sales for midwest generation and homer city at december  other capacity sales  net of purchases rpm capacity sold in base residual auction installed capacity mw unsold capacity mw capacity sold mw average price per mw day aggregate average price per mw day mw price per mw day mw january  to may  midwest generation homer city june  to may  midwest generation homer city june  to may  midwest generation homer city june  to may  midwest generation homer city capacity not sold arises from i capacity retained to meet forced outages under the rpm auction guidelines  and ii capacity that pjm does not purchase at the clearing price resulting from the rpm auction 
excludes to mw of capacity for periods ranging from january  to may  at homer city sold in conjunction with load requirements services contracts 
other capacity sales and purchases  net includes contracts executed in advance of the rpm base residual auction to hedge the price risk related to such auction  participation in rpm incremental auctions and other capacity transactions entered into to manage capacity risks 
includes the impact of a mw capacity swap transaction executed prior to the base residual auction at per mw day 
the rpm auction capacity prices for the delivery period of june  to may  and june  to may  varied between different areas of pjm 
in the western portion of pjm  affecting midwest generation  the prices of per mw day and per mw day were substantially lower than other areas capacity prices 
the impact of lower capacity prices for these periods compared to previous years will have an adverse effect on midwest generation revenues unless such lower capacity prices are offset by an unavailability of competing resources and increased energy prices 
revenues from the sale of capacity from midwest generation and homer city beyond the periods set forth above will depend upon the amount of capacity available and future market prices either in pjm or nearby markets if emg has an opportunity to capture a higher value associated with those markets 
under pjm rpm system  the market price for capacity is generally determined by aggregate market based supply conditions and an administratively set aggregate demand curve 
among the factors influencing the supply of capacity in any particular market are plant forced outage rates  plant closings  plant delistings due to plants being removed as capacity resources and or to export capacity to other markets  capacity imports from other markets  demand side management activities and the cost of new entry 
basis risk sales made from the coal plants in the real time or day ahead market receive the actual spot prices or day ahead prices  as the case may be  at the busbars delivery points of the individual plants 
in order to mitigate price risk from changes in spot prices at the individual plant busbars  emg may enter into cash settled futures contracts as well as forward contracts with counterparties for energy to be delivered in future periods 
currently  a liquid market for entering into these contracts at the individual plant busbars does not exist 
a liquid market does exist for a settlement point at the pjm west hub in the case of the homer city plant and for settlement points at the northern illinois hub and the aep dayton hub in the case of the midwest generation plants 
emg hedging activities use these settlement points and  to a lesser extent  other similar trading hubs to enter into hedging contracts 
to the extent that  on the settlement date of a hedge contract  spot prices at the relevant busbar are lower than spot prices at the settlement point  the proceeds actually realized from the related hedge contract are effectively reduced by 
table of contents the difference 
this is referred to as basis risk 
during  transmission congestion in pjm resulted in prices at the homer city busbar being lower than those at the pjm west hub by an average of  compared to during and during during  transmission congestion in pjm resulted in prices at the individual busbars of the midwest generation plants being lower than those at the aep dayton hub and northern illinois hub by an average of and  respectively  compared to and  respectively  during by entering into cash settled futures contracts and forward contracts using the pjm west hub  the northern illinois hub  and the aep dayton hub or other similar trading hubs as settlement points  emg is exposed to basis risk as described above 
in order to mitigate basis risk  emg may purchase financial transmission rights and basis swaps in pjm for homer city and midwest generation 
a financial transmission right is a financial instrument that entitles the holder to receive the difference between actual spot prices for two delivery points in exchange for a fixed amount 
accordingly  emg hedging activities include using financial transmission rights alone or in combination with forward contracts and basis swap contracts to manage basis risk 
coal and transportation price risk the midwest generation plants and homer city plant purchase coal primarily from the southern prb of wyoming and from mines located near the facilities in pennsylvania  respectively 
coal purchases are made under a variety of supply agreements 
the following table summarizes the amount of coal under contract at december  for the following three years amount of coal under contract in millions of equivalent tons midwest generation plants homer city plant the amount of coal under contract in equivalent tons is calculated based on contracted tons and applying an  btu equivalent for the midwest generation plants and  btu equivalent for the homer city plant 
in january  midwest generation entered into additional contractual agreements for the purchase of million tons for emg is subject to price risk for purchases of coal that are not under contract 
prices of napp coal  which are related to the price of coal purchased for the homer city plant  increased during from and decreased during from the market price of napp coal with  btu per pound heat content and pounds of so per mmbtu sulfur content increased to a price of per ton at december   compared to a price of per ton at december   as reported by the eia 
in  the price of napp coal ranged from per ton to per ton  as reported by the eia 
the increase in napp coal prices was primarily driven by the export market demand and global coal pricing 
prices of prb coal with  btu per pound heat content and pounds of so per mmbtu sulfur content purchased for the midwest generation plants increased during from year end prices and declined during from year end prices 
the price of prb coal fluctuated between per ton and per ton during  with a price of per ton at december   compared to a price of per ton at december   as reported by the eia 
the increase in prb coal prices was due to the draw down of inventory levels and flat to slight declines of prb coal production 
emg has contracts for the transport of coal to its facilities 
the primary contract is with union pacific railroad and various short haul carriers  which extends through emg is exposed to price risk related to transportation rates after the expiration of its existing transportation contracts 
current market transportation rates for prb coal are higher than the existing rates under contract 
transportation costs are approximately half of the delivered cost of prb coal to the midwest generation plants 
based on emg anticipated coal requirements in in excess of the amount under contract  emg expects that a change in the price of coal at december  would increase or decrease pre tax income in by approximately million 

table of contents emission allowances price risk the federal acid rain program requires electric generating stations to hold so allowances sufficient to cover their annual emissions 
pursuant to pennsylvania and illinois implementation of the cair  the coal plants are required to hold seasonal and annual nox allowances 
in the event that actual emissions required are greater than allowances held  emg is subject to price risk for purchases of emission allowances 
the market price for emission allowances may vary significantly 
the average purchase price of so allowances was per ton in  per ton in and per ton in the average purchase price of annual nox allowances was per ton in and  per ton in based on broker quotes and information from public sources  the spot price for so allowances and annual nox allowances was per ton and per ton  respectively  at december  based on emg anticipated so requirements and annual and seasonal nox requirements for beyond those allowances already purchased  emg expects that a change in the price of so emission allowances and annual and seasonal nox emission allowances at december  would increase or decrease pre tax income in by approximately million 
credit risk for further information related to credit risk and how emg manages credit risk  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the credit risk exposure from counterparties of merchant energy hedging and trading activities is measured as the sum of net receivables accounts receivable less accounts payable and the current fair value of net derivative assets 
emg subsidiaries enter into master agreements and other arrangements in conducting such activities which typically provide for a right of setoff in the event of bankruptcy or default by the counterparty 
at december   the balance sheet exposure as described above  broken down by the credit ratings of emg counterparties  was as follows december  in millions exposure collateral net exposure credit rating a or higher a bbb bbb bbb below investment grade total emg assigns a credit rating based on the lower of a counterparty s p or moody rating 
for ease of reference  the above table uses the s p classifications to summarize risk  but reflects the lower of the two credit ratings 
exposure excludes amounts related to contracts classified as normal purchase and sales and non derivative contractual commitments that are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet  except for any related accounts receivable 
the credit risk exposure set forth in the above table is comprised of million of net accounts receivable and payables and million representing the fair value of derivative contracts 
the exposure is based on master netting agreements with the related counterparties 
due to developments in the financial markets  credit ratings may not be reflective of the actual related credit risks 
in addition to the amounts set forth in the above table  emg subsidiaries have posted a million cash margin in the aggregate with pjm  nyiso  midwest independent transmission system operator miso  clearing brokers and other counterparties to support hedging and trading activities 
the margin posted to support these activities also exposes emg to credit risk of the related entities 
the terms of emg wind turbine supply agreements contain significant obligations of the suppliers in the form of manufacturing and delivery of turbines  and payments  for delays in delivery and for failure to meet 
table of contents performance obligations and warranty agreements 
emg reliance on these contractual provisions is subject to credit risks 
generally  these are unsecured obligations of the turbine manufacturer 
a material adverse development with respect to emg turbine suppliers may have a material impact on emg wind projects and development efforts 
interest rate risk interest rate changes can affect earnings and the cost of capital for capital improvements or new investments in power projects 
emg mitigates the risk of interest rate fluctuations by arranging for fixed rate financing or variable rate financing with interest rate swaps  interest rate options or other hedging mechanisms for a number of its project financings 
a change in market interest rates at december  would increase or decrease the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements by approximately million 
the fair market values of fixed interest rate obligations are subject to interest rate risk 
the fair market value of emg consolidated long term debt including current portion was billion at december   compared to the carrying value of billion 
a increase in market interest rates at december  would result in a decrease in the fair value of total long term debt by approximately million 
a decrease in market interest rates at december  would result in an increase in the fair value of total long term debt by approximately million

the agencies are required to issue rules and regulations that implement regulation of swaps markets by july the dodd frank act subjects swaps to new mandatory clearing and trading requirements  if no exemption applies 
it may also impose capital requirements on non exempt market participants 
the clearing and trading requirements could result in increased margining requirements which may increase the costs of hedging activity

critical accounting estimates and policies the accounting policies described below are considered critical to obtaining an understanding of edison international consolidated financial statements because their application requires the use of significant estimates and judgments by management in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
management estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain and may differ significantly from actual results achieved 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires significant assumptions and changes in the estimate or  the use of alternative estimates  that could have a material impact on edison international results of operations or financial position

table of contents international accounting policies  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note summary of significant accounting policies 
rate regulated enterprises nature of estimate required 
sce follows the accounting principles for rate regulated enterprises which are required for entities whose rates are set by regulators at levels intended to recover the estimated costs of providing service  plus a return on net investment  or rate base 
regulators may also impose certain penalties or grant certain incentives 
due to timing and other differences in the collection of revenue  these principles allow a cost that would otherwise be charged as an expense by a unregulated entity to be capitalized as a regulatory asset if it is probable that such cost is recoverable through future rates  conversely the principles allow creation of a regulatory liability for amounts collected in rates to recover costs expected to be incurred in the future or amounts collected in excess of costs incurred 
key assumptions and approach used 
sce management assesses at the end of each reporting period whether regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as the current regulatory environment  the issuance of rate orders on recovery of the specific or a similar incurred cost to sce or other rate regulated entities in california  and other factors that would indicate that the regulator will treat an incurred cost as allowable for ratemaking purposes 
using these factors  management has determined that existing regulatory assets and liabilities are probable of future recovery or settlement 
this determination reflects the current regulatory climate in california and is subject to change in the future 
effect if different assumption used 
significant management judgment is required to evaluate the anticipated recovery of regulatory assets  the recognition of incentives and revenue subject to refund  as well as the anticipated cost of regulatory liabilities or penalties 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  all or part of the regulatory assets and liabilities would have to be written off against current period earnings 
at december   the consolidated balance sheets included regulatory assets of billion and regulatory liabilities of billion 
if different judgments were reached on recovery of costs and timing of income recognition  sce earnings and cash flows may vary from the amounts reported 
derivatives nature of estimates required 
as described in item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note derivative instruments and hedging activities  sce and emg use derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in electricity and fuel prices and interest rates 
derivative instruments are recorded at fair value unless certain exceptions are met in which case the derivative is recorded on an accrual basis 
sce records derivative instruments that do not meet the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value with an offsetting regulatory asset or liability due to application of principles for rate regulated enterprises 
as a result  changes in fair value of sce derivative instruments have no impact on earnings  but may temporarily affect cash flows 
sce has not elected to use hedge accounting for these transactions due to the regulatory accounting treatment 
emg records derivative instruments that do not meet the normal purchases and sales exception at fair value  with changes in the derivative fair value recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
for derivatives that qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment  the effective portion of the changes in the derivative fair value is recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
emg records derivative instruments used for trading at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in income 
management judgment is required to determine if a transaction meets the definition of a derivative and  if it does  whether the normal purchases and sales exception applies or whether individual transactions qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
management judgment is also required to determine the fair value of derivative transactions 
key assumptions and approach used 
sce and emg determine the fair value of derivative instruments based on forward market prices in active markets adjusted for nonperformance risk 
if quoted market prices are not available  internally developed models are used to determine the fair value 
when actual 
table of contents market prices  or relevant observable inputs are not available  it is appropriate to use unobservable inputs which reflect management assumptions  including extrapolating limited short term observable data and developing correlations between liquid and non liquid trading hubs 
in assessing nonperformance risks  sce and emg review credit ratings of counterparties and related default rates based on such credit ratings and prices of credit default swaps 
the market price or premium for credit default swaps represents the price that a counterparty would pay to transfer the risk of default  typically bankruptcy  to another party 
a credit default swap is not directly comparable to the credit risks of derivative contracts  but provides market information of the related risk of nonperformance 
in addition  a fair value hierarchy is established that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
for further information  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note fair value measurements 
effect if different assumptions used 
as described above  fair value is determined using a combination of market information or observable data and unobservable inputs which reflect management assumptions 
changes in observable data would impact results 
in addition  unobservable inputs could have an impact on results 
fair value for level derivatives is derived using observable and unobservable inputs 
as of december   sce and emg level derivatives had a net fair value of million and million  respectively 
while it is difficult to determine the impact of a change in any one input  if the fair value of sce and emg level derivatives were increased or decreased by  the impact would be a less than million and a million increase or decrease to operating revenues  respectively 
for derivative instruments that are measured at fair value using quantitative pricing models  a significant change in estimate could affect edison international results of operations 
for further sensitivities in edison international assumptions used to calculate fair value  see emg results of operations fair value disclosures and sce market risk exposures fair value of derivative instruments

nuclear decommissioning aro nature of estimate required 
regulations by the nrc require sce to decommission its nuclear power plants which is expected to begin after the plants operating licenses expire 
in accordance with authoritative guidance  sce is required to record an obligation to decommission its nuclear facilities 
nuclear decommissioning costs are recovered in utility rates through contributions that are reviewed every three years by the cpuc 
due to regulatory accounting treatment  nuclear decommissioning activities are not expected to affect sce earnings 
key assumptions and approach used 
the liability to decommission sce nuclear power facilities is based on site specific studies performed in and for san onofre and palo verde  respectively  which estimate that sce will spend approximately billion through to decommission its active nuclear facilities 
decommissioning cost estimates are updated in each nuclear decommissioning triennial proceeding 
the current estimate is based on the following assumptions from the and site specific study decommissioning costs 
the estimated costs for labor  dismantling and disposal costs  energy and miscellaneous costs 
escalation rates 
annual escalation rates are used to convert the decommissioning cost estimates in base year dollars to decommissioning cost estimates in future year dollars 
escalation rates are primarily used for labor  material  equipment  and low level radioactive waste burial costs 
sce current estimate is based on sce decommissioning cost methodology used for ratemaking purposes  escalated at rates ranging from to depending on the cost element annually 
timing 
cost estimates are based on an assumption that decommissioning will commence promptly after the current nrc operating licensees expire 
the operating licenses currently expire in for san onofre units and  and in  and for the palo verde units 
spent fuel dry storage costs 
cost estimates are based on an assumption that the doe will begin to take spent fuel in  and will remove the last spent fuel from the san onofre and palo verde sites 
table of contents by and  respectively 
costs for spent fuel monitoring are included until and  respectively 
changes in decommissioning technology  regulation  and economics 
the current cost studies assume the use of current technologies under current regulations and at current cost levels 
effect if different assumptions used 
the aro for decommissioning sce active nuclear facilities was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
the aro liability decrease in was mainly due to a decrease in escalation rates 
changes in the estimated costs or timing of decommissioning  or in the assumptions and judgments by management underlying these estimates  could cause material revisions to the estimated total cost to decommission these facilities which could have a material effect on the recorded liability and related regulatory asset 
the following table illustrates the increase to the aro and regulatory asset if the escalation rate was adjusted while leaving all other assumptions constant in millions increase to aro and regulatory asset at december  uniform increase in escalation rate of basis points pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions nature of estimate required 
authoritative accounting guidance requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as assets and liabilities in the balance sheet  the assets and or liabilities are normally offset through other comprehensive income loss 
in accordance with authoritative guidance for rate regulated enterprises  regulatory assets and liabilities are recorded instead of charges and credits to other comprehensive income loss for its postretirement benefit plans that are recoverable in utility rates 
edison international has a fiscal year end measurement date for all of its postretirement plans 
key assumptions of approach used 
pension and other postretirement obligations and the related effects on results of operations are calculated using actuarial models 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected return on assets  are important elements of plan expense and liability measurement 
additionally  health care cost trend rates are critical assumptions for postretirement health care plans 
these critical assumptions are evaluated at least annually 
other assumptions  which require management judgment  such as retirement  mortality and turnover  are evaluated periodically and updated to reflect actual experience 

table of contents as of december   edison international pension plans had a billion benefit obligation and total expense for these plans was million for as of december   edison international pbop plans had a billion benefit obligation and total expense for these plans was million for the following are critical assumptions used to determine expense for pension and other postretirement benefit for in millions pension plans postretirement benefits other than pensions discount rate expected long term return on plan assets assumed health care cost trend rates the discount rate enables edison international to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
edison international selects its discount rate by performing a yield curve analysis 
this analysis determines the equivalent discount rate on projected cash flows  matching the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
two corporate yield curves were considered  citigroup and aon 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets  current and expected asset allocations are considered  as well as historical and expected returns on plan assets 
a portion of pbop trusts asset returns are subject to taxation  so the rate of return on plan assets above is determined on an after tax basis 
actual time weighted  annualized returns on the pension plan assets were  and for the one year  five year and ten year periods ended december   respectively 
actual time weighted  annualized returns on the pbop plan assets were   and over these same periods 
accounting principles provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees 
the health care cost trend rate gradually declines to for and beyond 
pension expense is recorded for sce based on the amount funded to the trusts  as calculated using an actuarial method required for ratemaking purposes  in which the impact of market volatility on plan assets is recognized in earnings on a more gradual basis 
any difference between pension expense calculated in accordance with ratemaking methods and pension expense calculated in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance for pension is accumulated as a regulatory asset or liability  and will  over time  be recovered from or returned to customers 
as of december   this cumulative difference amounted to a regulatory asset of million  meaning that the accounting method has recognized more in expense than the ratemaking method since implementation of authoritative guidance for employers accounting for pensions in edison international pension and pbop plans are subject to limits established for federal tax deductibility 
sce funds its pension and pbop plans in accordance with amounts allowed by the cpuc 
executive pension plans and competitive power generation pbop plans have no plan assets 
effect if different assumptions used 
changes in the estimated costs or timing of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations  or the assumptions and judgments used by management underlying these estimates  could have a material effect on the recorded expenses and liabilities 
edison international total annual contributions for sce are recovered through cpuc approved regulatory mechanisms and are expected to be  at a minimum  equal to sce total annual expense 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the projected benefit obligation for pension by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate would increase the projected benefit obligation for pension by million 
a one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on pension plan assets would decrease the expense by million 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate for pbop would decrease the projected benefit obligation by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the discount rate for the pbop would increase the projected benefit obligation by million 
a one percentage point increase in the expected rate of return on pbop plan assets would decrease the expense by million 
increasing the health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would increase the accumulated benefit obligation as of december  by million and annual aggregate service and interest costs by million 
decreasing the health care cost trend rate by one percentage point would decrease the accumulated benefit obligation as of december  by million and annual aggregate service and interest costs by million 

table of contents income taxes nature of estimates required 
as part of the process of preparing its consolidated financial statements  edison international is required to estimate its income taxes for each jurisdiction in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current period tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within edison international consolidated balance sheet 
edison international takes certain tax positions it believes are applied in accordance with the applicable tax laws 
however  these tax positions are subject to interpretation by the irs  state tax authorities and the courts 
edison international determines its uncertain tax positions in accordance with the authoritative guidance 
key assumptions and approach used 
accounting for tax obligations requires management judgment 
management uses judgment in determining whether the evidence indicates it is more likely than not  based solely on the technical merits  that a tax position will be sustained  and to determine the amount of tax benefits to be recognized 
judgment is also used in determining the likelihood a tax position will be settled and possible settlement outcomes 
in assessing its uncertain tax positions edison international considers  among others  the following factors the facts and circumstances of the position  regulations  rulings  and case law  opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers  and the experience gained from similar tax positions 
management evaluates uncertain tax positions at the end of each reporting period and makes adjustments when warranted based on changes in fact or law 
effect if different assumptions used 
actual income taxes may differ from the estimated amounts which could have a significant impact on the liabilities  revenue and expenses recorded in the financial statements 
edison international continues to be under audit or subject to audit for multiple years in various jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of particular tax positions that involve interpretations of complex tax laws 
a tax liability has been recorded with respect to tax positions in which the outcome is uncertain and the effect is estimable 
such liabilities are based on judgment and a final determination could take many years from the time the liability is recorded 
furthermore  settlement of tax positions included in open tax years may be resolved by compromises of tax positions based on current factors and business considerations that may result in material adjustments to income taxes previously estimated 
see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note income taxes for a further discussion on income taxes 
impairment of long lived assets nature of estimates required 
long lived assets  including intangible assets  are evaluated for impairment in accordance with applicable authoritative guidance 
authoritative guidance requires that if the undiscounted expected future cash flow from a company assets or group of assets without interest charges is less than its carrying value  asset impairment must be recognized on the financial statements 
the impairment charges  if applicable  are calculated as the excess of the asset carrying value over its fair value  which represents the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the asset or  in the case of assets expected to be sold  at fair value less costs to sell 
long lived assets for impairment are evaluated whenever indicators of impairment exist or when there is a commitment to sell or dispose of the asset 
these evaluations may result from significant decreases in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  as well as economic or operational analyses 
key assumptions and approach used 
the assessment of impairment requires significant management judgment to determine if an indicator of impairment has occurred  how assets should be grouped  the forecast of undiscounted expected future cash flow over the asset estimated useful life to determine if an impairment exists  and if an impairment exists  the fair value of the asset or asset group 
factors that are considered important  which could trigger an impairment  include operating losses from a project  projected future operating losses  the financial condition of counterparties  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
the determination of fair value requires management to apply judgment in estimating future prices of energy and capacity in wholesale energy markets and fuel prices 
table of contents that are susceptible to significant change  environmental and maintenance expenditures  and the time period due to the length of the estimated remaining useful lives 
effect if different assumptions used 
the estimates and assumptions used to determine whether an impairment exists are subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
the estimated fair value of an asset would change materially if different estimates and assumptions were used to determine the amounts or timing of future revenues  environmental compliance costs or operating expenditures 
application to emg merchant coal fired power plants weak commodity prices combined with continuing  heightened public policy pressure on coal generation have resulted in continuing uncertainties for merchant coal fired power plants  which may require significant capital and increased operating costs to meet environmental requirements 
for a discussion of environmental requirements  see item edison international notes to consolidated financial statements note regulatory and environmental developments management has reviewed long term cash flow forecasts that include assumptions about future electricity and fuel prices  future capacity payments under the pjm rpm  and future capital expenditure requirements under different scenarios 
assumptions included in the long term cash flow forecasts include observable market prices for electricity and fuel to the extent available and long term prices developed based on a fundamental price model  long term capacity prices based on the assumption that the pjm rpm capacity market would continue consistent with its current structure  with expected increases in revenues as a result of declines in reserve margins beyond the price of the latest auctions  and plans for compliance with both existing and possible future environmental regulations 
if electricity and capacity prices do not increase consistent with the fundamental forecast or if emg decides not to install additional environmental control equipment and  instead  shuts down one or more coal fired power plants  the forecasted cash flow would be less than expected and impairment may result 
emg includes allocated acquired emission allowances as part of each power plant asset group 
in the case of the powerton and joliet stations  emg also includes prepaid rent in the respective asset group 
emg unit of account is at the plant level and  accordingly  the closure of a unit at a multi unit site would not result in an impairment of property  plant and equipment unless such condition were to affect an impairment assessment on the entire plant 
the following table summarizes the net book value of the merchant coal fired asset groups at december  in millions midwest generation plants crawford station fisk station joliet station powerton station waukegan station will county station homer city plant accounting for contingencies  guarantees and indemnities nature of estimates required 
edison international records loss contingencies when it determines that the outcome of future events is probable of occurring and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when a guarantee or indemnification subject to authoritative guidance is entered into  edison international records a liability for the estimated fair value of the underlying guarantee or indemnification 
gain contingencies are recognized in the financial statements when they are realized 

table of contents key assumptions and approach used 
the determination of a reserve for a loss contingency is based on management judgment and estimates with respect to the likely outcome of the matter  including the analysis of different scenarios 
liabilities are recorded or adjusted when events or circumstances cause these judgments or estimates to change 
in assessing whether a loss is a reasonable possibility  edison international may consider the following factors  among others the nature of the litigation  claim or assessment  available information  opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisors  and the experience gained from similar cases 
edison international provides disclosures for material contingencies when there is a reasonable possibility that a loss or an additional loss may be incurred 
some guarantees and indemnifications could have a significant financial impact under certain circumstances  and management also considers the probability of such circumstances occurring when estimating the fair value 
effect if different assumptions used 
actual amounts realized upon settlement of contingencies may be different than amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on the liabilities  revenue and expenses recorded on the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  for guarantees and indemnities actual results may differ from the amounts recorded and disclosed and could have a significant impact on edison international consolidated financial statements
