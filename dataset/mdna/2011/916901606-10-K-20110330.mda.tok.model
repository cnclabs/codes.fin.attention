we do not undertake to update  revise or correct any of the forward looking information 
readers are cautioned that such forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under the heading risk factors beginning on page financial condition and results of operations comparison of twelve months ended december   and production and production costs 
our uranium production was zero in   pounds in and  pounds in in and we saw a decline in vasquez production and the start up of production from our kingsville dome project 
the vasquez project was mined out in and existing wellfields at kingsville dome completed production in the second quarter of production at our rosita project was suspended in october because of high cost of production combined with lower uranium prices 
although technically challenging  we believe the reserves from rosita can be produced economically with higher uranium prices 
we completed production at the vasquez project in the fourth quarter of and we shut in production at the kingsville dome project in the second quarter of the vasquez project and is now being restored 
at the kingsville dome and rosita projects  we shut in production to conserve the in place reserve base in response to a drop in uranium market prices 
we do not intend to resume production at these sites until there is a significant recovery of uranium prices 

table of contents the following table details our production and production cost breakdown for the year ended december   and kingsville dome production vasquez production rosita production total production total operating costs per pound operating costs n a total depreciation and depletion costs per pound dd a cost n a total production cost production cost per pound n a total operating costs  total depreciation and depletion costs and total production costs incurred for the periods presented above differ from the cost of uranium sales recorded in consolidated statements of operations because of changes in the amounts recorded to inventory for the same periods 
the cost of uranium sales include the sales of uranium inventory on hand at the beginning of the period and do not include uranium produced during the period but not sold at period end 
the following table provides a reconciliation of production costs to cost of uranium sales for the year ended december   and operating costs change in uranium inventory operating expense for uranium production sold depreciation and depletion costs change in uranium inventory depreciation and depletion for uranium production sold total production costs change in uranium inventory direct cost of uranium production sold the costs incurred in for operations and depreciation depletion resulted from stand by  maintenance and monitoring activities at our rosita and kingsville dome projects 
total expenditures for direct production costs in were significantly lower than as a result of the scale back of production during the year when compared to the reduced production in resulted from the decline in uranium prices throughout which led to the company decision in october to defer new wellfield development 
our direct production costs in increased compared with these increases resulted from production being sourced from higher cost kingsville dome and vasquez wellfields in and from the unfavorable results we saw from our rosita production during uranium sales 
we had no uranium sales in in  we sold a total of  pounds of uranium produced from our kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita projects  resulting in revenue of million 
in  we sold a total of  pounds of uranium produced from our kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita projects  resulting in revenue of million 

table of contents cost of uranium sales 
our costs incurred in for operations and depreciation depletion resulted from stand by  maintenance and monitoring activities at our rosita and kingsville dome projects during the year 
our direct production costs for uranium sales made in and was million and million  respectively 
our total cost of uranium sales is comprised of such production costs  including operating expenses  depreciation and depletion expenses  and also includes royalties and commissions related to our uranium sales  amortization of our restoration and reclamation cost estimates  exploration costs incurred during the year and impairment provisions for uranium properties 
the following table details our production and royalties commissions cost of uranium sales breakdown for the years ended december   and total pounds sold total operating expenses per pound operating expense n a depreciation and depletion per pound dd a expense n a direct cost of sales direct cost of sales per pound n a royalties and commissions royalties and commissions per pound n a production costs in were significantly lower than as a result of the scale back of production during the year when compared to as a result of lower sales  royalties and commissions were lower in than our average cost of pounds sold in was per pound  with kingsville dome production contributing approximately of total pounds sold  vasquez contributing approximately of total pounds sold and rosita contributing approximately of total pounds sold during the year 
royalties and commissions 
there were no royalties or commissions incurred in during  royalties and commissions were  representing of sales 
during  royalties and commissions for kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita were million  representing of sales 
the changes in royalty percentages from to resulted primarily from the changes in uranium sales prices year to year and the source of our production in each year 
our vasquez leases contain a sliding scale royalty with percentages that range from up to depending on our sales prices 
our kingsville dome leases have a royalty and carry an additional royalty payment to certain land owners 
our rosita leases contain a royalty 
operating expenses 
during we incurred operating expenses related to our south texas projects of  all such costs were from stand by and or care and maintenance activities 
during  operating expenses for kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita were million which included  of stand by and other operating costs at our south texas projects  which were charged to operations 
during  operating expenses were million 
in we incurred  of stand by costs at the rosita project  which were charged to operations 
depreciation and depletion 
during we incurred deprecation and depletion expense related to our south texas projects of  all such costs were from stand by and or care and maintenance activities 
during  we incurred depreciation and depletion expense of million compared to million during impairment of uranium properties 
during  and  we determined the carrying value of our uranium project assets exceeded their fair value 
in  this resulted in an impairment provision of  and we reduced the carrying value of kingsville dome by  rosita by  and vasquez by  at december  in  we recorded an impairment provision 
table of contents of million  and we reduced the carrying value of kingsville dome by million  rosita by  vasquez by  and other south texas projects by  at december  in our impairment provision totaled million reducing the carrying value of kingsville dome by million  rosita by million and vasquez by million at december  accretion and amortization of future restoration costs 
during  and  the accretion and amortization of future restoration costs was   and  respectively 
general and administrative charges 
we incurred general and administrative charges and corporate depreciation of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
significant expenditures for general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and were year ended amounts in s stock compensation expense salaries and payroll burden legal  accounting  public company expenses provision for legal settlement write off of target acquisition costs insurance and bank fees consulting and professional services office expenses travel and other expenses total the non cash compensation expense recorded for the years ended december   and resulted from the recognition of expense related to the fair value of the company stock option grants 
the value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected term of the option award and stock price volatility 
the expected term of options granted was derived from historical data on our employee exercise and post vesting employment termination experience 
the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the increases in salary and payroll burden in resulted primarily from a change in executive level personnel in late  the reinstatement of the non cash portion of executive level salaries in the nd half of  the payment of performance related bonuses in and a increase in medical premium costs for the plan year 
significant reductions in salary and payroll costs were made in compared with the  or decrease resulted primarily from a reduction in personnel headcount that resulted from lower activities created by the shut down of the company production during the current year 
the company legal  accounting and public company expenses increased by  in compared with these increases resulted from legal fees related to the saenz lawsuit  the recording of our regulatory fees as g a costs in because of our no longer being in active uranium production during the year  increased board of director fees related to the addition of a board member in january and an increase in the number of meetings held during the year and higher accounting fees related to services performed for the audit of the company k plan 
the company legal  accounting and public company expenses decreased  in compared with 
table of contents the decrease resulted from reduced audit and sarbanes oxley section sox related costs during the year that were partially offset by increases in legal fees 
in september   we recorded million in settlement of the lawsuit titled  saenz v 
uri inc the payment of million in cash included amounts for prior royalties that the plaintiffs had previously rejected 
the payment was made in february  upon the execution of amendments to the leases and to documentation of other aspects of the settlement and dismissal of the suit 
insurance costs increased in primarily because of increase in director and officer liability premiums in compared to insurance costs decreased in compared to as a result of lower general liability and umbrella coverage premiums because of reductions in payroll during the year 
consulting and professional service expenses in were lower than by  this reduction resulted primarily because fees incurred in for new mexico legacy and site and property characterization activities were not repeated in consulting and professional service expenses were reduced significantly in compared to the prior year as a result of lower public relations costs associated with new mexico community relations and community information education activities 
this reduced spending resulted in savings of approximately  year over year 
reduced office related costs in resulted from executive search fees and employee allowances paid in that were not incurred in reduced office related costs in resulted from closures of the company new mexico and corpus christi office locations along with peripheral office related cost reductions resulting from the reductions in work force seen in write off of target acquisition costs 
in june  the company and billiton investment bv agreed to terminate our agreement to purchase rio algom mining  llc  which was entered into on october  in connection with the targeted acquisition  we incurred costs of million dollars which were originally recorded as an asset 
upon the termination of the agreement these pre acquisition costs were expensed in net income loss 
for the year ended december  we had a net loss of million compared to net losses of million and million in and  respectively 
on a diluted per share basis  losses were in  in and in these losses in  and include an impairment provision for the kingsville dome  vasquez and rosita projects of  million and million  respectively and exploration charges of   and million  respectively 
cash flow 
as of december  we had a cash balance of approximately million compared with approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
in  we had a negative cash flow from operations of million  resulting primarily from our cessation of uranium production in and the related lack of uranium sales during the year 
in  we had a negative cash flow from operations of million  resulting primarily from low uranium production and related sales volumes 
in  we generated million of cash flow from operations  resulting from our uranium production activities during the year 
in  we raised net proceeds of approximately million through the sale of  shares 
in the june july period we issued  shares at per share and in november  shares at per share in underwritten public offerings 
in  we raised net proceeds of approximately million through the sale of  shares at per share in may and  from the issuance of  shares from the exercise of employee stock options 

table of contents during we used million in investing activities  which includes million of capital additions for the acquisition of exploration property in south texas 
additionally  we increased the collateral required for our financial surety obligation by  during the year 
the deferral of wellfield development activities resulted in our capital expenditures used in investing activities being reduced by approximately million to  in compared to we also used million in investing activities in  including million of capital additions for our south texas production projects 
these expenditures consisted primarily of wellfield evaluation  delineation and development costs of million and plant and equipment additions of  at kingsville dome 
wellfield evaluation and development costs were million and plant and equipment additions totaled million at the rosita project during costs at the vasquez project were  in and were primarily for wellfield development and land holding costs and we spent approximately  for evaluation and delineation activities at the company rosita south project during liquidity cash sources and uses for as of december   the company had million in cash and our cash balance at february  was approximately million 
the company is not currently conducting uranium production activities and has no uranium inventory 
the company is not projecting any sales revenue and related cash inflows for during we significantly strengthened our balance sheet through the capital raises completed during the year 
the approximately million raised in has positioned the company to move forward with its near term plans in south texas and new mexico and we expect that our current financial resources will allow us to maintain the company liquidity for a period of twelve to fifteen months 
while the company believes it has sufficient capital resources to sustain its operating plans  as part of its strategy  it continues to seek opportunities to expand its resource base in both new mexico and south texas and such activities would require it to seek additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that such activities will result in the acquisition of new properties or that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to allow the company to move forward with such activities 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has obtained financial surety relating to certain of its future restoration and reclamation obligations as required by the state of texas regulatory agencies 
the company has bank letters of credit the l cs and performance bonds issued for the benefit of the company to satisfy such regulatory requirements 
the l cs were issued by bank of america and the performance bonds have been issued by united states fidelity and guaranty company usf g 
l cs for   and  at december   and  respectively such l cs are collateralized in their entirety by certificates of deposit 
performance bonds totaling  were issued for the benefit of the company at december   and usf g has required that the company deposit funds collateralizing a portion of the bonds 
the amount of bonding issued by usf g exceeded the amount of collateral by million at december   and  respectively 
in the event that usf g is required to perform under its bonds or the bonds are called by the state agencies  the company would be obligated to pay any expenditure in excess of the collateral 

table of contents contractual obligations the table below sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of future payments relating to our most significant contractual obligations as of december   except as otherwise noted 
payment due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years capital leases corporate office lease crownpoint total critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements on page f of this form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies involve those requiring the use of significant estimates and assumptions in determining values or projecting future costs 
specifically regarding our uranium properties  significant estimates were utilized in determining the carrying value of these assets 
these assets have been recorded at their estimated net realizable value for impairment purposes  which is less than our cost 
the actual value realized from these assets may vary significantly from these estimates based upon market conditions  financing availability and other factors 
regarding our reserve for future restoration and reclamation costs  significant estimates were utilized in determining the future costs to complete the groundwater restoration and surface reclamation at our mine sites 
the actual cost to conduct these activities may vary significantly from these estimates 
such estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period 
the accounts of the company are maintained in united states dollars 
all dollar amounts in the financial statements are stated in united states dollars except where indicated 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asc  improving disclosures about fair value measurements asc 
these new disclosures require entities to separately disclose amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements for level  entities should present separate information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
our adoption of the disclosures  excluding the level activity disclosures  did not have a material impact on the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we are still evaluating the impact of the level disclosure requirements on the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk uranium price volatility the company is subject to market risk related to the market price of uranium 
we have two uranium supply contracts whose pricing mechanisms are based upon the market price of uranium 
future sales under these contracts would be impacted by both spot and long term uranium price fluctuations 
the company cash flow has historically been dependent on the price of uranium  which is determined primarily by global supply and demand  relative to the company costs of production 
historically  uranium prices have been subject to fluctuation  and the price of uranium has been and will continue to be affected by numerous factors beyond the company control  including the demand for nuclear power  political and economic conditions  and governmental legislation in uranium producing and consuming countries and production levels and costs of production of other producing companies 
the spot market price for uranium has demonstrated a large range since january prices have risen from per pound at january to a high of per pound as of june the spot market price was per pound as of march
