management s discussion and analysis should be read together with the consolidated financial statements and notes included in this report 
dollar and number of share amounts contained in this discussion and elsewhere in this annual report on form k are in thousands  except per share amounts 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us gaap requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note  operations and summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions described below are those that we consider to be most critical to an understanding of our financial statements because they involve significant judgments and uncertainties 
all of these estimates reflect our best judgment about current  and for some estimates future  economic and market conditions and their effects based on information available as of the date of these financial statements 
as estimates are updated or actual amounts are known  our critical accounting estimates are revised  and operating results may be affected by the revised estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures in this management s discussion and analysis 
revenue recognition woodward recognizes revenue upon shipment or delivery of tangible products for sale 
delivery is upon completion of manufacturing  customer acceptance  and the transfer of the risks and rewards of ownership 
in countries whose laws provide for retention of some form of title by sellers  enabling recovery of goods in the event of customer default on payment  product delivery is considered to have occurred when the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership of the products 
occasionally  woodward transfers title of product to customers  but retains substantive performance obligations such as completion of product testing  customer acceptance or in some instances regulatory acceptance 
in these instances  revenue is deferred until the performance obligations are satisfied 
judgment is sometimes required to identify the point in time at which the customer has assumed the risks and rewards of ownership 

table of contents woodward provides certain development services to customers under fully funded and partially funded long and short term development contracts 
revenue for such contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion  milestone or completed contract methods 
funded development contracts may be fixed price or cost reimbursable contracts 
anticipated losses on fully funded contracts  if any  are recognized in the period in which the losses become probable and estimable 
revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method requires accurate estimation of total costs to complete the development project  which requires judgment and is subject to revision 
revenue recognition under the milestone method requires identification of meaningful milestones with economic substance consistent with the revenue recognition criteria 
purchase accounting woodward consummated one acquisition during fiscal year for a total cost of  which included the acquisition of  in marketable securities  and three acquisitions during fiscal year for a total cost of  in addition  we sold the f p product line  which was acquired as part of the acquisitions  for net proceeds of approximately  significant assumptions and estimates  including projections of future cash flows  affect the carrying value of acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including inventories and other tangible and intangible assets 
changes in the carrying amounts of acquired assets and assumed liabilities may change the carrying value of goodwill  which is not amortized for accounting purposes 
changes in the carrying amount of acquired assets and assumed liabilities may also impact future costs and may subject the company to risk of future impairment of the recorded fair values of assets acquired  including goodwill 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using methods that approximate a first in  first out basis 
customer specific information and contractual terms are considered when evaluating lower of cost or market considerations 
the carrying value of inventory as of september  was  if economic conditions  customer product mix or other factors significantly reduce future customer demand for our products from forecast levels  then future adjustments to the carrying value of inventory may become necessary 
we attempt to maintain inventory quantities at levels considered necessary to fill expected orders in a reasonable time frame  which we believe mitigates our exposure to future inventory carrying cost adjustments 
postretirement benefits the company provides various benefits to certain employees through defined benefit plans and other postretirement benefit plans 
for financial reporting purposes  net periodic benefits expense and related obligations are calculated using a number of significant actuarial assumptions  including anticipated discount rates  rates of compensation increases  long term return on defined benefit plan investments  and anticipated healthcare cost increases 
based on these actuarial assumptions  at september  our recorded liabilities include  for underfunded defined benefit pension plans and  for unfunded other postretirement benefit plans 
changes in net periodic expense or the amounts of recorded liabilities may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
estimates of the value of postretirement benefit obligations  and related net periodic benefits expense  are dependent on actuarial assumptions including future interest rates  compensation rates  healthcare cost trends  and returns on defined benefit plan investments 
variances from our fiscal year end estimates for these variables could materially affect our recognized postretirement benefit obligation liabilities 
on a near term basis  such changes are unlikely to have a material impact on reported earnings  since such adjustments are recorded to other comprehensive income and recognized into expense over a number of years 
significant changes in estimates could  however  materially affect the carrying amounts of benefit obligation liabilities  including accumulated benefit obligations  which could affect compliance with the provisions of our debt arrangements and future borrowing capacity 
reviews for impairment of goodwill at september   we had  of goodwill  representing of our total assets 
goodwill is tested for impairment on the reporting unit level on an annual basis and more often if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the impairment tests consist of comparing the fair value of reporting units  determined using discounted cash flows  with its carrying amount including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to its implied fair value 
there was no impairment charge recorded in fiscal years  or 
table of contents in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the company prospectively changed its goodwill testing date from march to july to better align its impairment testing procedures with the completion of its annual financial and strategic planning process as discussed in note  goodwill  to the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  during fiscal year  woodward tested its goodwill for impairment as of march  and july  and concluded that there was no impairment of the carrying value of the goodwill 
the change in accounting principle related to changing the annual goodwill impairment testing date did not accelerate  delay  avoid  or cause an impairment charge 
as of march and july   woodward determined its turbine systems  airframe systems and engine systems operating segments represented individual reporting units 
woodward determined that its electrical power systems operating segment included three components that represented reporting units as of march  and four components that represented reporting units as of july  due to the acquisition of ids 
the fair value of each of woodward s reporting units was determined using a discounted cash flow method 
this method represents a level input and incorporates various estimates and assumptions  the most significant being projected revenue growth rates  operating earnings margins  and forecasted cash flows based on the discount rate and terminal growth rate 
management projects revenue growth rates  operating earnings margins and cash flows based on each reporting unit s current operational results  expected performance and operational strategies over a five or ten year period 
these projections are adjusted to reflect current economic conditions and demand for certain products  and require considerable management judgment 
forecasted cash flows for the july  impairment testing were discounted using weighted average cost of capital assumptions from to 
the terminal values of the forecasted cash flows were calculated using the gordon growth model and assumed an annual compound growth rate after five or ten years of 
forecasted cash flows for the march  impairment testing were discounted using weighted average cost of capital assumption of and an annual compound growth rate after five years of 
these inputs  which are unobservable in the market  represent management s estimate of what market participants would use in determining the present value of the company s forecasted cash flows 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can have a significant impact on the fair value of forecasted cash flows 
woodward evaluated the reasonableness of the reporting units resulting fair values utilizing a market multiple method 
the results of woodward s annual goodwill impairment test performed as of july   indicated the estimated fair value of each reporting unit was substantially in excess of its carrying value  and accordingly  no impairment existed 
increasing the discount rate by  decreasing the growth rate by  or decreasing forecasted cash flow by  would not have resulted in an impairment charge at july  see note  segment information  in the consolidated financial statements 
as part of the company s ongoing monitoring efforts  woodward will continue to consider the global economic environment and its potential impact on woodward s business in assessing goodwill recoverability 
there can be no assurance that woodward s estimates and assumptions regarding forecasted cash flows of certain reporting units  the period or strength of the current economic recovery  or the other inputs used in forecasting the present value of forecasted cash flows will prove to be accurate projections of future performance 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
the reserves are established when we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be fully sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit or refinement of an estimate 
although we believe our reserves are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will be consistent with what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded  such differences will impact the provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 
as of september   unrecognized gross tax benefits for which recognition has been deferred was  significant judgment is also required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
in the event we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized  we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made 
as of september   our valuation allowance was  
table of contents our effective tax rates differ from the us statutory rate primarily due to the tax impact of foreign operations  adjustments of valuation allowances  research tax credits  state taxes  and tax audit settlements 
our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be affected by earnings that are different than anticipated in countries which have lower or higher tax rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  by transfer pricing adjustments  by tax effects of share based compensation  and or changes in tax laws  regulations  and accounting principles  including accounting for uncertain tax positions  or interpretations thereof 
in addition  we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the us internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these examinations will not have a significant effect on our operating results  financial condition  and cash flows 
business environment and trends we serve the aerospace and energy markets 
aerospace markets our aerospace products are primarily used to provide energy and motion control in both commercial and military fixed wing and rotary aircraft and in various other defense platforms  including guided weapon systems and combat vehicles 
commercial and civil aircraft in the commercial aerospace markets  global air traffic continued to improve in fiscal year commercial aircraft production has increased as aircraft operators continue to take delivery of more fuel efficient aircraft and retire older  less efficient aircraft 
this trend toward more fuel efficient aircraft favors our product offerings because we generally have more content on the new generation of aircraft 
while relatively long development cycles mean the impacts are several years delayed  we have recently been awarded content on the boeing max  and  airbus aneo  bombardier cseries  comac  bell and a variety of business jet platforms 
we continue to explore opportunities on new engine and aircraft programs that are under consideration or have been recently announced 
defense in the defense markets  overall spending decreased modestly in our involvement with a wide variety of military programs in fixed wing aircraft  rotorcraft and weapons systems has provided relative stability for our defense markets sales 
key programs that have been stable or growing include the f a e f  the f joint strike fighter  and the black hawk and apache helicopter programs 
in fiscal year  we were awarded motion control system content for the fueling boom on the kc tanker program 
military aftermarket  tied to the support of ongoing us war efforts  has been steady throughout this cycle 
we continue to explore opportunities on next generation smart weapon systems  including enhanced guided bomb and guided rocket programs  turret controls and remote weapon stations 
weapon programs for which we have significant sales include the jdam guided tactical weapon system and the ma abrams tank turret control system 
energy markets our energy products are used in global power generation and distribution  and to control energy in industrial  mobile and marine equipment 
industrial turbines and compressors in fiscal year  the industrial turbine market began to recover from the economic downturn that began in fiscal year in addition to increased production rates by our oem customers  we gained content on a newer generation of turbines that deliver improved fuel efficiency and lower emissions 
in addition  we increased market share by successfully adding customers for our product offerings 
we anticipate that long term power needs in developed and developing regions  as well as backup power for renewable resource generators such as wind turbines  should cause industrial turbine demand to continue to improve 
the aftermarket segment of the industry has been favorably impacted by service needs related to turbine installations early in the preceding decade 
as power generation demand continues to improve  turbines are expected to provide a compelling solution due to their inherent low emissions and fast permitting and construction times  along with the abundant availability of reasonably priced natural gas 
further  gas turbines are expected to serve a critical market need in supporting renewable assets in providing fast start and load acceptance during times when renewable sources fluctuate 
oem turbine manufacturers appear to be investing in new technologies focused on emissions  part load operation  start times  and fuel flexibility 
in the oil and gas process industry  demand for industrial gas  steam turbines and compressors is expected to grow  primarily due to increased demand for oil and natural gas products 
exploration  production  distribution and processing of oil and gas products utilize both gas and steam turbines  as well as compressors 
increased construction of floating production storage and offloading  and gas to liquids facilities is expected to drive demand in aeroderivative  steam turbine and compressor applications 

table of contents reciprocating engines the economic recovery we began to see in fiscal year continued strongly in fiscal year  primarily due to increased demand for mining and other industrial equipment while demand for power generation and marine engines began to improve 
demand for small gas and diesel engines  including engines used in alternative fuel vehicles and industrial equipment  continued to recover throughout fiscal year as equipment manufacturers increased their production schedules 
we believe orders for construction  agricultural  and material handling equipment  particularly in asia  are driving demand for small diesel engines  and interest in using non petroleum alternative fuels particularly in korea  china and india is driving demand for small gas engines 
demand for large gas and diesel engines stabilized in fiscal year  and we began to recover in these markets in fiscal year we believe that broad commodity demand is driving continued investments in engine powered mining  oil and natural gas production equipment 
demand for large engine marine applications stabilized and showed some improvement in fiscal year longer term  government issued emissions requirements across many regions and engine applications is driving demand for higher technology control systems  as is customer demand for improved engine efficiencies 
energy policies in some countries encourage the use of natural gas and other alternative fuels over carbon rich petroleum fuels  thereby increasing demand for our alternative fuel clean engine control technologies 
wind energy the wind energy industry remains challenged as a result of concerns regarding government support  competitive pricing  and capacity and availability in the credit markets 
in the longer term  we anticipate improvement in the market as demand for low emission power sources increases and technology advancements allow renewable energy to be more competitive with conventional sources 
in fiscal year  we increased market share with existing wind customers and added new wind customers 
also in fiscal year  we added solar capabilities through our ids acquisition 
electrical power generation and distribution the electrical power generation and distribution markets began to recover in fiscal year as credit markets and global energy demand improved despite a continued tight global credit market and uncertainty over government stimulus packages 
we are seeing improving demand for our power sensing and control equipment in line with the global recovery in these markets 
the global economic recovery  especially in developing economies  is beginning to drive increased global power demand 
after a strong fiscal year  we experienced a modest decline in the level of our project engineering services

details of the changes in consolidated net external sales are as follows consolidated net external sales at september  aerospace volume changes aerospace customer funded development energy volume changes price changes and sales mix effects of changes in foreign currency consolidated net external sales at september  
table of contents the increase in net external sales in fiscal year was attributable to sales volume increases across both of our segments 
customer funded development decreased slightly in the aerospace segment 
net external sales for fiscal year were also impacted by favorable price changes and foreign currency exchange rates 
sales for fiscal year continued the growth trend we began to experience in the second half of fiscal year in addition  the global supply chain has begun to recover some from capacity constraints introduced as the global economy struggled in the past several years 
we remain focused on meeting customer demand on a timely basis  managing our inventory levels  and coordinating with vendors 
price changes increases in selling prices across several products were partially offset by decreases in selling prices for some wind related products 
selling price changes are in response to prevailing market conditions 
foreign currency exchange rates our worldwide sales activities are primarily denominated in us dollars usd  european monetary units the euro  great britain pounds gbp  japanese yen jpy  chinese yuan cny and swiss francs chf 
as the usd  euro  gbp  jpy  cny  and chf fluctuate against each other and other currencies  we are exposed to gains or losses on sales transactions 
if the cny  which the chinese government has not historically allowed to fluctuate significantly against usd  is allowed to fluctuate against usd in the future  we would be exposed to gains or losses on sales transactions denominated in cny 
during the fiscal year ended september   our net sales were positively impacted by approximately  due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  compared to the same period of fiscal year costs and expenses compared to variable compensation expense  which is tied to relative financial and operating performance  can vary significantly from fiscal year to year 
during fiscal year  variable compensation expense increased  as compared to fiscal year and has impacted cost of goods sold  selling general and administrative  and research and development expenses 
cost of goods sold increased by  to  or of net sales  for fiscal year from  or of net sales  for fiscal year correspondingly  gross margins as measured by net sales less cost of goods sold  divided by net sales remained relatively flat at for fiscal year as compared to for the same period of the prior fiscal year 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased by  or  to  for fiscal year as compared to  for fiscal year primarily as a result of increased variable compensation 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of net sales to for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year included in selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal year is approximately  related to the acquisition of ids 
research and development costs increased by  or  to  for fiscal year as compared to  for the same period of fiscal year research and development costs increased as a percentage of net sales to for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year our research and development activities extend across nearly our entire customer base 
the increase in research and development costs is primarily due to our investment in new product platforms that have been awarded and development of next generation technology 
research and development costs in fiscal year were also impacted by increased variable compensation 
amortization of intangible assets decreased slightly to  for fiscal year compared to  for fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  amortization of intangible assets decreased to for fiscal year as compared to for the prior year 
interest expense decreased to  or of net sales  for fiscal year compared to  or of net sales  for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in interest expense is due to related debt reductions 

table of contents income taxes were provided at an effective rate on earnings before income taxes of for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the change in the effective tax rate as a percentage of earnings before income taxes was attributable to the following effective tax rate at september  retroactive extension of research credit recorded in fiscal research credit in fiscal as compared to fiscal adjustment of prior period tax issues recorded in the period ending september  adjustment of prior period tax issues recorded in the period ending september  domestic production activities deduction foreign tax rate differences other changes  net effective tax rate at september  during the year ending september   the internal revenue service concluded an examination of our us federal income tax returns for fiscal years and during the year ending september   we completed certain internal revaluation assessments and certain statues of limitations expired 
as a result  we reduced our liability for unrecognized tax benefits by a net favorable amount of  for the period ended june  on december   legislation was enacted that retroactively extended the us research tax credit  which had expired as of december  as a result of this extension  fiscal year includes the effect of recognizing a tax benefit of  related to recognition of the retroactive impact to the prior year 
the credit is scheduled to expire again on december  this expiration will result in a higher effective tax rate in fiscal year unless legislation is enacted to extend the credit 
in january  the state of illinois increased its corporate income tax rate from to effective january  this tax rate increase has not had a material impact on woodward s consolidated financial statements and is not expected to have a material impact in the future 
the total amount of the gross liability for worldwide unrecognized tax benefits reported in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet was  at september   and  at september  at september   the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact woodward s effective tax rate  if recognized  was  at this time  we estimate it is reasonably possible that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by as much as in the next twelve months due primarily to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense

sales for the aerospace aftermarket continued to benefit from increased passenger and cargo air traffic  and the introduction of new aircraft platforms on which aerospace products are used 
we believe the fleet dynamics of commercial aircraft platforms on which we have content  such as the airbus a  the boeing  the embraer and the bombardier to seat regional jets  allowed our aftermarket business to be somewhat less negatively impacted by the effects of the recent economic down cycle than some of our competitors and have supported sales growth as a result of the more recent rebound in air traffic 
commercial oem aircraft deliveries of narrow body and wide body aircraft have increased based on improved airline demand and new product introduction 
the increase in sales continues to reflect recovering demand for business and regional jets and rotorcraft  partially offset by a slight decline in military sales and reduced levels of customer funded development revenue

in addition  we continued to see growth in our industrial steam turbine market  as well as increased deliveries of wind turbine power converters 
although wind turbine converter sales increased in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  wind converter demand continues to be impacted by tight lender requirements for project financing and uncertainty regarding government stimulus programs due to a lack of clear policy direction in the us and elsewhere

some volatility is anticipated going forward due to continued uncertainty and some continued softness in certain market segments 
fluctuations in customer order volumes for certain products  coupled with our vendors reduction of their production capacities as global demand has fallen  and continued tight credit constraints impacting our suppliers have complicated our management of the overall global supply chain 
meeting customer demand on a timely basis  managing our inventory levels  and coordinating with vendors are key tactical initiatives as we manage our business during the emerging economic recovery
