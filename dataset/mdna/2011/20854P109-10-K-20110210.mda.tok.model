additional adjustments either increases or decreases may be required as we further develop title to and further confirm our rights with respect to our various properties in anticipation of development 
we believe that our assumptions and methodology in this regard are reasonable 
we enter into physical gas sales transactions with various counterparties for terms varying in length 
reserves and production estimates are believed to be sufficient to satisfy these obligations 
in the past  other than interstate pipeline outages related to maintenance issues or a weather related force majeure event  we have not failed to deliver quantities required under contract 
we also enter into various gas swap transactions that qualify as financial cash flow hedges 
these gas swap transactions exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions and represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
as of december   we expect these transactions will cover approximately billion cubic feet of our estimated production at an average price of per thousand cubic feet  billion cubic feet of our estimated production at an average price of per thousand cubic feet  billion cubic feet of our estimated production at an average price of per thousand cubic feet  and billion cubic feet of our estimated production at an average price of per thousand cubic feet

in addition  consol energy acquired extensive gathering assets in the dominion acquisition in consol energy now owns approximately  miles of gas gathering pipelines as well as  horsepower of compression  of which  approximately is wholly owned with the balance being leased 
along with this compression capacity  consol energy owns and operates a number of gas processing facilities 
this infrastructure is capable of delivering billion cubic feet per year of pipeline quality gas 
this in place gas infrastructure was primarily built to transport consol energy s coalbed methane cbm production and shallow conventional gas 
this system is generally not suited to move the higher pressure volumes associated with marcellus wells 
however  we believe that the network of right of ways  vast surface holdings and experience in building and operating gathering systems in the appalachian basin will give consol energy a tremendous advantage in building the midstream assets required to develop consol energy s marcellus position 
consol energy has had the advantage of having gas production from cbm  which can be lower btu than pipeline specification  as well as higher btu marcellus production which can complement each other by reducing and in some cases eliminating the need for costly processing of the cbm 
in addition  the lower btu cbm production offers an opportunity to blend ethane back into the gas stream when pricing or capacity for ethane markets dictate 
this will allow consol energy more flexibility in bringing marcellus on line at qualities that meet interstate pipeline specifications 
in addition to the pipeline and processing assets  consol energy has access to water resources 
through legacy mining operations overlapping the footprint of our gas resources  consol energy has access to mine waters and the infrastructure to move water to locations where water is needed to support future gas operations 
we believe that there are synergies between mining and gas operations around water resources that could give unique advantages to consol energy 
competition the united states natural gas industry is highly competitive 
consol energy competes with other large producers  thousands of small producers as well as pipeline imports from canada and liquefied natural gas 
table of contents lng from around the globe 
according to data from the natural gas supply association and the us department of energy  the five largest producers of natural gas produced less than of the total us production in the first half of the us department of energy reported almost  producing natural gas wells in the united states in  the latest year for which government statistics are available 
consol energy s gas operations are primarily in the eastern united states 
we believe that the gas market is highly fragmented and not dominated by any single producer 
we believe that several of our competitors have devoted far greater resources than we have to gas exploration and development 
we believe that competition within our market is based primarily on gas commodity trading fundamentals and pipeline transportation availability to the various markets 
continued demand for consol energy s natural gas and the prices that consol energy obtains are affected by demand for electricity  environmental and government regulation  technological developments and the availability and price of competing alternative fuel supplies 
power generation through a joint venture with allegheny energy supply company  llc  an affiliate of one of our largest coal customers  consol energy owns a interest in an megawatt  gas fired electric generating facility 
this facility is used for meeting peak load demands for electricity 
the facility is located in southwest virginia and uses coalbed methane gas that we produce 
because it is a peaking power facility  it does not operate at all times of the year  but the facility does provide a potential sales outlet for our gas of up to million cubic feet per day 
other operations consol energy provides other services both to our own operations and to others 
these include land services  industrial supply services  terminal services including break bulk  general cargo and warehouse services and river and dock services 
land resources consol energy is developing property assets previously used to support our coal operations or property assets currently not utilized 
consol energy expects to increase the value of our property assets by developing surface properties for commercial uses other than coal mining or gas development when the location of the property is suitable  deriving value from surface properties and right of ways in the development of gathering pipelines built for consol energy or for third parties  deriving royalty income from coal  oil and gas reserves consol energy owns but does not intend to develop  deriving income from the sustainable harvesting of timber on land consol energy owns  and deriving income from the rental of surface property for agricultural and non agricultural uses 
consol energy s objective is to improve the return on these assets without detracting from our core businesses and without significant additional capital investment

laws and regulations the mining and gas industries are subject to regulation by federal  state and local authorities on matters such as the discharge of materials into the environment  permitting and other licensing requirements  reclamation and restoration of properties after mining or gas operations are completed  management of materials generated by mining and gas operations  surface subsidence from underground mining  water discharge effluent limits  water appropriation  air quality standards  protection of wetlands  endangered plant and wildlife protection  limitations 
table of contents on land use  storage of petroleum products and substances that are regarded as hazardous under applicable laws  management of electrical equipment containing polychlorinated biphenyls pcbs  legislatively mandated benefits for current and retired coal miners  and employee health and safety 
in addition  the electric power generation industry is subject to extensive regulation regarding the environmental impact of its power generation activities  which could affect demand for consol energy s coal and gas products 
the possibility exists that new legislation or regulations may be adopted which would have a significant impact on consol energy s mining or gas operations or our customers ability to use coal or gas and may require consol energy or our customers to change their operations significantly or incur substantial costs 
numerous governmental permits and approvals are required for mining and gas operations 
regulations provide that a mining permit or modification can be delayed  refused or revoked if an officer  director or a stockholder with a or greater interest in the entity is affiliated with or is in a position to control another entity that has outstanding permit violations 
thus  all mining operations of consol energy entities must be maintained in compliance to avoid delay in issuance of necessary mining permits 
consol energy is  or may be  required to prepare and present to federal  state or local authorities data and or analyses pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal or gas may have upon the environment  the public and employee health and safety 
all requirements imposed by such authorities may be costly and time consuming and may delay commencement or continuation of exploration or production operations 
accordingly  the permits we need for our mining and gas operations may not be issued  or  if issued  may not be issued in a timely fashion 
permits we need may involve requirements that may be changed or interpreted in a manner which restricts our ability to conduct our mining and gas operations or to do so profitably 
future legislation and administrative regulations may increasingly emphasize the protection of the environment and employee health and safety 
as a consequence  the activities of consol energy may be more closely regulated 
such legislation and regulations  as well as future interpretations of existing laws  may require substantial increases in equipment and operating costs to consol energy and delays  interruptions or a termination of operations  the extent of which cannot be predicted 
while it is not possible to quantify the expenditures we incur to maintain compliance with all applicable federal and state laws  those costs have been and are expected to continue to be significant 
compliance with these laws has substantially increased the cost of mining and gas production for all domestic coal and gas producers 
we post surety performance bonds or letters of credit pursuant to federal and state mining laws and regulations for the estimated costs of reclamation and mine closing  often including the cost of treating mine water discharge when necessary 
we also post performance bonds or letters of credit pursuant to state oil and gas laws and regulations to guarantee reclamation of gas well sites and plugging of gas wells 
we endeavor to conduct our mining and gas operations in compliance with all applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations 
however  because of extensive and comprehensive regulatory requirements  violations during mining and gas operations occur from time to time 
consol energy made capital expenditures for environmental control facilities of approximately million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
the capital expenditures for environmental control facilities increased in primarily due to starting construction of an advanced water processing system at the buchanan mine 
construction of this facility was completed in consol energy expects to have capital expenditures of million in for environmental control facilities 
mine health and safety laws legislative and regulatory changes have required us to purchase additional safety equipment  construct stronger seals to isolate mined out areas  and engage in additional training 
we have also experienced more aggressive inspection protocols resulting in the issuance of more citations and with new regulations the amount of civil penalties have increased 
the actions taken thus far by federal and state governments include requiring the caching of additional supplies of self contained self rescuer scsr devices underground  
table of contents the purchase and installation of electronic communication and personal tracking devices underground  the placement of refuge chambers  which are structures designed to provide refuge for groups of miners during a mine emergency when evacuation from the mine is not possible  which will provide breathable air for hours  the replacement of existing seals in worked out areas of mines with stronger seals  the purchase of new fire resistant conveyor belting underground  additional training and testing that creates the need to hire additional employees  and more stringent rock dusting requirements 
in addition  on october   the mine safety and health administration msha published a proposed rule to reduce the permissible concentration of respirable dust in underground coal mines from the current standard of milligram per cubic meter of air to one milligram per cubic meter 
msha is also likely to adopt new safety standards for proximity protection for miners that will require certain underground mining equipment to be equipped with devices that will shut the equipment down if a person is too close to the equipment to avoid injuries where individuals are caught between equipment and blocks of unmined coal 
occupational safety and health act our gas operations are subject to regulation under the federal occupational safety and health act osha and comparable state laws in some states  all of which regulate health and safety of employees at our gas operations 
also  osha s hazardous communication standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced by our gas operations and that this information be provided to employees  state and local governments and the public 
black lung legislation under federal black lung benefits legislation  each coal mine operator is required to make payments of black lung benefits or contributions to current and former coal miners totally disabled from black lung disease  certain survivors of a miner who dies from black lung disease or pneumoconiosis  and a trust fund for the payment of benefits and medical expenses to claimants whose last mine employment was before january   where no responsible coal mine operator has been identified for claims where a miner s last coal employment was after december   or where the responsible coal mine operator has defaulted on the payment of such benefits 
the trust fund is funded by an excise tax on us production of up to per ton for deep mined coal and up to per ton for surface mined coal  neither amount to exceed of the gross sales price 
the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca  which was implemented in  made two changes to the federal black lung benefits act 
first  it provided changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims by creating a legal presumption that miners are entitled to benefits if they have worked at least years in coal mines and suffer from totally disabling lung disease 
a coal company would have to prove that a miner did not have black lung or that the disease was not caused by the miner s work 
second  it changed the law so black lung benefits being received by miners automatically go to their dependent survivors  regardless of the cause of the miner s death 
the impact of these law changes increased consol energy s pneumoconiosis liability by approximately million during the year ended december  in addition to the federal legislation  we are also liable under various state statutes for black lung claims 

table of contents retiree health benefits legislation the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the act established the combined benefit fund the combined fund 
the combined fund provides medical and death benefits for all beneficiaries including orphan retirees of the former united mine workers of america umwa benefit trusts who were actually receiving benefits as of july  the act also created a second benefit fund for umwa retirees  the benefit plan 
the benefit plan principally provides medical and death benefits to orphan umwa represented members eligible for retirement on february   and who actually retired between july  and september  the act provides for the assignment of beneficiaries to former signatory employers or related companies and the allocation of responsibility for unassigned beneficiaries referred to as orphans to the assigned operators 
the task of calculating the annual per beneficiary premium that assigned operators are obligated to pay to the combined fund is the responsibility of the commissioner of social security 
the umwa benefit plan is a defined contribution plan that was created as the result of negotiations for the national bituminous coal wage agreement nbcwa of this plan provides health care benefits to orphan umwa retirees who are not eligible to participate in the combined fund  the benefit fund  or whose last employer signed the nbcwa or a later nbcwa  and who subsequently goes out of business 
the act requires some of our signatory subsidiaries to make premium payments to the combined fund and to the benefit plan for the cost of our retirees and orphan retirees in those plans 
in addition  the nbcwa of requires our signatory subsidiaries to make specified payments to the benefit plan through the tax relief and health care act of the act provides additional federal funding for these orphan costs by authorizing general fund revenues and expanding transfers of interest from the abandoned mine land aml trust fund 
the additional federal funding  depending upon its magnitude and the amount of orphan benefits payable  should cover the orphan premium payments due under the combined fund as well as  after a phase in period  the orphan premium payments due under the benefit plan 
federal contributions were in federal contributions are expected to be after in addition  federal contributions are also to be phased in over the same period with respect to the costs for those orphan retirees as of december  under the benefit plan 
under the act  these general fund contributions to the combined fund  the benefit plan and the benefit plan and certain aml payments to the states and indian tribes are collectively limited by an aggregate annual cap of million 
these federal contributions do not apply to our subsidiaries assigned retired miners  and therefore our subsidiaries will continue to make premium payments for our assigned retired miners who receive benefits from the combined fund  the benefit plan and for certain beneficiaries of the benefit plan 
in addition  our subsidiaries remain responsible for making orphan premium payments to the combined fund and benefit plan to the extent that the federal contributions are not sufficient to cover the benefits 
pension protection act the pension protection act of the pension act has simplified and transformed rules governing the funding of defined benefit plans  accelerated funding obligations of employers  made permanent certain provisions of the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of egtrra  made permanent the diversification rights and investment education provisions for plan participants and encourages automatic enrollment in defined contribution k plans 
in general  most provisions of the pension act of are in effect for plan years beginning on or after december  plans generally are required to set a funding target of of the present value of accrued benefits and sponsors are required to amortize unfunded liabilities over a seven year period 
the pension act includes a funding target phase in provision consisting of a funding target in and thereafter 
plans with a funded ratio of less than  or less than using special assumptions  will be deemed to be at risk and will be subject to additional funding requirements 
the plan year funding ratio was 
the funding ratio is subject to year over year volatility and internal revenue service s calculation guidelines 

table of contents environmental laws consol energy is subject to various federal environmental laws  including the surface mining control and reclamation act of  the clean air act  the clean water act  the endangered species act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  the toxic substances control act  and the emergency planning and community right to know act  as administered and enforced by united states environmental protection agency epa and or authorized federal or state agencies  as well as state laws of similar scope  and other state environmental and conservation laws in each state in which consol energy operates 
these environmental laws require reporting  permitting and or approval of many aspects of coal mining and gas operations 
both federal and state inspectors regularly visit mines and other facilities to ensure compliance 
consol energy has ongoing compliance and permitting programs designed to ensure compliance with such environmental laws 
given the retroactive nature of certain environmental laws  consol energy has incurred  and may in the future incur liabilities in connection with properties and facilities currently or previously owned or operated 
liabilities above may be increased for sites to which consol energy or our subsidiaries sent waste materials 
surface mining control and reclamation act the surface mining control and reclamation act smcra establishes minimum national operational  reclamation and closure standards for all surface mines as well as most aspects of deep mines 
smcra requires that comprehensive environmental protection and reclamation standards be met during the course of and following completion of mining activities 
permits for all mining operations must be obtained from the federal office of surface mining reclamation and enforcement osm or  where state regulatory agencies have adopted federally approved state programs under smcra  the appropriate state regulatory authority 
states that operate federally approved state programs may impose standards which are more stringent than the requirements of smcra and osm s regulations and in many instances have done so 
all states in which consol energy s active mining operations are located have achieved primary jurisdiction for enforcement of smcra through approved state programs 
smcra permit provisions include requirements for coal exploration  baseline environmental data collection and analysis  mine plan development  topsoil removal  storage and replacement  selective handling of overburden materials  mine pit backfilling and grading  protection of the hydrologic balance  subsidence control for underground mines  refuse disposal plans  surface drainage control  mine drainage and mine discharge control and treatment  and site reclamation 
once a permit application is prepared and submitted to the regulatory agency  it goes through an administrative completeness review and a separate technical review 
public notice of the proposed permit application is given in a local newspaper followed by a public comment period before a permit can be issued 
some mining permits take over a year to prepare  depending on the size and complexity of the mine and can take six months to three years to be issued 
regulatory authorities have considerable discretion in the timing of the permit issuance 
the public has the right to comment on and otherwise participate in the permitting process  including through administrative appeals of permits and possibly further appeals in the 
table of contents courts 
the mine operator must submit a bond or otherwise secure the performance of reclamation obligations  including  as deemed appropriate by the regulatory authority  a bond sufficient to cover the costs of long term treatment of mine drainage discharges from closed facilities or ones from which a post mining discharge is anticipated 
the earliest a reclamation bond can be fully released is five years after reclamation has been completed  however  partial releases may be obtained as certain stages of reclamation are completed 
all states impose on mine operators the responsibility for repairing or compensating for damage occurring on the surface as a result of mine subsidence  a possible consequence of longwall or other methods of underground mining 
all states also impose an obligation on surface mining operations to replace domestic  agricultural or industrial water supplies adversely affected by such operations 
in addition  smcra imposes a reclamation fee on all current mining operations  the proceeds of which are deposited in the abandoned mine reclamation fund aml fund  which is used to restore unreclaimed and abandoned mine lands mined before the current per ton fee is per ton for surface mined coal and per ton for underground mined coal 
from october  through september   the fees will be per ton for surface mined coal and per ton for underground mined coal 
in pennsylvania  where consol energy operates three longwall mines  approximately million and million of expenses were incurred during the years ended december  and  respectively  to mitigate and repair impacts on streams from subsidence 
with respect to subsidence impacts to streams  the regulatory requirement to minimize impacts to the hydrologic balance could cause consol energy to change mine plans  to incur significant costs  and potentially even shut down mines in order to meet compliance requirements 
we currently estimate expenses related to subsidence of streams in pennsylvania will be approximately million for the year ended december  clean air act and related regulations the federal clean air act and similar state laws and regulations which regulate emissions into the air  affect coal mining  coal handling and processing  and gas processing operations primarily through permitting and or emissions control requirements 
for example  regulations relating to fugitive dust and coal combustion emissions could restrict consol energy s ability to develop new mines or require consol energy to modify our operations 
national ambient air quality standards naaqs for particulate matter resulted in some areas of the country being classified as non attainment for fine particulate matter 
because thermal dryers located at coal preparation plants burn coal and emit particulate matter  consol energy s mining operations are likely to be directly affected where the naaqs are implemented by the states 
the clean air act also indirectly affects coal mining operations by extensively regulating the air emissions of the coal fired electric power generating plants operated by our customers 
coal contains impurities  such as sulfur  mercury and other constituents  many of which are released into the air when coal is burned 
carbon dioxide  a greenhouse gas  is also emitted when coal is burned 
environmental regulations governing emissions from coal fired electric generating plants could affect demand for coal as a fuel source and affect the volume of our sales 
for example  the federal clean air act places limits on sulfur dioxide  nitrogen dioxide  and mercury emissions from electric power plants 
in october  the epa finalized a rule requiring a number of eastern us states to make substantial reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions by june  the nox sip call 
further sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission reductions were adopted by regulations called the clean air interstate rules cair  which were promulgated by the epa in in july and december  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia remanded the cair regulations to the epa but did not vacate the regulations 
the regulations were not vacated because many states were already implementing them and some coal fired electric generating facilities were being equipped with scrubbers in order to comply with the cair requirements 
in august  the epa published in the federal register the proposed clean air transport rule the transport rule 
the transport rule is intended to replace cair 
the transport rule will allow minimal or no interstate trading 
this will likely make compliance more expensive 
the epa s schedule is to finalize the transport rule by july the first phase of the transport rule emission reductions will go into effect in 
table of contents the installation of additional control measures to achieve regulatory emission reductions makes it more costly to operate coal fired power plants and could make coal a less attractive fuel 
in order to meet the proposed new limits for sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants  many coal users need to install scrubbers  use sulfur dioxide emission allowances some of which they may purchase  blend high sulfur coal with low sulfur coal or switch to low sulfur coal or other fuels 
more strict emission limits mean few coals can be burned without the installation of supplemental environmental control technology in the form of scrubbers 
many of our customers are in the process of installing scrubbers in response to the cair emissions requirements 
we estimate that by  more than half of the installed  coal fired power plant capacity east of the mississippi will be scrubbed 
the increase in scrubbed capacity allows customers to consider purchasing more of our higher sulfur coals 
in  the epa finalized the clean air mercury rule camr which imposed caps on mercury emissions from coal fired electric generating units 
the first phase of the emission caps would have taken effect in in february  the us court of appeals for the us circuit vacated the camr 
epa is developing emission limits for mercury for coal fired electric generating facilities under section of the clean air act  which requires the epa to impose maximum achievable control technology mact limits 
the epa intends to issue proposed mact regulations for mercury in march and to issue final mact regulations in november various states have promulgated or are considering more stringent emission limits on mercury emissions from coal fired electric generating units 
regulation of mercury emissions from coal fired electric generating units could impact the market for coal 
a regional haze program initiated by the epa to protect and to improve visibility at and around national parks  national wilderness areas and international parks may restrict the construction of new coal fired power plants whose operation may impair visibility at and around federally protected areas and may require some existing coal fired power plants to install additional control measures designed to limit haze causing emissions 
these requirements could limit the demand for coal in some locations 
the clean air act and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from compressor stations used in our gas operations 
we may also be required to obtain pre approval for construction or modification of certain facilities  to meet stringent air permit requirements  or to use specific equipment  technologies or best management practices to control emissions 
also  numerous proposals have been made at the international  national  regional and state levels that are intended to limit or capture emissions of greenhouse gases  such as carbon dioxide and methane  and several states have adopted measures intended to reduce greenhouse gas loading in the atmosphere 
burning of coal and natural gas produce carbon dioxide 
also  natural gas and coalbed gas contain methane 
if comprehensive legislation focusing on greenhouse gas ghg emissions is enacted by the united states or individual states  it may adversely affect the use of and demand for fossil fuels  particularly coal  as an energy source for electricity generation 
in  the us supreme court held in massachusetts v 
environmental protection agency epa  that the epa had authority to regulate ghgs under the clean air act and a number of states have filed lawsuits seeking to force the epa to adopt ghg regulations 
in december  the epa made a determination that ghgs cause or contribute to air pollution and may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare  which findings are prerequisites to the epa regulating ghgs under the clean air act 
although  efforts to enact greenhouse gas legislation have failed  the epa is proceeding with greenhouse gas regulations 
in september  the epa finalized the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas rule 
the current version of this rule requires reporting of emissions from coal mines and gas wells and associated facilities for emissions 
in december  the epa announced a proposed schedule for establishing greenhouse gas emission limits for fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities proposed regulations by july and final regulations by may such regulations could significantly increase the cost of generation of electricity at coal fired facilities and could make competing forms of electricity generation more competitive 

table of contents clean water act the federal clean water act and corresponding state laws affect coal and gas operations by imposing restrictions on discharges into regulated surface waters 
permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters 
the clean water act and corresponding state laws include requirements for improvement of designated impaired waters not meeting state water quality standards through the use of effluent limitations established so that all discharges to the impaired stream do not exceed total maximum daily load tmdl levels of the pollutants causing the impairment  anti degradation regulations which protect state designated high quality exceptional use streams by restricting or prohibiting discharges which result in degradation  requirements to treat discharges from coal mining properties for non traditional pollutants  such as chlorides  selenium and dissolved solids  and protecting streams  wetlands  other regulated water sources and associated riparian lands from surface mining and or the surface impacts of underground mining  and the requirements to obtain permits for the discharge of produced wastes and other oil and gas wastes  or to dispose of such substances at approved disposal facilities 
these requirements may cause consol energy to incur significant additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
permits for discharges of fill material into streams in connection with mining operations are issued by the army corps of engineers the coe 
the coe is empowered to issue nationwide permits for specific categories of filing activity that are determined to have minimal environmental adverse effects in order to save the cost and time of issuing individual permits under section of the clean water act 
individual permits are required for activities determined to have more significant impacts to the waters of the united states 
since  environmental groups have pursued litigation primarily in west virginia and kentucky challenging the validity of nationwide permit and various individual permits authorizing valley fills associated with surface coal mining operations primarily mountain top removal operations 
this litigation has resulted in delays in obtaining these permits and has increased permitting costs 
the most recent major decision in this line of litigation is the opinion of the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit in ohio valley environmental council v 
aracoma coal company  f 
d aracoma  issued on february  aracoma appeared to be a major victory for the coal industry because the court rejected all of the substantive challenges to the section permits involved in the case primarily by deferring to the expertise of the coe in review of the permit applications 
the effect of the aracoma decision was quickly nullified by several epa initiatives relating to section permits and other permits and approvals required for coal mining operations 
first  in early  the epa began to comment on section permit applications pending before the coe raising many of the same issues decided in favor of the coal industry in aracoma 
many of the epa s comment letters were submitted long after the end of the epa s comment period based on what the epa contended was new information on the impacts of valley fills on stream water quality immediately downstream of valley fills 
however  the comment letters addressed many issues beyond the new information on alleged water quality impacts  such as  minimization of the size and number of valley fills  cumulative impacts of the operation on the watershed  and the types and extent of mitigation 
these comment letters practically resulted in a moratorium on the issuance of section permits for valley fills for coal surface mines 
a second initiative of the epa is enhanced review of any permit for a coal mining activity that requires both a smcra permit and a section permit in the states of kentucky  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  virginia and west virginia designated as appalachian surface coal mining 
this initiative resulted in a joint memorandum of understanding mou among the coe  the epa and the department of interior osm 
the enhanced review under the mou has continued the delay in coe action on pending section permit applications 
a third initiative is to take a more active role in its review of npdes permit applications for coal mining operations 
a fourth initiative is epa guidance to the states that instream specific conductance levels exceeding microsiemens per centimeter is presumptive evidence that state narrative water quality standards which generally prohibit discharges harmful to aquatic life would be violated requiring the states to establish permit effluent limits to maintain instream specific conductance below microsiemens per centimeter 
additionally  epa s initiatives are being supported by environmental groups 
two citizen groups recently filed a clean water act citizen suit against a consol energy subsidiary alleging that discharges from a surface mine in west virginia violate state water quality 
table of contents standards in part because the specific conductance in the receiving stream exceeds the epa benchmark of microsiemens per centimeter 
all of these initiatives have resulted in delays in the review and issuance of permits for surface coal mining operations  including applications for surface facilities for underground mines  such as applications for coal refuse disposal areas 
so far  consol energy subsidiaries have been able to continue operating their existing mines 
also  in one subsidiary was able to obtain a section permit for a new surface mine in southern west virginia 
however  the new permit contains epa mandated environmental protection conditions 
the epa s enhanced scrutiny initiatives have been challenged by the national mining association nma 
on january   the u 
s 
district court for the district of columbia denied the epa s motion to dismiss the nma s complaint and also denied the nma s motion for a preliminary injunction of the epa s enhanced scrutiny initiatives 
although the nma s motion for a preliminary injunction was denied  the opinion contains holdings suggesting that the court may rule in favor of the nma on the merits of the case 
unless the nma is successful in its challenge of the epa s enhanced scrutiny of permit applications  we anticipate that it will continue to take longer to obtain permits and the costs of obtaining permits and compliance with permit conditions will increase significantly 
these requirements may cause consol energy to incur additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows 
in december  the pennsylvania department of environmental protection designated portions of the monongahela river as impaired not meeting state water quality standards for sulfates in pennsylvania s biennial integrated water quality monitoring and assessment report to the epa 
the clean water act and corresponding state laws include requirements for improvement of designated impaired waters not meeting state water quality standards through the use of effluent limitations established so that all discharge to the impaired stream do not exceed the total maximum daily load tmdl levels of the pollutants causing the impairment 
a tmdl accounts for existing loading of the pollutant sulfates in this case and sets a cumulative pollution load for the stream so as to prevent violations of state water quality standards 
tmdl s are used to set best management practices and set permit discharge limits 
tmdl based discharge limits are frequently more stringent than existing permit limits or often result in limits for pollutants that were not previously regulated 
consol energy has one active underground mine and several closed mines in pennsylvania that discharge into the monongahela river 
all of these operations could be subject to new effluent limits for sulfates that may result in the need to construct and operate expensive advanced water treatment facilities 
the epa has announced that it will conduct a comprehensive study of the potential adverse impact that hydraulic fracturing may have on water quality and public health 
hydraulic fracturing is a way of producing gas from tight rock formations such as the barnett and marcellus shales 
the epa plans to initiate the study in january and have the initial study results available by late it is too early to predict what actions  if any  will result from the study 
endangered species act the federal endangered species act esa and similar state laws protect species threatened with extinction 
protection of endangered species may affect our ability to obtain permits for mining and gas operations  may delay issuance of mining permits  or may cause us to modify mining plans or develop and implement species specific protection and enhancement plans to avoid or minimize impacts to endangered species or their habitats 
a number of species indigenous to the areas where we operate are protected under the esa 
based on the species that have been identified and the current application of applicable laws and regulations  we do not believe that there are any species protected under the esa or state laws that would materially and adversely affect our ability to mine coal or produce gas from our properties 
comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act superfund and similar state laws create liabilities for the investigation and remediation of releases of hazardous substances into the environment and for damages to natural resources 
we could incur liability under cercla relative to our coal 
table of contents or gas operations 
our current and former coal mining operations incur  and will continue to incur  expenditures associated with the investigation and remediation of facilities and environmental conditions  including underground storage tanks  solid and hazardous waste disposal and other matters under superfund and similar state environmental laws 
we also must comply with reporting requirements under the emergency planning and community right to know act and the toxic substances control act 
from time to time  we have been the subject of administrative proceedings  litigation and investigations relating to sites that have released hazardous substances 
we have been in the past and currently are named as a potentially responsible party at superfund sites 
we may become involved in future proceedings  litigation or investigations and incur liabilities that could be materially adverse to us 
resource conservation and recovery act the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and corresponding state laws and regulations affect coal mining and gas operations by imposing requirements for the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous wastes 
facilities at which hazardous wastes have been treated  stored or disposed are subject to corrective action orders issued by the epa which could adversely affect our results  financial condition and cash flows 
rcra exempted fossil fuel combustion wastes coal combustion wastes from hazardous waste regulation until the epa completed a report to congress and made a determination on whether the wastes should be regulated as hazardous waste 
in may  the epa concluded that coal combustion wastes do not warrant regulation as hazardous under rcra resulting in coal combustion wastes remaining exempt from hazardous waste regulation 
however  the epa determined that national non hazardous waste regulations under rcra are needed for coal combustion wastes disposed in surface impoundments and landfills and used as mine fill  and the office of surface mining is currently developing these regulations 
the agency also concluded that beneficial uses of these wastes  other than for mine filling  pose no significant risk and no additional national regulations are needed 
most state hazardous waste laws also exempt coal combustion waste  and instead treat it as either a solid waste or a special waste 
in response to the tennessee valley authority coal ash spill in december  the epa initiated a fast track regulatory process in which it is considering three possible regulatory scenarios for coal combustion wastes regulation as a non hazardous waste under subtitle d of rcra  regulation as a hazardous waste under subtitle c  or a hybrid subtitle c d approach 
the proposed coal combustion residuals rule was published in june the public comment period ended on november  industry and state regulatory agencies are trying to convince the epa that the states are adequately regulating the handling and disposal of coal combustion wastes 
the loss of the hazardous waste exemption for coal combustion waste  or the adoption of new regulations for disposing of coal combustion waste which impose significant additional costs  could adversely affect the demand for coal for electricity generation 
federal coal leasing amendments act mining operations on federal lands in the western united states are affected by regulations of the united states department of the interior 
the federal coal leasing amendments act of amended the mineral lands leasing act of which authorized the leasing of federal coal lands for coal mining 
the federal coal leasing amendments act increased the royalties payable to the united states government for federal coal leases and required diligent development and continuous operations of leased reserves within a specified period of time 
subtitle d of the energy policy act of pub 
l 
contained the coal leasing amendments act of  which includes provisions designed to facilitate efficient and economic development of federal coal leases 
the united states department of the interior has stated that it intends to promulgate new regulations and implement these amendments 
regulations adopted by the united states department of the interior to implement such legislation could affect coal mining by consol energy from federal coal leases 

table of contents federal regulation of the sale and transportation of gas various aspects of our gas operations are regulated by agencies of the federal government 
the federal energy regulatory commission regulates the transportation and sale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the natural gas act of and the natural gas policy act of while first sales by producers of natural gas  and all sales of condensate and natural gas liquids can be made currently at uncontrolled market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
in  congress enacted the natural gas wellhead decontrol act  which removed all natural gas act and natural gas policy act price and non price controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  regulations and orders set forth by the federal energy regulatory commission also impact our gas business to a certain degree 
although the federal energy regulatory commission does not directly regulate our gas production activities  the federal energy regulatory commission has stated that it intends for certain of its orders to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
additionally  the federal energy regulatory commission continues to review its transportation regulations  including whether to allocate all short term capacity on the basis of competitive auctions and whether changes to its long term transportation policies may also be appropriate to avoid a market bias toward short term contracts 
additional federal energy regulatory commission orders have been adopted based on this review with the goal of increasing competition for natural gas markets and transportation 
the federal energy regulatory commission has also issued numerous orders confirming the sale and abandonment of natural gas gathering facilities previously owned by interstate pipelines and acknowledging that if the federal energy regulatory commission does not have jurisdiction over services provided by these facilities  then such facilities and services may be subject to regulation by state authorities in accordance with state law 
in addition  the federal energy regulatory commission s approval of transfers of previously regulated gathering systems to independent or pipeline affiliated gathering companies that are not subject to federal energy regulatory commission regulation may affect competition for gathering or natural gas marketing services in areas served by those systems and thus may affect both the costs and the nature of gathering services that will be available to interested producers or shippers in the future 
we own certain natural gas pipeline facilities that we believe meet the traditional tests which the federal energy regulatory commission has used to establish a pipeline s status as a gatherer not subject to the federal energy regulatory commission jurisdiction 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the gas industry may be pending before congress  the federal energy regulatory commission  the minerals management service  state commissions and the courts 
we cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective 
in the past  the natural gas industry has been heavily regulated 
there is no assurance that the regulatory approach currently pursued by various agencies will continue indefinitely 
notwithstanding the foregoing  we do not anticipate that compliance with existing federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations will have a significantly adverse effect upon the capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position of consol energy or its subsidiaries 
no material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the federal government 
state regulation of gas operations our gas operations are also subject to regulation at the state and in some cases  county  municipal and local governmental levels 
such regulation includes requiring permits for the drilling of wells  maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells  regulating the location of wells  the method of drilling and casing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  the disposal of fluids used in connection with operations  and gas operations producing coalbed methane in relation to active mining 
our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations 
these 
table of contents include regulations that affect the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units  the density of wells which may be drilled and the unitization or pooling of gas properties 
in addition  state conservation laws establish maximum rates of production from gas wells  generally prohibit the venting or flaring of gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production 
a number of states have either enacted new laws or may be considering the adequacy of existing laws affecting gathering rates and or services 
other state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety  environmental and in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements  but does not generally entail rate regulation 
thus  natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny of state agencies in the future 
our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to increased state regulation of rates or services  although we do not believe that they would be affected by such regulation any differently than other natural gas producers or gatherers 
however  these regulatory burdens may affect profitability  and we are unable to predict the future cost or impact of complying with such regulations 
ownership of mineral rights consol energy s past practice has been to acquire ownership or leasehold rights to our coal properties prior to conducting our coal mining operations 
given consol energy s long history as a coal producer we believe we have a well developed ownership position relating to our coal holdings 
although consol energy generally attempts to obtain ownership or leasehold rights to cbm and or conventional gas related to our coal holdings  our ownership position relating to these property estates is less developed 
as is customary in the coal and gas industry  a summary review of the title to coal  cbm and other gas rights is made on properties at the time of the acquisition of the other rights in the properties 
prior to the commencement of gas drilling operations on those properties  we conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects 
to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties  we are typically responsible for curing any title defects 
we generally will not commence our drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property 
we completed title work on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the gas industry 
the following summary sets forth an analysis of provisions of pennsylvania  virginia and west virginia law relating to the ownership of cbm 
these summaries do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the provisions of applicable law and rights and the laws relating to traditional natural gas resources may differ materially from the rights related to cbm 
these summaries are based on current law as of the date of this annual report on form k 
pennsylvania in pennsylvania  cbm that remains inside the coal seam is generally the property of the owner of that coal seam where the gas is located 
cbm can be sold in place or leased by the coal owner to another party such as a producer who then would have the right to extract the gas from the coal seam under the terms of the agreement with the coal owner 
once the gas migrates from the coal into other strata  the coal owner no longer has clear title to that migrated gas 
as a result  in certain circumstances in pennsylvania eg  in a gob or mine void  we may be required to obtain other property interests beyond ownership or leasehold interest in the coal rights or cbm in order to extract gas that is no longer located in the coal seam 
virginia the virginia supreme court has stated that the grant of coal rights only does not include rights to cbm absent an express grant of cbm  natural gases  or minerals in general 
the situation may be different if there is any expression in the severance deed indicating more than mere coal is conveyed 
virginia courts have also found that the owner of the cbm did not have the right to fracture the coal in order to retrieve the cbm and that the coal operator had the right to ventilate the cbm in the course of mining 
in virginia  we believe that we control the relevant property rights in order to capture gas from the vast majority of our producing properties 

table of contents in addition  virginia has established the virginia gas and oil board and a procedure for the development of cbm by an operator in those instances where the owner of the cbm has not leased it to the operator or in situations where there are conflicting claims of ownership of the cbm 
the general practice is to force pool both the coal owner and the gas owner 
in those instances  any royalties otherwise payable are paid into escrow and the burden then is upon the conflicting claimants to establish ownership by court action 
the virginia gas and oil board does not make ownership decisions 
west virginia the west virginia supreme court has held that in a conventional oil and gas lease executed prior to the inception of widespread public knowledge regarding cbm operations  the oil and gas lessee did not acquire the right to produce cbm 
as of december   the west virginia courts have not clarified who owns cbm in west virginia 
therefore  the ownership of cbm is an open question in west virginia 
west virginia has enacted a law  the coalbed methane wells and units act the west virginia act  regulating the commercial recovery and marketing of cbm 
although the west virginia act does not specify who owns  or has the right to exploit  cbm in west virginia and instead refers ownership disputes to judicial resolution  it contains provisions similar to virginia s pooling law 
under the pooling provisions of the west virginia act  an applicant who proposes to drill can prosecute an administrative proceeding with the west virginia coalbed methane review board to obtain authority to produce cbm from pooled acreage 
owners and claimants of cbm interests who have not consented to the drilling are afforded certain elective forms of participation in the drilling eg  royalty or owner  but their consent is not required to obtain a pooling order authorizing the production of cbm by the operator within the boundaries of the drilling unit 
the west virginia act also provides that  where title to subsurface minerals has been severed in such a way that title to coal and title to natural gas are vested in different persons  the operator of a cbm well permitted  drilled and completed under color of title to the cbm from either the coal seam owner or the natural gas owner has an affirmative defense to an action for willful trespass relating to the drilling and commercial production of cbm from that well 
we anticipate in future years to more actively explore for and develop northern appalachian cbm in west virginia 
as indicated  we may need or desire to acquire additional rights from other holders of real estate interests  including acquiring rights from other real estate interest holders if the law at that time continues to lack clarity on ownership rights to cbm in west virginia 
as we explore and develop this other acreage where we have coal rights  we expect  in accordance with our existing procedures  to have a title examination performed of the rights to cbm 
if we believe we need to obtain additional rights from the holders of other real estate interests  we have developed a methodology as part of deciding the feasibility of developing a particular tract to evaluate the ability to locate and negotiate a royalty arrangement with those other holders or use pooling provisions under the west virginia act 
other states we have rights to extract cbm where we have coal rights in other states 
the ownership of cbm in the illinois basin and certain other western basins may be uncertain or could belong to other holders of real estate interests and we may need to acquire additional rights from other holders of real estate interests to extract and produce cbm in these other states

risk factors 
investment in our securities is subject to various risks  including risks and uncertainties inherent in our business 
the following sets forth factors related to our business  operations  financial position or future financial performance or cash flows which could cause an investment in our securities to decline and result in a loss 
deterioration in the economic conditions in any of the industries in which our customers operate  or sustained uncertainty in financial markets  may have adverse impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict 
economic conditions in a number of industries in which our customers operate  such as electric power generation and steel making  substantially deteriorated in recent years and reduced the demand for natural gas and coal 
although global industrial activity recovered in from levels  the continuation of the recovery  especially for industries in the united states and europe  is uncertain 
during recent years  financial markets in the united states  europe and asia also experienced unprecedented turmoil and upheaval 
this was characterized by extreme volatility and declines in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  inability to access capital markets  the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government and other governments 
although we cannot predict the impacts  renewed weakness in the economic conditions of any of the industries we serve or in the financial markets could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
for example demand for natural gas and electricity in the united states is impacted by industrial production  which if weakened would negatively impact the revenues  margins and profitability of our natural gas and steam coal business  demand for metallurgical coal hinges on steel demand in the united states and globally  which if weakened would negatively impact the revenues  margins and profitability of our metallurgical coal business  the tightening of credit or lack of credit availability to our customers could adversely affect our ability to collect our trade receivables and the amount of receivables eligible for sale pursuant to our accounts receivable securitization facility may decline  our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to raise capital for our business including for exploration and or development of our coal or gas reserves  and our commodity hedging arrangements could become ineffective if our counterparties are unable to perform their obligations or seek bankruptcy protection 
a significant or extended decline in the prices consol energy receives for our coal and gas could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
our financial results are significantly affected by the prices we receive for our coal and gas 
extended or substantial price declines for coal would adversely affect our operating results for future periods and our ability to generate cash flows necessary to improve productivity and expand operations 
prices of coal may fluctuate due to factors beyond our control such as overall domestic and global economic conditions  the consumption pattern of industrial consumers  electricity generators and residential users  increased utilization by the steel industry of electric arc furnaces or pulverized coal processes to make steel which do not use furnace coke  an intermediate 
table of contents product produced from metallurgical coal  technological advances affecting energy consumption  domestic and foreign government regulations  price and availability of alternative fuels  price of foreign imports  and weather conditions 
any adverse change in these factors could result in weaker demand and possibly lower prices for our coal production  which would reduce our revenues 
gas prices are closely linked to supply of natural gas and consumption patterns in the united states of the electric power generation industry and certain industrial and residential patterns where gas is the principal fuel 
natural gas prices are very volatile  and even relatively modest drops in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede growth 
changes in natural gas prices have a significant impact on the value of our reserves and on our cash flow 
in the past we have used hedging transactions to reduce our exposure to market price volatility when we deemed it appropriate 
if we choose not to engage in  or reduce our use of hedging arrangements in the future  we may be more adversely affected by changes in natural gas prices than our competitors who engage in hedging arrangements to a greater extent than we do 
prices for natural gas may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  such as the domestic and foreign supply of natural gas  the price of foreign imports  overall domestic and global economic conditions  the consumption pattern of industrial consumers  electricity generators and residential users  weather conditions  technological advances affecting energy consumption  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  proximity and capacity of gas pipelines and other transportation facilities  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
many of these factors may be beyond our control 
in particular  while demand for natural gas recovered to pre recession levels  the us natural gas industry continues to face concerns of oversupply due to the success of new shale plays and continued drilling in these plays  despite lower gas prices  to meet drilling commitments 
lower natural gas prices may not only decrease our revenues on a per unit basis  but may also limit our access to capital 
a significant decrease in price levels for an extended period would negatively affect us in several ways 
these include reduced cash flow  which would decrease funds available for capital expenditures employed to replace reserves or increase production 
also  our access to other sources of capital  such as equity or long term debt markets  could be severely limited or unavailable 
additionally  lower natural gas prices may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically 
this may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
if this occurs  or if our estimates of development costs increase  production data factors change or our exploration results deteriorate  accounting rules may require us to write down  as a non cash charge to earnings  the carrying value of our natural gas properties 
we are required to perform impairment tests on our assets whenever events or changes in circumstances lead to a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows that would indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable or whenever management s plans change with respect to those assets 
we may incur impairment charges in the future  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period taken 
if coal customers do not extend existing contracts or do not enter into new long term coal contracts  profitability of consol energy s operations could be affected 
during the year ended december   approximately of the coal consol energy produced was sold under long term contracts contracts with terms of one year or more 
if a substantial portion of consol energy s long term contracts are modified or terminated or if force majeure is exercised  consol energy would be adversely affected if we are unable to replace the contracts or if new contracts are not at the same level of profitability 
if existing customers do not honor current contract commitments  our revenue would be adversely affected 
the profitability of our long term coal supply contracts depends on a variety of factors  which vary from contract to contract and fluctuate during the contract term  including our production costs and other factors 
price changes  if any  provided in long term supply contracts may not reflect our cost increases  and therefore  increases in our costs may reduce our profit margins 
in addition  in periods of declining market prices  provisions in our long term coal contracts for adjustment or renegotiation of prices and other provisions may increase our exposure to short term coal price volatility 
as a result  consol energy may not be able to obtain long term agreements at favorable prices compared to either market conditions  as they may change from time to time  or our cost structure and long term contracts may not contribute to our profitability 

table of contents the loss of  or significant reduction in  purchases by our largest customers could adversely affect our revenues 
for the year ended december   we derived over of our total revenues from sales to our four largest coal and gas customers 
at december   we had approximately coal supply agreements with these customers that expire at various times from to we are currently discussing the extension of existing agreements or entering into new long term agreements with some of these customers  but these negotiations may not be successful and these customers may not continue to purchase coal from us under long term coal supply agreements 
if any one of these four customers were to significantly reduce their purchases of coal from us  or if we were unable to sell coal to them on terms as favorable to us as the terms under our current agreements  our financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our ability to collect payments from our customers could be impaired if their creditworthiness declines or if they fail to honor their contracts with us 
our ability to receive payment for coal and gas sold and delivered depends on the continued creditworthiness of our customers 
some power plant owners may have credit ratings that are below investment grade 
if the creditworthiness of our customers declines significantly  our million accounts receivable securitization program and our business could be adversely affected 
in addition  if customers refuse to accept shipments of our coal for which they have an existing contractual obligation  our revenues will decrease and we may have to reduce production at our mines until our customer s contractual obligations are honored 
the availability and reliability of transportation facilities and fluctuations in transportation costs could affect the demand for our coal or impair our ability to supply coal to our customers 
similarly  our gas business depends on gathering  processing and transportation facilities owned by others and the disruption of  capacity constraints in  or proximity to pipeline systems could limit sales of our gas 
coal producers depend upon rail  barge  trucking  overland conveyor and other systems to provide access to markets 
disruption of transportation services because of weather related problems  strikes  lock outs  break downs of locks and dams or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply coal to customers and adversely affect our profitability 
transportation costs represent a significant portion of the delivered cost of coal and  as a result  the cost of delivery is a critical factor in a customer s purchasing decision 
increases in transportation costs could make our coal less competitive 
we gather  process and transport our gas to market by utilizing pipelines and facilities owned by others 
if pipelines and facilities do not exist near our producing wells  if pipeline or facility capacity is limited or if pipeline or facility capacity is unexpectedly disrupted  our gas sales could be limited  reducing our profitability 
if we cannot access processing pipeline transportation facilities  we may have to reduce our production of gas or vent our produced gas to the atmosphere because we do not have facilities to store excess inventory 
if our sales of gas are reduced because of transportation or processing constraints  our revenues will be reduced  and our unit costs will also increase 
if pipeline quality tariffs change  we might be required to install additional processing equipment which could increase our costs 
the pipeline could also curtail our flows until the gas delivered to their pipeline is in compliance 
competition within the coal and gas industries may adversely affect our ability to sell our products 
increased competition or a loss of our competitive position could adversely affect our sales of  or our prices for  our coal and gas products  which could impair our profitability 
consol energy competes with coal producers in various regions of the united states and with some foreign coal producers for domestic sales primarily to electric power generators 
consol energy also competes with both domestic and foreign coal producers for sales in international markets 
demand for our coal by our principal customers is affected by the delivered price of competing coals  other fuel supplies and alternative 
table of contents generating sources  including nuclear  natural gas  oil and renewable energy sources  such as hydroelectric and wind power 
consol energy sells coal to foreign electricity generators and to the more specialized metallurgical coal market  both of which are significantly affected by international demand and competition 
increases in coal prices could encourage existing producers to expand capacity or could encourage new producers to enter the market 
if overcapacity results  prices could fall or we may not be able to sell our coal  which would reduce revenue 
the gas industry is intensely competitive with companies from various regions of the united states 
we compete with these companies and we may compete with foreign companies for domestic sales 
many of the companies we compete with are larger and have greater financial  technological  human and other resources 
if we are unable to compete  our company  our operating results and financial position may be adversely affected 
in addition  larger companies may be able to pay more to acquire new gas properties for future exploration  limiting our ability to replace gas we produce or to grow our production 
our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover new gas resources also depends on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate these transactions in a highly competitive environment 
we could be negatively affected if we fail to negotiate a new agreement with the united mine workers of america  if we enter into a new agreement which significantly increases our labor costs or if we otherwise fail to maintain satisfactory labor relations 
as of december   we had  employees 
approximately of these employees are represented by the united mine workers of america umwa and union operations generated approximately of our us coal production during the year ended december  our current collective bargaining agreement with the umwa expires on december  if we do not negotiate a new collective bargaining agreement with the umwa  we may incur prolonged strikes and other work stoppages at our union mines 
we may also have significant reductions in productivity which can materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations by significantly reducing our production and sale of coal 
if we enter into a new agreement with the umwa which significantly increases our labor costs relative to other coal companies  our ability to compete with other coal companies may be materially adversely affected 
satisfactory relations with our employees and organized labor is important to our success 
if we do not maintain satisfactory labor relations  we may incur strikes  other work stoppages  or have reduced productivity 
the characteristics of coal may make it costly for electric power generators and other coal users to comply with various environmental standards regarding the emissions of impurities released when coal is burned which could cause utilities to replace coal fired power plants with alternative fuels 
in addition  various incentives have been proposed to encourage the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources 
a reduction in the use of coal for electric power generation could decrease the volume of our coal sales and adversely affect our results of operation 
coal contains impurities  including sulfur  mercury  chlorine and other elements or compounds  many of which are released into the air when coal is burned 
complying with regulations on the emissions of impurities can be costly for electric power generators 
for example  in order to meet the federal clean air act limits for sulfur dioxide emissions from electric power plants  coal users will need to install scrubbers  use sulfur dioxide emission allowances some of which they may purchase  or switch to other fuels 
each option has limitations 
lower sulfur coal may be more costly to purchase on an energy basis than higher sulfur coal depending on mining and transportation costs 
the cost of installing scrubbers is significant and emission allowances may become more expensive as their availability declines 
switching to other fuels may require expensive modification of existing plants 
because higher sulfur coal currently accounts for a significant portion of our sales  the extent to which electric power generators switch to alternative fuel could materially affect us 
proposed reductions in emissions of mercury  sulfur dioxides  nitrogen oxides  or particulate matter may require the installation of additional costly control technology or the implementation of other measures  including trading of 
table of contents emission allowances and switching to alternative fuels 
the environmental protection agency epa continues to require reduction of nitrogen oxide emissions in a number of eastern states and the district of columbia and will require reduction of particulate matter emissions over the next several years for areas that do not meet air quality standards for fine particulates 
additional reductions in permissible emission levels of impurities by coal fired plants will likely make it more costly to operate coal fired electric power plants and make coal a less attractive fuel alternative for electric power generation in the future 
apart from actual and potential regulation of emissions from coal fired plants  state and federal mandates for increased use of electricity from renewable energy sources could have an impact on the market for our coal 
several states have enacted legislative mandates requiring electricity suppliers to use renewable energy sources to generate a certain percentage of power 
there have been numerous proposals to establish a similar uniform  national standard although none of these proposals have been enacted to date 
possible advances in technologies and incentives  such as tax credits  to enhance the economics of renewable energy sources could make these sources more competitive with coal 
any reductions in the amount of coal consumed by domestic electric power generators as a result of current or new standards for the emission of impurities or incentives to switch to alternative fuels or renewable energy sources could reduce the demand for our coal  thereby reducing our revenues and adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
regulation of greenhouse gas emissions as well as uncertainty concerning such regulation could adversely impact the market for coal and natural gas and the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions may increase our operating costs and reduce the value of our coal and gas assets 
while climate change legislation in the us is unlikely in the next several years  the issue of global climate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention with widespread concern about the impacts of human activity  especially the emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs  such as carbon dioxide and methane 
combustion of fossil fuels  such as the coal and gas we produce  results in the creation of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere by coal and gas end users  such as coal fired electric power generation plants 
numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international  national  regional and state levels of government that are intended to limit emissions of ghgs 
several states have already adopted measures requiring reduction of ghgs within state boundaries 
internationally  the kyoto protocol  which set binding emission targets for developed countries including the united states but has not been ratified by the united states expires in and negotiations are underway for a new protocol 
regulation of ghgs could occur in the united states pursuant to epa regulation under the clean air act 
on december  the epa announced that it will propose standards for ghg emissions for power plants in july and issue final standards in may apart from governmental regulation  on february   three of wall street s largest investment banks announced that they had adopted climate change guidelines for lenders 
the guidelines require the evaluation of carbon risks in the financing of electric power generation plants which may make it more difficult for utilities to obtain financing for coal fired plants 
if comprehensive regulation focusing on ghgs emission reductions is adopted for the united states by the epa or in other countries where we sell coal  or if utilities were to have difficulty obtaining financing in connection with coal fired plants  it may make it more costly to operate fossil fuel fired especially coal fired electric power generation plants and make fossil fuels less attractive for electric utility power plants in the future 
depending on the nature of the regulation or legislation  natural gas fueled power generation could become more economically attractive than coal fueled power generation  substantially increasing the demand for natural gas 
apart from actual regulation  uncertainty over the regulation of ghg emissions may inhibit utilities from investing in the building of new coal fired plants to replace older plants or investing in the upgrading of existing coal fired plants 
any reduction in the amount of coal or possibly natural gas consumed by domestic electric power generators as a result of actual or potential regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could decrease demand for our fossil fuels  thereby reducing our revenues and materially and adversely affecting our business and results of operations 
we or our customers may also have to invest in carbon dioxide capture and storage technologies in order to burn coal or natural gas and comply with future ghg emission standards 

table of contents in addition  coalbed methane must be expelled from our underground coal mines for mining safety reasons 
coalbed methane enhances the ghg effect to a greater degree than carbon dioxide 
our gas operations capture coalbed methane from our underground coal mines  although some coalbed methane is vented into the atmosphere when the coal is mined 
if regulation of ghg emissions does not exempt the release of coalbed methane  we may have to further reduce our methane emissions  pay higher taxes  incur costs to purchase credits that permit us to continue operations as they now exist at our underground coal mines or perhaps curtail coal production 
the amount of coalbed methane we capture is reported  on a voluntarily basis  to the us department of energy 
we have recorded the amounts we have captured since the early s 
foreign currency fluctuations could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal abroad 
we compete in international markets against coal produced in other countries 
coal is sold internationally in us dollars 
as a result  mining costs in competing producing countries may be reduced in us dollar terms based on currency exchange rates  providing an advantage to foreign coal producers 
currency fluctuations among countries purchasing and selling coal could adversely affect the competitiveness of our coal in international markets 
our coal mining and gas operations are subject to operating risks  which could increase our operating expenses and decrease our production levels which could adversely affect our results of operations 
our coal and gas operations are also subject to hazards and any losses or liabilities we suffer from hazards which occur in our operations may not be fully covered by our insurance policies 
our coal mining operations are predominantly underground mines 
these mines are subject to a number of operating risks that could disrupt operations  decrease production and increase the cost of mining at particular mines for varying lengths of time thereby adversely affecting our operating results 
in addition  if coal production declines  we may not be able to produce sufficient amounts of coal to deliver under our long term coal contracts 
consol energy s inability to satisfy contractual obligations could result in our customers initiating claims against us 
the operating risks that may have a significant impact on our coal operations include variations in thickness of the layer  or seam  of coal  amounts of rock and other natural materials intruding into the coal seam and other geological conditions that could affect the stability of the roof and the side walls of the mine  equipment failures or repairs  fires  explosions or other accidents  weather conditions  and security breaches or terroristic acts 
our exploration for and production of natural gas also involves numerous operating risks 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating wells for coalbed methane cbm or other gas is often uncertain  and a number of factors can delay or prevent drilling operations  decrease production and or increase the cost of our gas operations at particular sites for varying lengths of time thereby adversely affecting our operating results 
the operating risks that may have a significant impact on our gas operations include unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or irregularities in geologic formations  equipment failures or repairs  fires  explosions or other accidents  
table of contents adverse weather conditions  reductions in natural gas prices  security breaches or terroristic acts  pipeline ruptures  and unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  other field services and equipment 
although we maintain insurance for a number of hazards  we may not be insured or fully insured against the losses or liabilities that could arise from a significant accident in our coal or gas operations 
our focus on new development projects in our operating areas and other unexplored areas increases the risks inherent in our gas and oil activities 
we hold substantial acreage on which there are no proved gas reserves in pennsylvania  ohio  kentucky  west virginia and tennessee 
over time  we plan to drill a number of wells in our undeveloped acreage 
these exploration  drilling and production activities will be subject to many risks  including the risk that cbm or other natural gas is not present in sufficient quantities in the coal seam or target strata  or that sufficient permeability does not exist for the gas to be produced economically 
drilling for cbm  other natural gas and oil may involve unprofitable efforts  not only from dry wells but also from wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient net gas reserves to return a profit after deducting drilling  operating and other costs 
we cannot be certain that the wells we drill in these new areas will be productive or that we will recover all or any portion of our investments 
a decrease in the availability or increase in the costs of commodities  key services  or capital equipment used in mining or gas operations  such as steel  liquid fuels and rubber products we use in mining operations or drilling rigs we use to drill gas wells in our gas operations  could impact our cost of production and decrease our anticipated profitability 
coal mines consume large quantities of key services  capital equipment and commodities including steel  copper  rubber products and liquid fuels 
some commodities  such as steel  are needed to comply with roof control plans required by regulation 
the prices we pay for these services and products are strongly impacted by the global market 
a rapid or significant increase in the costs of commodities  key services or capital equipment we use in our operations could impact our mining operations costs because we may have a limited ability to negotiate lower prices  and  in some cases  may not have a ready substitute 
in gas operations we contract with third parties for well services  related equipment  and qualified experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations 
the demand for these services in the natural gas and oil industry can fluctuate significantly  often in correlation with natural gas and oil prices causing periodic shortages 
these shortages may lead to escalating prices  the possibility of poor services  inefficient drilling operations and personnel injuries 
such pressures will likely increase the actual cost of services  extend the time to secure such services and add costs for damages due to accidents sustained from the over use of equipment and inexperienced personnel 
higher oil and natural gas prices generally stimulate increased demand and result in increased prices for drilling equipment  crews and associated supplies  equipment and services 
in addition  the costs and delivery times of equipment and supplies are substantially greater in periods of peak demand 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will be able to obtain necessary drilling equipment and supplies in a timely manner or on satisfactory terms  and we may experience shortages of  or increases in the costs of  drilling equipment  crews and associated supplies  equipment and services in the future 
any such delays and price increases could adversely affect our ability to pursue our drilling program and our results of operations 
we attempt to mitigate the risks involved with increased industrial activity by entering into take or pay contracts with well service providers which commit them to provide services to us at specified levels and commit us to pay for services at specified levels even if we do not use those services 
however  these contracts expose us 
table of contents to economic risk 
for example  if the price of natural gas declines and it is not economical to drill and produce additional natural gas  we may have to pay for services that we did not use 
this would decrease our cash flow and raise our costs of production 
for mining and drilling operations  consol energy must obtain  maintain  and renew governmental permits and approvals which if we cannot obtain in a timely fashion would reduce our production  cash flow and results of operations 
most coal producers in the eastern us are being impacted by government regulations and enforcement to a much greater extent than a few years ago  particularly in light of the renewed focus by environmental agencies and the government generally on the mining industry  including more stringent enforcement of the laws that regulate mining 
the pace with which the government issues permits needed for new operations and for on going operations to continue mining has negatively impacted expected production  especially in central appalachia 
environmental groups in southern west virginia and kentucky have challenged state and us army corps of engineers permits for mountaintop mining on various grounds 
the most recent challenges have focused on the adequacy of the corps of engineers analysis of impacts to streams and the adequacy of mitigation plans to compensate for stream impacts resulting from valley fill permits required for mountaintop mining 
in  the us district court for the southern district of west virginia found other operators permits for mining in these areas to be deficient 
in february  the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit reversed that decision  finding that the permits were adequate 
however  since that reversal  the us environmental protection agency epa began to more critically review valley fill permits and permits for all types of coal mining operations  and has been recommending that a number of permits be denied because of alleged concerns by the epa of potential impacts to water quality in streams below mining operations  with cumulative impacts of mining on watersheds 
the epa s objections and an enhanced review process that is being implemented under a federal multi agency memorandum of understanding have effectively held up the issuance of permits for all types of mining operations that require clean water act section discharge permits and section dredge and fill permits  including surface facilities for underground mines  without any indication as to when normal permitting will resume 
consol energy s surface and underground operations have been impacted to a limited extent to date  but future permits will likely be delayed by the epa s current position  which will likely adversely impact our surface operations 
in addition  the length of time needed to bring a new mine into production has increased by several years because of the increased time required to obtain necessary permits 
these delays or denials of mining permits could reduce our production  cash flow and results of operations 
existing and future government laws  regulations and other legal requirements relating to protection of the environment  health and safety matters and others that govern our business have increased our costs of doing business for both coal and gas  and may restrict both our coal and gas operations 
we are subject to laws  regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal  state and local  as well as foreign authorities relating to protection of the environment and health and safety matters 
these include those legal requirements that govern discharges of substances into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes  the cleanup of contaminated sites  groundwater quality and availability  plant and wildlife protection  reclamation and restoration of mining or drilling properties after mining or drilling is completed  the installation of various safety equipment in our mines  control of surface subsidence from underground mining and work practices related to employee health and safety 
complying with these requirements  including the terms of our permits  has had  and will continue to have  a significant effect on our costs of operations and competitive position 
for example  we have agreed to commence operation by may  of a new advanced waste water treatment plant to treat the discharge of mine water from our blacksville  loveridge and robinson run mines 
this treatment plant will cost an estimated to million to construct 
in addition  we could incur substantial costs as a result of violations under environmental and health and safety laws 
any additional laws  regulations and other legal requirements enacted or adopted by federal  state and local  as well as foreign authorities or new interpretations of existing legal requirements by regulatory bodies relating to the protection of the environment and health and safety matters could further affect our costs of operations and competitive position 

table of contents for example  the federal clean water act and corresponding state laws affect coal mining and gas operations by imposing restrictions on discharges into regulated surface waters 
permits requiring regular monitoring and compliance with effluent limitations and reporting requirements govern the discharge of pollutants into regulated waters 
the clean water act and corresponding state laws including those relating to protection of impaired waters not meeting state water quality standards through the use of effluent limitations established so that all discharges to the impaired stream do not exceed total maximum daily load tmdl levels of the pollutants causing the impairment  anti degradation regulations which protect state designated high quality exceptional use streams by restricting or prohibiting discharges which result in degradation  and requirements to treat discharges from coal mining properties for non traditional pollutants requiring expensive treatment technologies  such as total dissolved solids  chlorides and selenium  and protecting streams  wetlands  other regulated water sources and associated riparian lands from the surface impacts of underground mining may cause consol energy to incur additional costs that could adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and cash flows or may prevent us from being able to mine portions of our reserves 
the clean water act is being used by opponents of mountain top removal mining as a means to challenge permits 
also  beginning in early  the epa has relied upon the clean water act to become more actively involved in the permitting of mountain top removal mining operations and other coal mining operations requiring permits to place fill material in streams 
in addition  consol energy incurs and will continue to incur costs associated with the investigation and remediation of environmental contamination under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act superfund and similar state statutes and has been named as a potentially responsible party at superfund sites in the past 
additionally  the gas industry is subject to extensive legislation and regulation  which is under constant review for amendment or expansion 
any changes may affect  among other things  the pricing or marketing of gas production 
state and local authorities regulate various aspects of gas drilling and production activities  including the drilling of wells through permit and bonding requirements  the spacing of wells  the unitization or pooling of gas properties  environmental matters  safety standards  market sharing and well site restoration 
if we fail to comply with statutes and regulations  we may be subject to penalties  which would decrease our profitability 
our mines are subject to stringent federal and state safety regulations that increase our cost of doing business at active operations and may place restrictions on our methods of operation 
in addition  government inspectors under certain circumstances  have the ability to order our operations to be shut down based on safety considerations 
a mine could be shut down for an extended period of time if a disaster were to occur at it 
stringent health and safety standards were imposed by federal legislation when the federal coal mine health and safety act of was adopted 
the federal coal mine safety and health act of expanded the enforcement of safety and health standards of the coal mine health and safety act of and imposed safety and health standards on all non coal as well as coal mining operations 
regulations are comprehensive and affect numerous aspects of mining operations  including training of mine personnel  mining procedures  the equipment used in mine emergency procedures  mine plans and other matters 
the additional requirements of the mine improvement and new emergency response act of the miner act and implementing federal regulations include  among other things  expanded emergency response plans  providing additional quantities of breathable air for emergencies  installation of refuge chambers in underground coal mines  installation of two way communications and tracking systems for underground coal mines  new standards for sealing mined out areas of underground coal mines  more available mine rescue teams and enhanced training for emergencies 
most states in which consol energy operates have programs for mine safety and health regulation and enforcement 
we believe that the combination of federal and state safety and health regulations in the coal mining industry is  perhaps  the most comprehensive system for protection of employee safety and health affecting any industry 
most aspects of mine operations  particularly underground mine operations  are subject to extensive regulation 
the various requirements mandated by law or regulation can place restrictions on our methods of operations  creating a significant effect on operating costs and productivity 
in addition  government inspectors under certain 
table of contents circumstances  have the ability to order our operation to be shut down based on safety considerations 
if a disaster were to occur at one of our mines  it could be shutdown for an extended period of time and our reputation with our customers could be materially damaged 
in west virginia there are areas where drainage from coal mining operations contains concentrations of selenium that without treatment would result in violations of state water quality standards that are set to protect fish and other aquatic life 
consol energy has two operations with selenium discharges 
consol energy and other coal companies are working to expeditiously develop cost effective means to remove selenium from mine water 
if such technology is not developed promptly  the only available effective treatment technologies are expensive to construct and operate which will increase coal production costs 
our operations may impact the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances  and our properties may have environmental contamination  which could result in liabilities to us 
our operations currently use hazardous materials and generate limited quantities of hazardous wastes from time to time 
drainage flowing from or caused by mining activities can be acidic with elevated levels of dissolved metals  a condition referred to as acid mine drainage 
we could become subject to claims for toxic torts  natural resource damages and other damages as well as for the investigation and clean up of soil  surface water  groundwater  and other media 
such claims may arise  for example  out of conditions at sites that we currently own or operate  as well as at sites that we previously owned or operated  or may acquire 
our liability for such claims may be joint and several  so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of the contamination or other damages  or for the entire share 
we maintain extensive coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments at a number of our mining complexes 
such areas and impoundments are subject to extensive regulation 
our coal refuse areas and slurry impoundments are designed  constructed  and inspected by our company and by regulatory authorities according to stringent environmental and safety standards 
structural failure of a slurry impoundment or coal refuse area could result in extensive damage to the environment and natural resources  such as bodies of water that the coal slurry reaches  as well as liability for related personal injuries and property damages  and injuries to wildlife 
some of our impoundments overlie mined out areas  which can pose a heightened risk of failure and of damages arising out of failure 
if one of our impoundments were to fail  we could be subject to claims for the resulting environmental contamination and associated liability  as well as for fines and penalties 
these and other similar unforeseen impacts that our operations may have on the environment  as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with our operations  could result in costs and liabilities that could adversely affect us 
consol energy has reclamation  mine closing and gas well plugging obligations 
if the assumptions underlying our accruals are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
the surface mining control and reclamation act establishes operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
also  state laws require us to plug gas wells and reclaim well sites after the useful life of our gas wells has ended 
consol energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance  gas well plugging and of final mine closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation  mine closing liabilities and gas well plugging  which are based upon permit requirements and our experience  were approximately million at december  the amounts recorded are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future closure costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rates 
furthermore  these obligations are unfunded 
if these accruals are insufficient or our liability in a particular year is greater than currently anticipated  our future operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents consol energy faces uncertainties in estimating our economically recoverable coal and gas reserves  and inaccuracies in our estimates could result in lower than expected revenues  higher than expected costs and decreased profitability 
there are uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff 
some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable coal reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs  including the cost of materials 
similarly  natural gas reserves require subjective estimates of underground accumulations of natural gas and assumptions concerning natural gas prices  production levels  and operating and development costs 
as a result  estimated quantities of proved gas reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be incorrect 
over time  material changes to reserve estimates may be made  taking into account the results of actual drilling  testing and production 
also  we make certain assumptions regarding natural gas prices  production levels  and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect 
any significant variance from these assumptions to actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of our gas reserves  the economically recoverable quantities of natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  the classifications of gas reserves based on risk of recovery  and estimates of the future net cash flows 
numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based  as described above  often result in the actual quantities of gas we ultimately recover being different from reserve estimates 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated natural gas reserves 
we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved gas reserves on historical average prices and costs 
however  actual future net cash flows from our gas and oil properties also will be affected by factors such as geological conditions  changes in governmental regulations and taxation  the amount and timing of actual production  future operating costs  and capital costs of drilling new wells 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the natural gas and oil industry in general 
in addition  if natural gas prices decline by per thousand cubic feet  then the pre tax present value using a discount rate of our proved gas reserves as of december  would decrease from billion to billion 
the standardized generally accepted accounting principle measure associated with this decline of per thousand cubic feet  would be approximately billion 

table of contents each of the factors which impacts reserve estimation may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating the reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of coal and gas reserves may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our coal and gas reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
as a result  our estimates may not accurately reflect our actual coal and gas reserves 
we may incur additional costs and delays to produce coal and gas because we have to acquire additional property rights to perfect our title to coal or gas rights 
while chain of title for our coal estate generally has been established  there may be defects in it that we do not realize until we have committed to developing those properties or coal reserves 
as such  the title to the coal estate that we intend to mine may contain defects 
in order to conduct our mining operations on properties where these defects exist  we may incur unanticipated costs perfecting title 
some of the gas rights we believe we control are in areas where we have not yet done any exploratory or production drilling 
many of these properties were acquired primarily for the coal rights  and  in many cases were acquired years ago 
while chain of title work for the coal estate was generally established  in some cases  the gas estate title work is less developed 
our practice is to perform a thorough title examination of the gas estate before we commence drilling activities and to acquire any additional rights needed to perfect our ownership of the gas estate for development and production purposes 
we may incur substantial costs to acquire these additional property rights and the acquisition of the necessary rights may not be feasible in some cases 
our inability to obtain these rights may adversely impact our ability to develop those properties 
some states permit us to produce the gas without perfected ownership under an administrative process known as pooling  which require us to give notice to all potential claimants and pay royalties into escrow until the undetermined rights are resolved 
as a result  we may have to pay royalties to produce gas on acreage that we control and these costs may be material 
further  the pooling process is time consuming and may delay our drilling program in the affected areas 
our subsidiaries  primarily fairmont supply company  is a co defendant in various asbestos litigation cases which could result in making payments in the future that are material 
one of our subsidiaries  fairmont supply company fairmont  which distributes industrial supplies  currently is named as a defendant in approximately  asbestos claims in state courts in pennsylvania  ohio  west virginia  maryland  mississippi  new jersey  texas and illinois 
because a very small percentage of products manufactured by third parties and supplied by fairmont in the past may have contained asbestos and many of the pending claims are part of mass complaints filed by hundreds of plaintiffs against a hundred or more defendants  it has been difficult for fairmont to determine how many of the cases actually involve valid claims or plaintiffs who were actually exposed to asbestos containing products supplied by fairmont 
in addition  while fairmont may be entitled to indemnity or contribution in certain jurisdictions from manufacturers of identified products  the availability of such indemnity or contribution is unclear at this time and  in recent years  some of the manufacturers named as defendants in these actions have sought protection from these claims under bankruptcy laws 
fairmont has no insurance coverage with respect to these asbestos cases 
for the year ended december   payments by fairmont with respect to asbestos cases have not been material 
other of our subsidiaries may also have asbestos claims against them 
our current estimates related to these asbestos claims  individually and in the aggregate  are immaterial to the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of consol energy 
however  it is reasonably possible that payments in the future with respect to pending or future asbestos cases may be material to the financial position  results of operations or cash flows of consol energy 
consol energy and its subsidiaries are subject to various legal proceedings  which may have an adverse effect on our business 
we are party to a number of legal proceedings in the normal course of business activities 
defending these actions  especially purported class actions  can be costly  and can distract management 
for example  we are a 
table of contents defendant in four pending purported class action lawsuits dealing with such diverse matters as the propriety of our acquisition of the noncontrolling interest of cnx gas  our right to natural gas production in some areas  and asserting that we are responsible for hurricane katrina and the damage it caused 
there is the potential that the costs of defending litigation in an individual matter or the aggregation of many matters could have an adverse effect on our cash flows  results of operations or financial position 
see note commitments and contingent liabilities in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion of pending legal proceedings 
consol energy has obligations for long term employee benefits for which we accrue based upon assumptions which  if inaccurate  could result in consol energy being required to expense greater amounts than anticipated 
consol energy provides various long term employee benefits to inactive and retired employees 
we accrue amounts for these obligations 
at december   the current and non current portions of these obligations included postretirement medical and life insurance billion  coal workers black lung benefits million  salaried retirement benefits million  and workers compensation million 
however  if our assumptions are inaccurate  we could be required to expend greater amounts than anticipated 
salary retirement benefits are funded in accordance with erisa regulations 
the other obligations are un funded 
in addition  the federal government and several states in which we operate consider changes in workers compensation and black lung laws from time to time 
such changes  if enacted  could increase our benefit expense 
due to our participation in a multi employer pension plan  we have exposure under that plan that extends beyond what our obligation would be with respect to our employees 
certain of our subsidiaries are obligated to contribute to a multi employer defined benefit pension plan for united mine workers of america umwa retirees 
in the event of a partial or complete withdrawal by us from such pension plan  we would be liable for a proportionate share of such pension plan s unfunded vested benefits  as determined by the plan s actuary 
based on the information available from the plan s administrators  we believe that our portion of the contingent liability represented by the pension plan s unfunded vested benefits  in the case of our withdrawal from the pension plan or in the case of the termination of the pension plan  could be material to our financial position and results of operations 
in the event that any other contributing employer withdraws from such pension plan and such employer or any member in its controlled group cannot satisfy their obligations under the plan at the time of withdrawal  then we  along with the other remaining contributing employers  would be liable for an increase in our proportionate share of the pension plan s unfunded vested benefits at the time of the withdrawal from the pension plan or its termination 
the minimum funding level requirements of the pension protection act of pension act applicable to single employer and multi employer defined benefit pension plans  coupled with significant investment asset losses suffered by such pension plans during the recent decline in equity markets and the current volatile economic environment  have exposed consol energy to having to make additional cash contributions to fund the pension benefit plans which we sponsor and the multi employer pension benefit plan in which we participate 
certain subsidiaries of consol energy participate in a defined benefit multi employer pension plan pension trust negotiated with the united mine workers of america umwa and contained in the national 
table of contents bituminous coal wage agreement nbcwa 
the pension trust is overseen by a board of trustees  consisting of two union appointed trustees and two employer appointed trustees 
the trustees responsibilities include selection of the plan s investment policy  asset allocation  individual investment of plan assets and the administration of the plan 
the benefits provided by the pension trust to the participating employees are determined based on age and years of service at retirement 
the current nbcwa will expire on december  and calls for contribution amounts to be paid into the multi employer pension trust based principally on hours worked by umwa represented employees 
the contribution rates called for by the current nbcwa are per hour worked in  per hour worked in  per hour worked in and per hour worked in for the plan year ended june   approximately of retirees and surviving spouses receiving benefits from the pension trust last worked at signatory subsidiaries of consol energy 
as of june   the most recent date for which information is available  the pension trust was underfunded 
this determination was made in accordance with employer retirement income security act of erisa calculations  with a total actuarial asset value of billion and a total actuarial accrued liability of billion  or a funded percentage of approximately 
on october   certain subsidiaries of consol energy received notice from the trustees of the pension trust stating that the plan is considered to be seriously endangered for the plan year beginning july  under the pension protection act pension act  a funded percentage of should be maintained for this multi employer pension plan  and if the plan is determined to have a funded percentage of less than it will be deemed to be endangered or seriously endangered  and if less than  it will be deemed to be in critical status 
the funded percentage certified by the actuary for the pension trust was determined to be approximately under the pension act 
certain subsidiaries of consol energy face risks and uncertainties by participating in the pension trust 
all assets contributed to the plan are pooled and available to provide benefits for all participants and beneficiaries 
as a result  contributions made by signatory subsidiaries of consol energy benefit employees of other employers 
if the pension trust fails to meet erisa s minimum funding requirements or fails to develop and adopt a required rehabilitation plan  a nondeductible excise tax of five percent of the accumulated funding deficiency may be imposed on an employer s contribution to this multi employer pension plan 
as a result of the pension trust s seriously endangered status  steps must be taken under the pension act to improve the funded status of the plan 
these steps could result in requiring certain signatory subsidiaries of consol energy to make additional contributions pursuant to a funding improvement plan adopted and implemented in accordance with the pension act and  therefore  could have a material impact on our operating results 
see note other employee benefit plans in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion 
if lump sum payments made to retiring salaried employees pursuant to consol energy s defined benefit pension plan exceed the total of the service cost and the interest cost in a plan year  consol energy would need to make an adjustment to operating results equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum payment in that year  which may result in an adjustment that could reduce operating results 
consol energy s defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees allows such employees to receive a lump sum distribution for benefits earned up through december  in lieu of annual payments when they retire from consol energy 
employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans for terminations benefits requires that if the lump sum distributions made for a plan year exceed the total of the service cost and interest cost for the plan year  consol energy would need to recognize for that year s results of operations an adjustment equaling the unrecognized actuarial gain or loss resulting from each individual who received a lump sum in that year 
this type of adjustment may result in a reduction in operating results 

table of contents acquisitions that we have completed  acquisitions that we may undertake in the future  as well as expanding existing company mines  involve a number of risks  any of which could cause us not to realize the anticipated benefits and to the extent we engage in divestitures  the timing and proceeds thereof may not provide anticipated benefits 
on april  we completed the dominion acquisition for approximately billion 
we could encounter difficulties with the dominion acquisition  such as the need to revisit assumptions about gas reserves  future gas production  revenues  capital expenditures and operating costs  including realizing anticipated synergies  the loss of key employees or commercial relationships or the need to address unanticipated liabilities 
if we cannot successfully integrate our business  we may fail to realize the expected benefits of the acquisition 
we also continually seek to grow our business by adding and developing coal and gas reserves through acquisitions and by expanding the production at existing mines and existing gas operations 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the companies  businesses or properties we acquire  our profitability may decline and we could experience an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
mine expansion  gas operation expansion and acquisition transactions involve various inherent risks  including uncertainties in assessing the value  strengths  and potential profitability of  and identifying the extent of all weaknesses  risks  contingent and other liabilities including environmental liabilities of expansion and acquisition opportunities  the potential loss of key customers  management and employees of an acquired business  the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an expansion or an acquisition opportunity  problems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business  unanticipated changes in business  industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying our rationale for pursuing the expansion of the acquisition opportunity  and we may have to assume cleanup or reclamation obligations or other unanticipated liabilities in connection with these acquisitions 
from time to time part of our business and financing plans include the divestiture of certain assets 
however  we do not control the timing or the terms associated with them 
divestitures may not provide anticipated benefits or anticipated proceeds and may not occur when forecasted 
consol energy s rights plan may have anti takeover effects that may discourage a change of control even if doing so might be beneficial to our stockholders 
on december   consol energy adopted a rights plan which  in certain circumstances  including a person or group acquiring  or the commencement of a tender or exchange offer that would result in a person or group acquiring  beneficial ownership of more than of the outstanding shares of consol energy common stock  would entitle each right holder to receive  upon exercise of the right  shares of consol energy common stock having a value equal to twice the right exercise price 
for example  at an exercise price of per right  each right not otherwise voided would entitle its holders to purchase worth of shares of consol energy common stock for assuming that shares of consol energy common stock had a per share value of at such time  the holder of each right would be entitled to purchase ten shares of consol energy common stock for  or a price of per share  one half of its then market price 
this and other provisions of consol energy s rights plan could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire consol energy  which could hinder stockholders ability to receive a premium for consol energy stock over the prevailing market prices 
our financial performance could be adversely affected by our debt 
as of december   our total indebtedness was approximately billion of which approximately million was under our senior secured credit facility  million was under cnx gas secured revolving 
table of contents credit facility  million was under the securitization facility  million was under our senior secured notes due march  billion was under our senior unsecured notes due april  billion was under our senior unsecured notes due april  million was under our baltimore port facility revenue bonds due september  million of capitalized leases due through  and million of miscellaneous debt 
the degree to which we are leveraged could have important consequences  including  but not limited to increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development of our coal and gas reserves or other general corporate requirements  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and in the coal and gas industries  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less leveraged competitors 
our senior secured credit facility and the indentures governing our senior secured notes  and our and senior unsecured notes limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness unless specified tests or exceptions are met 
in addition  our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our and senior unsecured notes subject us to financial and or other restrictive covenants 
under our senior secured credit agreement  we must comply with certain financial covenants on a quarterly basis including a minimum interest coverage ratio  a maximum leverage ratio  and a maximum senior secured leverage ratio  as defined 
our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our and senior unsecured notes impose a number of restrictions upon us  such as restrictions on granting liens on our assets  making investments in joint ventures  paying dividends  selling assets and engaging in acquisitions 
failure by us to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default that  if not cured or waived  could have an adverse effect on us 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations  we may be forced to sell assets  seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness 
these alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations 
in the absence of such operating results and resources  we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to sell material assets or operations to attempt to meet our debt service and other obligations 
our senior secured credit agreement and the indentures governing our and senior unsecured notes restrict our ability to sell assets and use the proceeds from the sales 
we may not be able to consummate those sales or to obtain the proceeds which we could realize from them and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due 
unless we replace our gas reserves  our gas reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
producing natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
because total estimated proved reserves include our proved undeveloped reserves at december   production is expected to decline even if those proved undeveloped reserves are developed and the wells produce as expected 
the rate of decline will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change under other circumstances 
thus  our future natural gas reserves and production and  therefore  our cash flow and income are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs 

table of contents our shale gas drilling and production operations requires both adequate sources of water to use in the fracturing process as well as the ability to dispose of water after hydraulic fracturing 
our cbm gas drilling and production operations also require the removal and disposal of water from the coal seams from which we produce gas 
if we cannot find adequate sources of water for our use or are unable to dispose of the water we use or remove it from the strata at a reasonable cost and within applicable environmental rules  our ability to produce gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired 
as part of our drilling and production in the marcellus shale  we use hydraulic fracturing processes 
thus  we need access to adequate sources of water to use in our marcellus shale operations 
further  we must remove the water that we use to fracture our shale gas wells when it flows back to the well bore 
in addition  in our cbm drilling and production  coal seams frequently contain water that must be removed and disposed of in order for the gas to detach from the coal and flow to the well bore 
our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water with respect to our marcellus shale operations  or the inability to dispose of or recycle water used in our marcellus shale and our cbm operations  could adversely impact our operations 
moreover  the imposition of new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste 
these include  but are not limited to  produced water  drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration  development or production of natural gas 
these impositions may increase operating costs and cause delays  interruptions or termination of operations  the extent of which cannot be predicted  all of which could have an adverse affect on our operations and financial performance 
for example  concerns over the impact of hydraulic fracturing on watersheds have led to a moratorium on drilling in the marcellus shale in new york state 
our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks 
to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of natural gas  we enter into hedging arrangements with respect to a portion of our expected production 
as of january   we had hedges on approximately billion cubic feet of our natural gas production  billion cubic feet of our natural gas production  billion cubic feet of our natural gas production and billion cubic feet of our natural gas production 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges 
in addition  such transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  the counterparties to our contracts fail to perform the contracts  or the creditworthiness of our counterparties or their guarantors is substantially impaired 
if our gas hedges would no longer qualify for hedge accounting  we will be required to mark them to market and recognize the adjustments through current year earnings 
this may result in more volatility in our income in future periods

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the global recovery for steel producers continued to gain strength in global blast furnace iron production was higher in than it is expected that global steel production rates will grow another in the recent flooding in australia has heightened steel producers concerns over security of supply of metallurgical coals 
we believe that steel producers who have a large exposure to limited geographic supply sources will diversify their supply base to reduce the risk of supply disruptions 
we believe this will increase the demand for us metallurgical coals 
demand for us metallurgical coal is expected to be very strong in due to global growth as well as improving domestic demand 
us steel mill utilization is currently at  and there are increasingly optimistic signs for the domestic metallurgical coal markets 
prices for hot rolled coil steel hrc have been steadily increasing  buoyed by strong us auto sales figures in december us auto markets are expected to continue recovery in  which will improve the outlook for the north american steel markets 
given the continued projected growth in the global markets as well as an accelerating north american recovery  we anticipate that metallurgical coal markets will gain strength through the steam coal outlook continues to improve  driven by declining inventories and increasing demand due to general economic recovery and favorable weather 
coal inventories at utilities were steadily drawn down in we believe that inventories at the end of december were million tons below inventories at the same time last year 
we believe that bituminous coal comprises half of this reduction in inventories and inventories in our major market areas mid atlantic and south atlantic markets are lower than in other regions of the us demand for northern appalachian coal is not only influenced by domestic demand from utilities but also from european utilities and cross over demand from metallurgical markets 
we expect european demand for us coal to be very strong in as european coal prices have recently hit two year highs 
south african and colombian coals continue to be pulled to developing countries like  china  brazil and india  allowing north america coal to fill the void 
we expect demand for northern appalachian coal will be very strong from four sources traditional markets  as a metallurgical crossover product  as a replacement for declining central appalachian production and from european utilities 
a strong start to the winter season has helped improve natural gas demand  however  the natural gas industry continues to face concerns of oversupply 
the supply of natural gas remains very strong due to the success of new shale plays and drilling in these plays to meet drilling commitments 
natural gas storage for is similar to levels and industrial demand for gas continues to grow as the economy recovers 
in addition to small increases in demand  we are seeing more supply responses to the current price environment 
canadian gas imports have decreased and liquefied natural gas lng imports have failed to materialize 
we are also seeing more companies redirect capital away from lower return gas basins towards liquids rich targets 
we expect these trends to help curb the growth in gas supply over the next one to two years 
several significant transactions occurred in the year ended december   including the following  on april   consol energy completed the acquisition of the appalachian oil and gas exploration and production business of dominion resources  inc  dominion acquisition for a cash payment of approximately billion  which was principally allocated to oil and gas properties  wells and well related equipment 
the acquisition included approximately trillion cubic feet equivalents tcfe of net proved reserves and million acres of oil and gas rights within the appalachian basin 
included in the acquired acreage are approximately thousand prospective net marcellus shale acres located predominantly in southwestern pennsylvania and northern west virginia 
the acquisition enhances consol energy s position in the strategic marcellus shale fairway by increasing its development assets 

table of contents on march   consol energy completed an offering of million shares of common stock  which generated net proceeds of approximately billion 
on april   consol energy issued billion of senior unsecured notes due in and billion of senior unsecured notes due in the equity and senior note proceeds were used in part to complete the dominion acquisition 
consol energy also amended and expanded its previous billion revolving credit facility to billion 
cnx gas also amended and expanded its previous million revolving credit facility to million 
these revolving credit facilities were amended and expanded to provide liquidity for future cash needs of the company 
on june   consol energy completed the acquisition of the outstanding shares of cnx gas common stock that it did not previously own for a cash payment of approximately million 
the transaction was effected by means of a cash tender offer for cnx gas shares at a price of per share  followed by a short form merger at the same price  in which cnx gas became a wholly owned subsidiary of consol energy 
consol energy previously owned approximately of the approximately million shares of cnx gas common stock outstanding 
an additional million cash payment was made to cancel previously vested cnx gas stock options 
consol energy financed the acquisition of cnx gas shares by means of internally generated funds  borrowings under its credit facilities and proceeds from its march  offering of common stock 
consol energy sold approximately million tons of high volatile metallurgical coal overseas in  to meet the growing global demand for steel and steel products 
this coal was previously sold by consol energy on the domestic steam market at lower average sales prices 
the new market for this coal has allowed expanded margins for coals we produce primarily from the pittsburgh seam 
consol energy sold approximately million tons of low volatile metallurgical coal produced at our buchanan mine  of which approximately was sold into the overseas metallurgical market at higher average prices than consol energy has received in the recent past 
consol energy s gas operations  together with the producing wells purchased in the dominion acquisition  produced a record billion cubic feet of gas 
although gas prices remain depressed  increased production has contributed to consol energy s net income 
because of the rapidly changing regulatory environment in which consol energy operates and various other issues that impact our industries  costs of our coal and gas production in the future may be impacted 
the impacts of these changes cannot be determined with certainty at this time 
situations that may impact our costs include the following items as a result of mine disasters as well as a continuing effort to improve the safety of coal mining  state and federal mine regulators have recently adopted and proposed new mine safety requirements  which impact our operations 
these regulations include  for example new standards for the incombustible content of combined coal dust  rock dust and other dust in underground coal mines  new standards for the amount of respirable dust in underground coal mines  the requirement to equip underground mining equipment with proximity detection devices capable of shutting the equipment down if a person gets too close to the equipment  and the requirements to replace existing seals underground with stronger seals and to monitor and regulate the quality of the mine atmosphere in sealed areas to prevent explosions or reduce their impact 
further  it is likely that regulatory authorities will increase the number of inspections at coal mines and will more strictly enforce existing safety laws and regulations 
new safety requirements and enhanced enforcement efforts typically increase the costs of our coal mining operations  which would impact our margins and results of operations 
state and federal environmental regulators have recently adopted and proposed new environmental regulations  and adopted new interpretations of existing regulations  which impact our operations 
these include mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from underground coal mines and gas operations  potential regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from coal fired electric generating facilities  a significant market for our coal  adoption of more stringent emission limits for currently 
table of contents regulated pollutants from coal fired electric generating facilities  regulation of coal combustion residuals under the resource conservation and recovery act  potential regulation of hydraulic fracturing of gas wells  more stringent interpretations of clean water act requirements resulting in the need to remove constituents of mine drainage that cannot be removed with existing treatment facilities  and or limiting areas that can be mined  more involvement by the epa in review of applications for new mines and renewals of applications for existing mines resulting in significant permit delays  and reconsideration of regulations relating to conducting surface mining operations near streams 
such new and enhanced environmental protection requirements are likely to increase the costs of our coal mining operations  which would impact our margins and results of operations 
enactment of laws or passage of regulations by the federal government  individual states or other countries regarding emissions from combustion of fossil fuels or establishing renewable energy standards could result in decreased consumption of coal and gas and lead to the switching to other energy technologies for electricity 
while climate change legislation in the us is unlikely in the next several years  it is likely that some form of legislation addressing global climate change or establishing renewable energy standards  or both  will be enacted in the future 
at this time it is not possible to determine when such legislation will be enacted or the impact of potential legislation on our operations or financial condition 
whether or not climate change legislation is enacted  the us environmental protection agency epa has found that carbon dioxide may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare an endangerment finding under the clean air act and is proposing regulations that would restrict carbon dioxide emissions from certain sources  however  the epa s endangerment finding and its authority to adopt such regulations is being challenged in the courts 
although  efforts to enact greenhouse gas legislation have failed  the epa is proceeding with greenhouse gas regulations 
in september  the epa finalized the mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas rule 
the current version of this rule requires reporting of emissions from coal mines and gas wells and associated facilities 
in december  the epa announced a proposed schedule for establishing greenhouse gas emission limits for fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities proposed regulations by july and final regulations by may the level of impact will depend on numerous factors including the specific requirements imposed by legislation or rules  the timing of legislation or rules  time period for compliance  and the timing and commercial development of technologies associated with carbon capture and sequestration 
ultimately  the impact of possible legislation or rules on our business will depend on the degree to which electric power generators are forced to reduce their consumption of coal or gas  install expensive technologies for carbon capture and sequestration  or switch to alternative energy sources 
consol energy believes that if climate change legislation or rules are passed  gas will be impacted to a lesser degree than coal and the company has made strategic investment decisions to change its portfolio of assets to increase the contribution of gas to the company s business 
in fact  over the short term  consol energy expects gas to be the preferred fuel source for new power plants 
over the long term  consol energy believes that with the development of new technologies for carbon capture and sequestration  both coal and gas will continue to be used as clean and competitive fuel sources for electricity generation 
as standards continue to become more stringent on water discharge quality  consol energy will incur additional costs to build and operate facilities to treat water 
for example  consol energy completed construction of a new mine water treatment facility at its buchanan mine in virginia in for a total cost of approximately million 
it is also in the process of designing and permitting another facility to process mine water from the active blacksville  loveridge and robinson run mines and the closed four states mine in northern west virginia 
the existing facility and the one being permitted are designed to remove chlorides to insure compliance with state and federal water discharge standards 
these new facilities will also remove other dissolved constituents  such as sulfates 
construction of the west virginia facility is scheduled to be completed in with a total estimated cost of approximately million to million 
these facilities utilize state of the art equipment for water treatment including reverse osmosis  evaporation and crystallization technologies 
in  consol energy will also complete construction of pipelines with diffusers to convey high chloride mine water from the active 
table of contents shoemaker mine and the closed windsor mine and discharge those waters into approved mixing zones in the ohio river 
finally  at the bailey mine in pennsylvania  consol energy will start construction in of a new water handling system that will prevent discharge of water containing high total dissolved solids into area streams 
although these items primarily impact consol energy s coal business  management continues to believe our coal business will be successful in developing economic solutions to address these matters 
our coal business is also expected to continue to generate expanding margins due to our low volatile metallurgical coal business with our buchanan mine  our high volatile metallurgical coal business  where we are selling northern appalachian coal to asian and brazilian steelmakers at expanded margins  and lower thermal coal stockpiles 
we believe that coal will continue to provide the base load of the nation s energy needs 
through our efforts during the last years to improve our operating efficiencies at our major coal production sites  we believe we are well positioned to continue to provide our customers with low cost  high british thermal units btus coal that we expect will generate returns to our shareholders 
finally  consol energy is managing several other significant matters that will affect our business in the future the united mine workers of america umwa collective bargaining agreement expires on december  results of future agreements could have a significant effect on future cash flows and earnings of consol energy 
if a new collective bargaining agreement is not reached  consol energy could be impacted by work stoppages  which would impact our future coal production 
consolidation of consol energy s customer base continues to occur 
these consolidations may impact the creditworthiness of our customers  the amount of coal or gas a customer buys in a given year  and the terms of new sales contracts 
health care reform legislation included a revision to coal workers pneumoconiosis cwp regulations which will enable claimants to more easily qualify for a benefit 
the legislation also allows for a five year look back on claims to determine if a previously denied claim will now become eligible 
the new legislation impacted consol energy s cwp liability by approximately million  as described more fully in note coal workers pneumoconiosis cwp and workers compensation in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k 
consol energy continues to evaluate the potential sale of certain central appalachia metallurgical coal properties as well as other non core assets 
to date  there are no definitive agreements in place and evaluation of proposals continue 
results of operations year ended december  compared with year ended december  net income attributable to consol energy shareholders consol energy reported net income attributable to consol energy shareholders of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  net income attributable to consol energy shareholders was million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  see below for a detailed explanation by segment of the variance incurred in the period to period comparison 

table of contents the total coal segment includes steam coal  high volatile metallurgical coal  low volatile metallurgical coal and other coal 
the total coal segment contributed million of earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the total coal segment sold million tons of coal produced from consol energy mines  excluding our portion of tons sold from equity affiliates  in the year ended december  compared to million tons in the year ended december  the average sales price and total costs per ton for all active coal operations were as follows year ended december  variance percent change average sales price per ton sold average costs per ton sold margin the higher average sales price per ton sold reflects an additional million tons of low volatile metallurgical coal and million tons of high volatile metallurgical coal sold in compared to the low volatile metallurgical coal segment also had a higher average sales price in compared to reflecting the strengthening of the global steel market and steel related products 
the high volatile metallurgical coal global market has allowed approximately million tons of coal to be sold as a metallurgical product at an average sales price of per ton 
this coal historically would have been sold on the steam market where our average price for was per ton 
average costs per ton of coal sold have increased in the period to period comparison due primarily to additional labor  higher supply and maintenance costs  and increased other costs which are directly related to the higher sales prices received for tons sold 
additional labor costs per ton are related to the net addition of approximately employees 
the additional labor was attributed to the shoemaker mine resuming production in after being idled throughout to complete the replacement of the track haulage system to a more efficient belt haulage system 
additional labor was also added in order to run our mines more safely  to prepare for the expected retirement of a significant portion of our work force over the next five years  and to keep the development of the longwall panels ahead of longwall advancement 
additional supply costs were attributable to compliance with new safety regulations such as fire retardant belts  additional equipment maintenance and various changes in roof control measures 
costs directly related to the price received for coal sales have also increased 
these costs include royalty expenses and various production taxes 
the total gas segment includes coalbed methane cbm  conventional  marcellus and other gas 
the total gas segment contributed million of earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  total gas production was billion cubic feet for the year ended december  compared to billion cubic feet for the year ended december  the average sales price and total costs for all active gas operations were as follows year ended december  variance percent change average sales price per thousand cubic feet sold average costs per thousand cubic feet sold margin total gas segment outside sales revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the 
table of contents increase in volumes sold  offset  in part  by the reduction in average price per thousand cubic feet sold 
the decrease in average sales price is the result of various gas swap transactions that occurred throughout both periods 
these gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
average gas sales prices excluding the impact of hedging were up slightly in the period to period comparison 
total gas unit costs increased for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  primarily due to the impact of the higher cost structure of the producing wells purchased in the dominion acquisition 
these wells increased total operating costs by per thousand cubic feet due to the higher maintenance costs  higher gathering and transportation costs and lower volumes produced compared to the legacy consol energy wells 
excluding the impact of these purchased wells  unit costs improved per thousand cubic feet primarily due to the additional volumes produced 
volumes increased in the period to period comparison due to the on going drilling program and the additional volumes from the wells purchased in the dominion acquisition 
the other segment includes industrial supplies activity  terminal and river service activity  income taxes and other business activities not assigned to the coal or gas segment 

table of contents total coal segment analysis for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the coal segment contributed million of earnings before income tax in the year ended december  compared to million in the year ended december  variances by the individual coal segments are discussed below

table of contents steam coal revenue was  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  the million decrease was attributable to an average sales price reduction of per ton partially offset by a million increase in tons sold 
steam coal average sales price is lower in the period compared to the period as a result of higher average sales price mines  such as bailey and enlow fork  selling coal in the high volatile metallurgical coal market instead of the steam coal market 
this impacted the steam coal segment as a result of leaving more tons sold from lower sales price mines 
this has negatively impacted the average sales price on the steam coal segment  although total company revenue has improved 
produced steam inventory was million tons at december  compared to million tons at december  steam sales tons were higher in the period to period comparison primarily due to the shoemaker mine restarting production in early after being idled throughout to complete the replacement of the track haulage system 
steam sales tons were also higher as the result of the blacksville mine being idled for several months in in order to manage inventory levels in response to the economic crisis experienced 
blacksville mine has operated throughout these increases were offset  in part  due to selling million tons on the high volatile metallurgical coal market at approximately per ton higher average sales price 
other income attributable to the steam coal segment represents earnings from our equity affiliate that operates a steam coal mine 
the equity in earnings of affiliates is insignificant to the total segment activity 
operating costs are made up of labor  supplies  maintenance  subsidence  taxes other than income  royalties and preparation plant charges related to the extraction and sale of coal 
these costs are reviewed regularly by management and are considered to be the direct responsibility of mine management 
operating costs related to the steam coal segment were  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  higher operating costs in the period to period comparison are due to the per ton increase in average unit costs of tons sold and million of additional tons sold 
higher average operating costs per unit for steam coal tons sold are primarily related to the following items steam coal unit costs were higher in as a result of lower cost mines  such as bailey and enlow fork  selling coal in the high volatile metallurgical coal market 
this impacted the steam coal segment due to increased tons sold from higher cost mines 
labor costs increased due to the effects of wage increases at the union mines from the current labor contracts 
the contracts call for specified hourly wage increases in each year of the contract 
labor costs also increased due to the effects of wage increases at the non represented mines 
average employee counts also increased approximately at our active mining operations 
the additional employees were primarily due to the shoemaker mine resuming production in after being idled during to complete the replacement of the track haulage system to a more efficient belt haulage system 
additional employees were also added in order to run our mines more safely  to prepare for the expected retirement of a significant portion of our work force over the next five years  and to keep the development of the longwall panels ahead of longwall advancement 
health and retirement costs related to the active hourly work force increased due to higher contributions to the multiemployer pension trust that are required under the national bituminous coal wage agreement 
the contribution rate increased from per hour worked by members of the united mine workers union of america umwa in the year ended december  to per hour worked in the year ended december  contributions to the multiemployer plan are expensed as incurred 
health and retirement costs have also increased in the period to period comparison due to higher medical costs for the active hourly work force 
power costs increased due to higher rates charged by utility companies and increased usage in the period to period comparison 
operating costs also increased as a result of the million ton decrease in inventory levels 

table of contents the increases in average unit costs of steam coal sold were offset  in part  by the following reduced contract mining fees due to fewer contractors being retained to mine our reserves in the year ended december  compared to the period 
average operating costs per steam ton sold decreased due to higher tons sold 
fixed costs are allocated over higher tons resulting in decreased unit costs 
total consol energy expenses related to our actuarial liabilities were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was due primarily to changes in the discount rates used at the measurement date  which is december  and changes in assumptions which affect the amount of actuarial gains and losses amortized into earnings 
see note pension and other postretirement benefits plans and note coal workers pneumoconiosis cwp and workers compensation in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for additional detail regarding total company expense 
total provisions are made up of the expenses related to the company s long term liabilities  such as other post employment benefits opeb  the salary retirement plan  workers compensation  long term disability and accretion expense on mine closing and related liabilities 
with the exception of accretion expense on mine closing and related liabilities  these expenses are actuarially calculated for the company as a whole 
the expenses are then allocated to operational units based on active employee counts or active salary dollars 
accretion is calculated on a mine by mine basis 
provisions attributable to the steam coal segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  provision costs per steam coal ton sold increased per ton in the period to period comparison due primarily to higher actuarial expenses  such as opeb  as discussed above 
the overall increase in company costs has increased the total dollars allocated to the steam coal segment 
this increase was offset  in part  by additional tons sold by the steam coal segment 
total company selling  general and administrative expenses were made up of the following items variance percent change employee wages and related expenses commissions miscellaneous total company selling  general and administrative expenses employee wages and related expenses have increased due to additional employees in the selling  general and administrative area primarily related to support staff retained in the dominion acquisition and additional hiring to support operations 
increased employee wages and related expenses are also related to additional actuarial expenses discussed above 
commission expenses increased million due to additional tons for which a third party was owed a commission compared to the prior year period 
miscellaneous expenses have increased approximately million 
the increase was related to an additional million for advertising and promotion fees  an additional million for demurrage charges and an additional million for various other items  none of which were individually material 
total administrative and other costs related to the steam coal segment were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  selling  general and administrative costs  excluding selling expense  are allocated to all segments based on a combination of estimated time worked by various support groups and operating costs incurred by the individual segments 
commission expense  which is a component of selling  is charged directly to the mine incurring the cost 
direct 
table of contents administrative costs are associated directly with the coal segment of the business and are allocated to various mines based on a combination of estimated time worked and production 
although the total company selling  general and administrative costs have increased  as discussed above  the amount allocated to the steam coal segment has decreased approximately million 
the decrease in the amount allocated to the steam coal segment is primarily related to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment 
in  these tons and the associated allocation were all included in the steam coal segment 
depreciation  depletion and amortization costs for the steam coal segment were million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or per ton  was due to additional equipment and infrastructure placed into service after  offset  in part  by additional volumes sold 
high vol metallurgical coal segment the high volatile metallurgical coal segment contributed million to total company earnings before income tax for the year ended december  there was no activity in this segment in the prior year 
this is a new market that has developed in and is primarily related to selling our pittsburgh coal into overseas metallurgical coal markets 
this coal had historically supplied the domestic steam coal market 
the high volatile metallurgical coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows variance percent change produced high vol met tons sold in millions average sales price per high vol met ton sold average operating costs per high vol met ton sold average provision costs per high vol met ton sold average selling  administrative and other costs per high vol met ton sold average depreciation  depletion and amortization costs per high vol met ton sold total costs per high vol met ton sold margin the high volatile metallurgical coal segment revenue was million  or an average sales price per ton of  for the year ended december  strength in the metallurgical coal market has allowed for the export of northern appalachian coal  historically sold domestically on the steam coal market  to crossover to the metallurgical coal markets in brazil and asia 
total costs per ton sold of this coal were generating a margin of per ton sold 
this margin exceeds the per ton average margin received on steam coal sold in which is where this coal would have been historically sold 
other income attributable to the high volatile metallurgical coal segment represents earnings from our equity affiliates that operate mines that sell coal on the high volatile metallurgical coal market 
the equity in earnings of affiliates is insignificant to the total segment activity 

table of contents low vol metallurgical coal segment the low volatile metallurgical coal segment contributed million to total company earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was due primarily to the buchanan mine being idled for approximately five months of the mine was idled in in response to the economic crisis which significantly lowered the demand for low volatile metallurgical coal  primarily due to the decrease in steel demand 
the buchanan mine has operated throughout all of the low volatile metallurgical coal revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows variance percent change produced low vol met tons sold in millions average sales price per low vol met ton sold average operating costs per low vol met ton sold average provision costs per low vol met ton sold average selling  administrative and other costs per low vol met ton sold average depreciation  depletion and amortization costs per low vol met ton sold total costs per low vol met ton sold margin average sales price for low volatile metallurgical coal has increased per ton  from the prior year  to for the year ended december  the increase of is mainly due to the strengthening of the global market for steel and steel related products when compared to total costs per ton sold of low volatile metallurgical coal were per ton for the year ended december  compared to per ton for the year ended december  the per ton improvement was related to operating the buchanan mine for all of versus seven months of the additional tonnage sold in has reduced the average per unit costs 
other coal segment the other coal segment had a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  the other coal segment includes purchased coal activities  idled mine activities as well as various other activities assigned to the coal segment but not allocated to each individual mine 
other coal segment produced coal sales revenue was million for the year ended december  this revenue includes the sale of incidental tonnage recovered during the reclamation process at idled facilities 
the primary focus of activity at these locations is reclaiming disturbed land in accordance with permit requirements after final mining has occurred 
the tons sold from these activities are incidental to total company production and sales 
purchased coal sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications  coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for a fee 
freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred 
this revenue is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie rail  barge  truck  etc 
used by 
table of contents the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight revenue is offset in freight expense 
freight revenue was million in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to lower tons being shipped on consol energy freight contracts in the period to period comparison 
miscellaneous other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease was due to the following items in the year ended december   million of income was recognized related to contracts with certain customers that were unable to take delivery of previously contracted coal tonnage 
these customers agreed to buy out their contracts in order to be released from the requirements of taking delivery of previously committed tons 
no such transactions were entered into in the year ended december  gain on sales of assets attributable to the other coal segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the change was related to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
coal royalty income from third parties was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was related to lower tons mined by third parties from our coal reserves in the period to period comparison 
in the year ended december   mark to market adjustments for free standing coal sales options resulted in approximately a million reversal of previously recognized unrealized losses 
the reversal of the losses was primarily due to the decrease in market price of coal in compared to no such transactions existed in the year ended december  other income increased million due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
other coal segment total costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was due to the following items closed and idle mine costs increased approximately million for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in closed and idle mine costs was primarily related to additional reclamation liabilities recognized at the fola mining operation in west virginia 
as a result of market conditions  permitting issues  new regulatory requirements and resulting changes in mine plans  the reclamation liability associated with the fola operation increased approximately million 
additional closed and idle mine costs in were also related to a million charge as a result of a change in the mine plan at mine as a result of the mine plan change  a portion of the previously developed area of the mine has been abandoned 
these increases were offset  in part  by approximately million for changes in the operational status of various other mines  between idled and operating  throughout both periods which resulted in lower idled mine costs in shoemaker mine was idled throughout while the track haulage system was converted to a belt haulage system 
this mine was in production throughout litigation expense of million was recognized for the year ended december  related to a settlement that was reached in june the litigation was related to water discharge from our buchanan mine being stored in mine voids of adjacent properties which were leased by consol energy subsidiaries 
cost of goods sold and other charges have increased approximately million related to excess purchase price over appraised values for various land purchases that have been made throughout the year 
accounting guidance requires assets purchased to be recognized at the appraised value  synergies 
table of contents and related specific value to consol energy cannot be reflected as an asset 
various land deals in strategic areas for items such as refuse ponds  overland belts and various other key projects often require premiums over fair value  thus resulting in additional expense to consol energy at the time of the transaction 
litigation settlement expense of million was recognized for the year ended december  related to the sale of the jones fork mining complex 
cost of goods sold and other charges have increased approximately million due to various asset abandonments throughout the period  none of which were individually material 
these abandonments primarily related to engineering work  permitting work and mapping work for miscellaneous projects that are no longer being pursued by the company 
purchased coal consists of costs from processing purchased coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specifications  coal purchased and sold directly to the customer and costs for processing third party coal in our preparation plants 
these costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to reduced purchased coal volumes in the period to period comparison 
litigation expense of million was recognized for the year ended december  related to amounts accrued for the settlement of the levisa action and the pobst combs action 
this litigation related to depositing water in mine voids which a subsidiary of consol energy leased 
freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie rail  barge  truck  etc 
used by the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight expense is offset in freight revenue 
freight expense was million in the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily due to fewer tons shipped on consol energy freight contracts in the period to period comparison 
other costs have decreased million primarily due to various contingent liabilities related to potential legal settlements as well as various other transactions that have occurred throughout both periods  none of which are individually material 

table of contents total gas segment analysis for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the gas segment contributed million to earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  variances by the individual gas segments are discussed below

table of contents cbm sales revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to the reduction in average price per thousand cubic feet sold  offset  in part  by the increase in volumes sold 
the decrease in cbm average sales price is the result of various gas swap transactions at a lower average price as compared to the prior year 
these gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced cbm gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced cbm gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
average gas sales prices excluding the impact of hedging were per thousand cubic feet in compared to per thousand cubic feet in cbm sales volumes increased billion cubic feet primarily due to additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program 
we had  net cbm wells at december  compared to  net cbm wells at december  also  cbm volumes were lower by approximately billion cubic feet of deferrals related to the idling of the buchanan mine for approximately five months during total costs for the cbm gas segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase in total costs in the period to period comparison reflects the increase in average unit costs and the increase in sales volumes 
cbm lifting costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  average cbm lifting costs per unit were per thousand cubic feet for compared to per thousand cubic feet for the improvement in average cbm lifting costs per unit was due to lower salt water disposal costs attributable to recycling the water produced from our wells to be used in hydraulic fracturing of new wells 
previously  fees were incurred to dispose of the salt water produced from our wells 
unit costs were also improved due to higher volumes of cbm gas sold in the period to period comparison resulting in fixed costs being spread over additional volumes  lowering the average per unit costs 
these improvements were offset  in part  by higher severance taxes 
higher severance taxes were the result of average market price increases  excluding the impact of our hedging program 
severance taxes are also higher as a result of the buchanan county  virginia severance tax settlement which changed the deductions allowed in the calculation of severance tax due when the price of gas falls between certain ranges 
see note commitments and contingent liabilities in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion 
cbm gathering costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  average cbm gathering cost were per thousand cubic feet sold for the year ended december  compared to per thousand cubic feet sold for the year ended december  higher average unit costs were related to higher power costs attributable to utility rate increases in the period to period comparison as well as increased usage 
higher average unit costs were also attributable to additional in transit costs related to additional capacity of firm transportation being purchased after to assure delivery of additional volumes being produced 
these cost increases were offset  in part  by the increase in volumes sold 
general and administrative costs attributable to the total gas segment have increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to additional staffing and additional corporate service charges from consol energy 
with the dominion acquisition  which closed on april   the majority of the operational support personnel were retained 
total company general and administrative costs have also increased  as explained previously  which resulted in additional charges being allocated to all segments 
general and administrative costs attributable to the cbm gas segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses attributable to the total gas segment are allocated to each individual gas segment based on a 
table of contents combination of production and employee counts 
although total gas general and administrative costs have increased million  as discussed above  the percentage allocated to the cbm segment is lower  on a unit basis  as the result of cbm production volumes to total gas volumes produced being lower primarily due to the dominion acquisition 
depreciation  depletion and amortization attributable to the cbm segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  there was approximately million  or per unit of production  of depreciation  depletion and amortization related to cbm gas and related well equipment that was reflected on a units of production method of depreciation in the year ended december  the unit of production portion of depreciation  depletion and amortization was million  or per unit of production in the year ended december  the cbm unit of production rate used to calculate depreciation in the current year is generally calculated using the net book value of assets divided by either proved or proved developed reserves at the previous year end 
the in field drilling program and certain assets acquired in the dominion acquisition caused the rate to increase 
there was approximately million  or per thousand cubic feet of depreciation  depletion and amortization related to gathering and other equipment that is reflected on a straight line basis for the year ended december  the straight line component was million  or per thousand cubic feet for the year ended december  the increase was related to additional gathering assets placed in service after  offset  in part  by the increase in volumes in the period to period comparison 
conventional segment the conventional segment had a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  the conventional segment revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows variance percent change produced gas conventional sales volumes in billion cubic feet average conventional sales price per thousand cubic feet sold average conventional lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold average conventional gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold average conventional general administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold average conventional depreciation  depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold total conventional costs per thousand cubic feet sold margin conventional segment sales revenues were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  conventional sales volumes increased billion cubic feet for the year ended december  primarily due to the dominion acquisition 
approximately of the acquired producing wells were conventional type wells 
there were  net conventional wells at december compared to net conventional wells at december  no conventional gas volumes were hedged in or total costs for the conventional segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million is attributable to additional volumes sold in the period to period comparison  offset  in part  by lower average unit costs sold 
conventional average unit costs have decreased due to the significant increase in volumes related to production from wells acquired in the dominion acquisition 
a detailed analysis of cost categories is not meaningful due to the significant change in this segment related to the dominion acquisition and will therefore not be presented 

table of contents general and administrative costs attributable to the total gas segment are allocated to each individual gas segment based on a combination of production and employee counts 
conventional volumes are higher as a percent of total gas produced volumes in the period to period comparison and therefore  additional general and administrative costs have been allocated to the conventional gas segment in marcellus segment the marcellus segment contributed million to the total company earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the marcellus segment revenue and cost components on a per unit basis are as follows variance percent change produced gas marcellus sales volumes in billion cubic feet average marcellus sales price per thousand cubic feet sold average marcellus lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold average marcellus gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold average marcellus general administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold average marcellus depreciation  depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold total marcellus costs per thousand cubic feet sold margin the increase in marcellus average sales price was the result of an improvement in general market prices and various gas swap transactions that occurred in the year ended december  these gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced marcellus gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
there were no gas swap transactions for the marcellus segment that occurred for the year ended december  the increase in sales volumes was primarily due to additional wells coming online from our on going drilling program 
at december  there were marcellus shale wells in production including wells acquired in the dominion acquisition 
at december  there were marcellus shale wells in production 
total costs for the marcellus segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to the additional sales volumes and higher average unit costs 
marcellus lifting costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  average marcellus lifting costs were per thousand cubic feet in compared to per thousand cubic feet in the increase in average lifting costs per unit sold was due to increased road repairs and other maintenance expense primarily related to the additional number of wells drilled in the current period 
salt water disposal fees were also higher in the period to period comparison due to the higher volume of water produced from additional wells 
these increases in costs were offset  in part  by the additional volume of marcellus gas sold in the period to period comparison 
marcellus gathering costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  average gathering cost per unit sold was per thousand cubic feet for the year ended december  compared to per thousand cubic feet for the year ended december  lower average gathering cost per unit was primarily attributable to the increase in volumes sold 
this improvement was offset  in part  by higher power and security costs 
higher power costs were related to higher rates being charged by utility companies in the period to period comparison 
higher security costs were related to additional security needs at various marcellus gathering stations 

table of contents general and administrative costs attributable to the marcellus gas segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  average general and administrative costs on a per unit sold basis were per thousand cubic feet for the year ended december  compared to per thousand cubic feet for the year ended december  general and administrative costs attributable to the total gas segment are allocated to each individual gas segment based on a combination of production and employee counts 
the total general and administrative cost increases  as discussed previously  were offset  in part  by higher volumes of gas produced from marcellus wells 
depreciation  depletion and amortization attributable to the marcellus segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  there was approximately million  or per unit of production  of depreciation  depletion and amortization related to marcellus gas and related well equipment that was reflected on a units of production method of depreciation in the year ended december  the unit of production portion of depreciation  depletion and amortization was million  or per unit of production in the year ended december  the marcellus unit of production rate used to calculate depreciation in the current year is generally calculated using the net book value of assets divided by either proved or proved developed reserves at the previous year end 
the investment in drilling activities increased in higher proportion than the related gas reserves in the current period  which resulted in a higher per unit rate 
there was approximately million  or per thousand cubic feet of depreciation  depletion and amortization related to gathering and other equipment that is reflected on a straight line basis for the year ended december  the straight line component was million  or per thousand cubic feet for the year ended december  the increase was related to additional gathering assets placed in service after  offset  in part  by the increase in volumes in the period to period comparison 
other gas segment the other gas segment includes activity not assigned to cbm  conventional or marcellus gas segments 
this segment includes purchased gas activity  gas royalty interest activity  exploration and other costs  other corporate expenses  and miscellaneous operational activity not assigned to a specific gas segment 
the other gas segment had a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  other gas sales volumes are primarily related to production from the chattanooga shale in tennessee 
revenue from this operation was approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  there was billion cubic feet sold from this area for the year ended december  compared to billion cubic feet for the year ended december  total costs related to these other sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in costs in the period to period comparison was primarily due to higher depreciation  depletion and amortization attributable to the additional billion cubic feet of gas produced and higher unit of production rates 
the higher units of production rates were related to a higher proportion of capital assets placed in service versus the proportion of proved developed reserve additions 
a per unit analysis of the other operating costs in chattanooga is not meaningful due to the low volumes produced in the period to period analysis 
royalty interest gas sales represent the revenues related to the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by the consol energy gas segment 
the changes in market prices  contractual differences among leases  and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties contributed to the period to period change

royalty interest gas sales costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  variance percent change gas royalty interest sales volumes in billion cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet sold purchased gas volumes represent volumes of gas purchased from third party producers that we sell 
purchased gas volumes also reflect the impact of pipeline imbalances 
the higher average cost per thousand cubic feet is due to overall price changes  contractual differences among customers and the pipeline imbalance 
purchased gas costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  variance percent change purchased gas volumes in billion cubic feet average cost per thousand cubic feet sold exploration and other costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was made up of the following items variance percent change dry hole and lease expiration costs land and delay rentals exploration total exploration and other costs dry hole and lease expiration costs were million higher in the period to period comparison primarily due to lease surrenders in the current year  offset  in part  by lower dry wells drilled in the year ended december  land and delay rentals  as well as exploration  both increased million in the period to period comparison due to various transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 

table of contents other corporate expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was due to the following items variance percent change short term incentive compensation stock based compensation variable interest earnings bank fees financing and acquisition fees contract settlement other total other corporate expenses the short term incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when the gas segment reaches predetermined targets for safety  production and unit cost goals 
short term incentive compensation expense is higher in due to a increase in employee counts  as well as an increase in the short term incentive compensation allocation to the gas segment 
additional employees in the total company general and administrative area were primarily related to support staff retained in the dominion acquisition and additional hiring to support operations 
stock based compensation is higher in the period to period comparison primarily due to the conversion of the cnx gas performance share units to consol energy restricted stock units in the year ended december  the conversion resulted in a reduction of approximately million of expense in additional expense was also related to stock based compensation allocated from consol energy to the gas segment in these increases were offset  in part  by the non vested cnx gas stock options being terminated in relation to the cnx gas take in transaction 
the expense previously recognized for these options was reversed on the gas segment 
all stock based compensation is now allocated from consol energy 
variable interest earnings are related to various adjustments a third party entity has reflected in its financial statements 
consol energy holds no ownership interest  but guarantees bank loans the entity holds related to its purchases of drilling rigs 
consol energy is also the main customer of the third party  and based on analysis is the primary beneficiary 
therefore  the entity is fully consolidated and then the impact is fully reversed in the noncontrolling interest line discussed below 
banks fees are higher in the period to period comparison due to amending and extending the revolving credit facility related to the gas segment 
financing and acquisition fees are related to legal expenses for the special committee  formed during the cnx gas take in transaction  and are primarily related to the shareholder litigation 
the year ended december  includes million of expense related to a contract buyout with a driller in order to mitigate idle rig charges in certain areas where drilling was not expected to increase in the near term 
other corporate expense increased million in the year to year comparison primarily due to unused firm transportation charges not being allocated to the operating gas segments and various other transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
interest expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  interest is incurred by the gas segment on the gas segment revolving credit facility  a capital lease and debt held by a variable interest entity 
no significant changes in these components occurred in the period to period comparison 

table of contents noncontrolling interest represents of the earnings impact of a third party which has been determined to be a variable interest entity  in which the consol energy gas segment holds no ownership interest  but is the primary beneficiary 
the consol energy gas segment has been determined to be the primary beneficiary due to guarantees of the third party s bank debt related to their purchase of drilling rigs 
the third party entity provides drilling services primarily to the consol energy gas segment 
consol energy consolidates the entity and then reflects of the impact as noncontrolling interest 
the consolidation does not significantly impact any amounts reflected in the gas segment income statement

table of contents the increase in average sales price in the year to year comparison primarily reflects higher prices negotiated in previous periods when there was a significant increase in the global demand for coal 
sales of company produced steam coal shipments decreased in due to delivery deferments of central and northern appalachian coals 
coal consumption by the electric power sector continued to decline during operating costs are made up of labor  supplies  maintenance  subsidence  taxes other than income  royalties and preparation plant charges related to the extraction and sale of coal 
these costs are reviewed regularly by management and are considered to be the direct responsibility of mine management 
operating costs related to the steam coal segment were  million for the year ended december  compared to  million for the year ended december  higher average operating costs per unit for steam coal tons sold is primarily related to the following items in general  average operating costs per unit increased due to the reduced amount of tons sold from consol energy mines 
the reduction in tons sold reflected the weak economic environment which affected electricity generation and correspondingly the demand for coal 
fixed costs incurred at our mining operations were spread over fewer tons sold  which negatively impacted average unit costs 
supply costs per unit are higher in due to higher supply and maintenance costs at several locations 
additional supply and maintenance projects were related to additional preparation plant maintenance  additional belt advancement costs  additional mining equipment maintenance  additional roof support  additional use of contract labor to complete belt projects and additional water handling costs 
these increased supply and maintenance costs were offset  in part  by fewer seals being constructed in previously mined areas 
average unit costs of supplies were also impacted by lower sales tons in the year to year comparison 
labor costs have increased due to the effects of wage increases at the union and non represented mines 
these contracts call for specified hourly wage increases in each year of the contract 
the average increase in unit cost for labor was also impacted by lower sales volumes due to the economic environment as discussed above 
production taxes per steam ton sold increased due to higher average sales prices received for this coal 
united mine workers of america umwa health and retirement plan expenses increased over primarily due to the effects of the labor contract that requires additional contributions to be made into employee benefit funds 
the contribution increase over was per united mine worker of america hour worked 
the average increase in unit costs for health and retirement plans was also impacted by lower sales tons in the year to year comparison 
subsidence costs increased primarily due to the year ended december  including additional expenses related to work to be performed on streams that have been impacted by underground mining in pennsylvania 
the average increase in unit costs for subsidence was also impacted by lower sales tons in the year to year comparison 
total provisions are made up of the expenses related to the company s long term liabilities such as other post employment benefits opeb  the salary retirement plan  workers compensation  long term disability and mine closing and related liabilities

the provision expense attributable to the steam coal segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  total consol energy expenses related to our actuarial liabilities were million for the years ended december  and provision costs per unit of steam tons sold increased in the period to period comparison due primarily to lower tons sold 

table of contents total company selling  general and administrative expenses variance percent change rentals employee wages and related expenses miscellaneous total company selling  general and administrative expenses total company selling  general and administrative costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase was due to the following items rentals have increased million primarily due to rent expense related to the new consol energy headquarters  offset  in part  by reduced rent related to the previous consol energy and cnx gas corporate office space that is no longer used 
wages  salaries and related benefits have increased approximately million primarily due to annual salary increases and additional recruiting expenses 
other selling  general and administrative costs decreased million due to various transactions throughout both periods  none of which are individually material 
total administrative and other costs include selling expenses  general and administrative expenses and direct administrative costs 
selling  general and administrative costs  excluding commission expense  are allocated to the mines on a combination of estimated time worked by various support groups and operating costs incurred at the mine 
commission expense  which is a component of selling expense  is charged directly to the mine incurring the cost 
direct administrative costs are associated directly with the coal segment of the business and are allocated to various mines based on a combination of estimated time worked and production 
total administrative and other costs related to the steam coal segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  average selling  general and administrative costs per unit have increased due to lower steam tons sold in the period to period comparison and higher total company expense as discussed below 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for the steam coal segment was million for both of the years ended december  and average depreciation  depletion and amortization unit costs increased per ton due to lower tons sold in the period to period comparison 
low volatile metallurgical coal segment the low volatile metallurgical coal segment contributed million to total company earnings before income tax for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  
table of contents low volatile metallurgical coal revenue was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was due to the lower average price per ton sold and lower sales volumes of company produced low volatile metallurgical coal sold 
variance percent change produced low vol met tons sold in millions average sales price per low vol met ton sold average operating costs per low vol met ton sold average provision costs per low vol met ton sold average selling  administrative and other costs per low vol met ton sold average depreciation  depletion and amortization costs per low vol met ton sold total costs per low vol met ton sold margin the decrease in average sales price for low volatile metallurgical coal in the year to year comparison reflects lower prices realized due to a downturn in the domestic and international steel business and the deferment of previously negotiated pricing into future periods 
sales of company produced low volatile metallurgical coal decreased in due to a downturn in the domestic and international steel business resulting in reduced demand for low volatile metallurgical coal and the idling of the buchanan mine from march  to august  total costs for the low volatile metallurgical coal segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  a meaningful comparison of unit costs cannot be made because of the low volume of coal produced and sold from the low volatile metallurgical coal segment in  as discussed above 
the impairments in unit costs were related to idling the buchanan mine from march  to august  the unit costs are not representative of the operating mine due to fixed costs being spread over significantly fewer tons 
other coal segment the other coal segment had a loss before tax of million for the year ended december  compared to a loss before income tax for the year ended december  the other coal segment includes purchased coal activities  closed and idle mine costs  and miscellaneous transactions that are directly related to the coal segment 
purchased coal sales consist of revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specification  coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and revenues from processing third party coal in our preparation plants 
the revenues were million for the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the decrease of million in purchased coal revenue was primarily due to a decrease in demand in the year to year comparisons 
freight revenue is the amount billed to customers for transportation costs incurred 
this revenue is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc 
used for the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight revenue has decreased million in primarily due to lower domestic shipments to customers for whom consol energy pays the freight and then passes on the cost to the customer 
freight revenue also decreased due to fewer export sales made to customers whom consol energy pays the ocean going freight and then passes on the cost to the customer 

table of contents miscellaneous other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million decrease consisted of the following items in march  consol energy received notice from its insurance carriers that million would be paid as final settlement of the insurance claim related to the july buchanan mine incident that idled the mine 
the million represented business interruption coverage which was recognized in other income  the coal segment recognized million and the gas segment recognized million 
the final settlement brought the total amount recovered from insurance carriers to million  the maximum allowed per covered event

this transaction resulted in million pre tax gain in other miscellaneous income decreased million in the year to year comparison due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
these decreases were partially offset by the following item in  million of income was recognized related to contracts with certain customers that were unable to take delivery of previously contracted coal tonnage 
these customers agreed to buy out their contracts in order to release them from the requirement of taking delivery of previously committed tons 
no such transactions occurred in other coal segment total costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was due to the following items purchased coal costs decreased million in the year to year comparison 
purchased coal costs consist of expenses from processing third party coal in our preparation plants for blending purposes to meet customer coal specification  cost of coal purchased from third parties and sold directly to our customers and costs related to processing third party coal in our preparation plants 
freight expense decreased million in the year to year comparison 
freight expense is based on weight of coal shipped  negotiated freight rates and method of transportation ie  rail  barge  truck  etc 
used for the customers to which consol energy contractually provides transportation services 
freight expense has decreased primarily due to lower domestic shipments to customers for whom consol energy pays the freight and then passes on the cost to the customer 
freight expense also decreased due to fewer export sales made to customers whom consol energy pays the ocean going freight and then passes on the cost to the customer 
in july  production at the buchanan mine was suspended after several roof falls in previously mined areas damaged some of the ventilation controls inside the mine  requiring a general evacuation of the mine 
in  million of costs related to the buchanan mine event were incurred 
the year ended december  included adjustments related to consol energy agreements to buy out coal sales contracts with several customers in order to release tons committed under lower priced contracts for sale to other customers at higher prices 
the year ended december  included fewer customer buyouts 
the costs for these transactions were million in compared to million in in the year ended december   million of expense was recognized related to contracts with certain customers who were unable to take delivery of previously contracted coal tonnage 
these customers agreed to allow consol energy to sell the released tonnage  but required consol energy to split the incremental sales price over the original contract sales price evenly with them 
the million represents the additional sales price received for the tonnage sold that is owed to the original customer 

table of contents incentive compensation and stock based compensation expense increased million as a result of the company reaching pre determined targets for production  safety and unit costs and additional awards granted 
royalty expense increased million in the year to year comparison as a result of increased average sales prices and increased volumes mined on leased tracts 
other coal segment costs increased million in related to litigation expense recognized in conjunction with the levisa action and the pobst combs action 
this litigation related to depositing water in mine voids of adjacent properties which were leased by consol energy subsidiaries 
other miscellaneous costs increased million in the year to year comparison due to various miscellaneous transactions that occurred throughout both periods  none of which were individually material 
closed and idle mine total costs increased million in the year to year comparison 
approximately million of increased expenses were incurred at mine to remove underground equipment from the mine in preparation of idling and to construct seals to close sections of the underground mine works so that the mine can be maintained in a more efficient manner 
increases were also attributable to the idled shoemaker mine incurring approximately million of additional expenses in related to the continued maintenance of the mine in an idled status 
closed and idle mine total costs also increased million primarily due to changes in the operational status of various other mines between idled and operating  throughout both periods which resulted in higher idled mine costs these increases were offset  in part  by reductions of million related to mine closing  reclamation and water treatment liabilities 
these decreases primarily related to adjustments in engineering estimates of water quality and flows  as well as changes in the credit adjusted risk free interest rates 
in  million of refunds related to black lung excise taxes were recognized 
the refunds related to the emergency economic stabilization act of the essa act which was signed into law on october  the eesa act contained a section that authorized certain coal producers and exporters who had filed a black lung excise tax blet return on or after october   to request a refund of the blet paid on export sales 
the eesa act required the us treasury to refund an amount equal to the blet erroneously paid on export sales in prior years along with interest computed at the statutory rates applicable to overpayments 
consol energy subsequently received approximately million of blet refunds 
approximately million of additional interest income was recognized in to adjust estimated interest on these claims to the amount of interest received

table of contents cbm sales revenues decreased million in the year to year comparison 
the decrease in outside sales was primarily due to lower average sales prices received  offset  in part  by higher volumes of gas sold 
variance percent change produced gas cbm sales volumes in billion cubic feet average cbm sales price per thousand cubic feet sold average cbm lifting costs per thousand cubic feet sold average cbm gathering costs per thousand cubic feet sold average cbm general administrative costs per thousand cubic feet sold average cbm depreciation  depletion and amortization costs per thousand cubic feet sold total cbm costs per thousand cubic feet sold margin sales volumes increased as a result of additional wells coming online from our ongoing drilling program 
the decrease in average sales price is the result of the general market price decreases in the year to year comparison 
the general market price decline was offset  in part  by the various gas swap transactions entered into by consol energy 
these gas swap transactions qualify as financial cash flow hedges that exist parallel to the underlying physical transactions 
these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet of our produced gas sales volumes for the year ended december  at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
in the year ended december   these financial hedges represented approximately billion cubic feet at an average price of per thousand cubic feet 
cbm lifting costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  average cbm lifting costs per unit were per thousand cubic feet in compared to per thousand cubic feet in the decrease in average lifting costs was due to reduced severances taxes primarily due to the reduction in average sales prices in the year ended december  the severance tax decrease also includes an expense reduction attributable to a revised estimate of a pending litigation settlement 
well service costs have also decreased due to lower contract service rig hours needed as a result of less pump maintenance being required in the year ended december  these decreases in unit costs were offset  in part  by an increase related to idling various drilling rigs throughout the company 
some of consol energy s drilling contracts require minimum payments be made to the contracting party when drilling rigs are not being used 
the consol energy drilling program has slowed down pending a change in the economic environment 
these charges resulted in an increase to costs 
cbm gathering costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was attributable to higher volumes produced during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   offset  in part  by lower average unit costs 
average gathering and compression unit costs were per thousand cubic feet in compared to per thousand cubic feet in the decrease in average gathering and compression costs was attributable to lower gob collection charges primarily due to the buchanan longwall being idled throughout a portion of compression expenses decreased primarily due to a reduction in the number of compressors utilized in the southwest pennsylvania operation production field 
due to the slow down in the drilling program in southwest pennsylvania  rented compressors have been returned to more appropriately design the gathering fields to meet existing needs 
these decreases in unit costs were offset by increases in firm transportation costs primarily due to acquiring additional capacity in the southwest pennsylvania operation after december  power and fuel costs also increased due to a power rate increase which occurred after december  also  the increase was due to additional compressors being placed in service after december  along the existing gathering system in the virginia production field in order to flow the increasing gas volumes more efficiently 

table of contents general and administrative costs for the cbm gas segment were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses increased million in the year to year comparison 
the increased general and administrative expense is attributable to the reassignment of certain cnx gas personnel in the fourth quarter of from operational roles to general and administrative oversight functions 
the impact of the increased general and administrative costs was offset  in part  by higher volumes produced in depreciation  depletion and amortization expense was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  production related depreciation  depletion and amortization related to the cbm segment was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in production related depreciation  depletion and amortization was primarily due to increased volumes produced  combined with an increase in the units of production rates for the year to year comparison 
these rates increased due to the higher proportion of capital assets placed in service versus the proportion of proved developed reserve additions 
these rates are generally calculated using the net book value of assets at the end of the previous year divided by either proved or proved developed reserves 
gathering depreciation  depletion and amortization was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  gathering depreciation  depletion and amortization is recorded using the straight line method and increased million in due to assets placed in service after december  conventional segment the conventional segment had a loss before income tax of million for the year ended december  the revenues and costs associated with the conventional gas segment for the year ended december  were insignificant  thus a comparison has not been presented

this segment includes purchased gas activity  gas royalty interest activity  exploration and other costs  other corporate expenses  and miscellaneous operational activity outside of the specific gas segments 
other gas sales volumes are primarily related to production from the chattanooga shale in tennessee 
revenue from this operation was approximately million in total costs related to these other sales were million in the revenues and costs associated with this production for the year ended december  were insignificant 
royalty interest gas sales represent the revenues for the portion of production belonging to royalty interest owners sold by cnx gas on their behalf 
royalty interest gas sales were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in market prices  contractual differences among leases  and the mix of average and index prices used in calculating royalties  contributed to the year to year change

purchased gas volumes sold also reflect the impact of pipeline imbalances 
purchased gas costs were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the lower average cost per thousand cubic feet is due to overall price decreases and contractual differences among customers in the year to year comparison 
variance percent change purchased gas volumes in billion cubic feet average cost price per thousand cubic feet sold exploration and other costs increased million due to the following items variance percent change dry hole and lease expiration costs land and delay rentals exploration total exploration and other costs dry hole and other costs were incurred related to the determination that certain areas where an exploration well was drilled would not be economical to pursue 
the costs for the exploration wells  which were previously capitalized  were expensed 
in  other costs include costs which were previously capitalized related to a lease 
the lease was surrendered due to the properties being widely scattered and not adjacent to any of our existing operating units 
also  costs related to particular permits where management has determined that no drilling will take place have been expensed 
exploration expense increased primarily due to additional land rental expenses and higher geological and geophysical charges in the year to year comparison 
other corporate expenses have increased million due to the following items variance percent change short term incentive compensation contract settlement stock based compensation other total other corporate expenses 
table of contents the short term incentive compensation program is designed to increase compensation to eligible employees when cnx gas reaches predetermined targets for production  unit cost and safety goals 
approximately million of short term incentive compensation was allocated from consol energy 
the allocation is attributable to the april management consolidation which resulted in employees being transferred from cnx gas to consol energy 
the consol energy employees provide substantially all of the management and administrative functions of cnx gas  therefore a representative portion of consol energy s short term incentive compensation is now allocated to cnx gas 
this increase was offset  in part  by lower short term incentive compensation due to fewer cnx gas employees  resulting in a decrease of million  excluding the consol energy allocation 
the year ended december  includes million related to a contract buyout with a driller in order to mitigate idle rig charges in certain areas where drilling is not expected to ramp up in the near term 
no such transactions occurred during stock based compensation expense decreased million in the year to year comparison 
the improvement was related to the cnx gas performance share units being converted to consol energy restricted stock units in the year ended december  contains million of fair value adjustments associated with the exchange offer to convert cnx gas performance share units into consol energy restricted stock units 
miscellaneous other corporate expenses increased million in the year to year comparison primarily due to cease use expenses incurred related to the relocation of cnx gas corporate office and various other transactions that occurred throughout both years  none of which were individually material 
interest expense remained consistent at million in the year to year comparison 
noncontrolling interest noncontrolling interest represents of the earnings impact of a third party which has been determined to be a variable interest entity  in which the consol energy gas segment holds no ownership interest  but is the primary beneficiary 
the consol energy gas segment has been determined to be the primary beneficiary due to guarantees of the third party s bank debt related to their purchase of drilling rigs 
the third party entity provides drilling services primarily to the consol energy gas segment 
consol energy consolidates the entity and then reflects of the impact as noncontrolling interest 
the consolidation does not significantly impact any amounts reflected in the gas segment income statement 
the variance in the noncontrolling interest amounts reflects the third party s variance in earnings in the period to period comparison

on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters 
management believes that the estimates utilized are reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies are materially impacted by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
business combinations at acquisition  consol energy allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values 
significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values  and may include the use of appraisals  consider market quotes for similar transactions  employ discounted cash flow techniques or consider other information consol energy believes relevant 
the finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete  and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts  adjustments are recorded 
any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill which is not amortized to expense 
recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value 
subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation  any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in consolidated statement of operations 
once final  it is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price  even if subsequent events or circumstances prove 
table of contents the original judgments and estimates to be incorrect 
in addition  long lived assets like property and equipment  amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the assumptions and judgments made when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future 
purchase price allocations for all recent acquisitions including the dominion acquisition have been finalized 
other post employment benefits opeb certain subsidiaries of consol energy provide medical and life insurance benefits to retired employees not covered by the coal industry retiree health benefit act of the medical plans contain certain cost sharing and containment features  such as deductibles  coinsurance  health care networks and coordination with medicare 
for salaried employees hired before january   the eligibility requirement is either age with years of service or age with years of service 
also  salaried employees and retirees contribute a target of of the medical plan operating costs 
contributions may be higher  dependent on either years of service or a combination of age and years of service at retirement 
prospective annual cost increases of up to will be shared by consol energy and the participants based on their age and years of service at retirement 
annual cost increases in excess of will be the responsibility of the participants 
any salaried or non represented hourly employees that were hired or rehired effective january  or later will not become eligible for retiree health benefits 
in lieu of traditional retiree health coverage  if certain eligibility requirements are met  these employees will receive a retiree medical spending allowance of  per year for each year of service at retirement 
newly employed inexperienced employees represented by the united mine workers of america umwa  hired after january   will not be eligible to receive retiree benefits 
in lieu of these benefits  these employees will receive a defined contribution benefit of per each hour worked 
after our review  various actuarial assumptions  including discount rate  expected trend in health care costs  average remaining service period  average remaining life expectancy  per capita costs and participation level in each future year are used by our independent actuary to estimate the cost and benefit obligations for our retiree health plans 
most assumptions used in have not differed materially from the prior year 
mortality tables have been updated for salary employees to project future mortality improvements for plan participants and spouses 
mortality tables for hourly workers will continue to use the generational experience mortality table based upon the united mine workers of america trust study 
expected trends in future health care cost assumptions have not changed since the prior year 
the initial expected trend in health care costs at this year s measurement date is with an ultimate trend rate of reached in a decrease in the health care trend rate would decrease interest and service cost for by approximately million 
a increase in the health care trend rate would increase the interest and service cost by approximately million 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date 
the discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated aa by moody s as of the measurement date 
all future post employment benefit expected payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of december  the appropriate discount rate was then selected from resulting discounted cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased net periodic postretirement benefit costs by approximately million 
deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and medical cost inflation differing from expectations in prior years 
changes to interest rates for the rates of returns on instruments that could be used to settle the actuarially determined plan obligations introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active salary and non represented employees to their assumed retirement age 
at december  the average remaining service period is approximately years for our non represented plans 
accumulated actuarial gains or losses in excess of a pre established corridor are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected remaining life of our retired umwa population 
the average remaining service period of this population is not used for amortization 
table of contents purposes because the majority of the umwa population of our plan is retired 
at december   the average remaining life expectancy of our retired umwa population used to calculate the following year s expense is approximately years 
the weighted average per capita costs used to value the december  other postretirement benefit liability was less than expected based on our trend assumption 
if the actual change in per capita cost of medical services or other postretirement benefits are significantly greater or less than the projected trend rates  the per capita cost assumption would need to be adjusted  which could have a significant effect on the costs and liabilities recorded in the financial statements 
significant increases in health and prescription drug costs for represented hourly retirees could have a material adverse effect on consol energy s operating cash flow 
however  the effect on consol energy s cash flow from operations for salaried employees is limited to approximately of the previous year s medical cost for salaried employees due to the cost sharing provision in the benefit plan 
the opeb liability at december  reflects an increase of approximately million due to the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca reform legislation  in particular  the estimated impact of the potential excise tax beginning in a corresponding increase in other comprehensive loss was also recognized 
the estimated increase in the liability was calculated using the following assumptions testing pre medicare and medicare covered retirees on a combined basis  assuming individual participates have an average claim cost and future healthcare trend assumptions equal to those used in the year end valuation  assuming the tax threshold amount to increase for inflation in later years 
these assumptions may change once additional guidance becomes available 
the estimated liability recognized in the december  financial statements was billion 
this amount includes a liability of million related to the past service earned by the employees that were retained in the dominion acquisition 
for the year ended december   we paid approximately million for other postretirement benefits  all of which were paid from operating cash flow 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  consol energy does not expect to contribute to the other postretirement plan in we intend to pay benefit claims as they are due 
salaried pensions consol energy has non contributory defined benefit retirement plans covering substantially all employees not covered by multi employer plans 
the benefits for these plans are based primarily on years of service and employee s pay near retirement 
consol energy s salaried plan allows for lump sum distributions of benefits earned up until december   at the employees election 
the restoration plan was frozen effective december  and was replaced prospectively with the consol energy supplemental retirement plan 
consol energy s restoration plan allows only for lump sum distributions earned up until december  effective september   the supplemental retirement plan was amended to include employees of cnx gas 
in march of  the cnx gas defined benefit retirement plan was merged into the consol energy s non contributory defined benefit retirement plan 
at the time  the change did not impact the benefits for employees of cnx gas 
however  during an amendment was adopted to recognize past service at cnx gas to current employees of cnx gas who opted out of the plan for additional company contributions into their defined contribution plan and extend coverage to employees previously not eligible to participate in this plan 
our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated retirement obligation based on assumptions including rates of compensation  mortality rates  retirement age and interest rates 
for the year ended december   compensation increases are assumed to range from to depending on age and job classification 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date 
the discount rate is 
table of contents determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated aa by moody s as of the measurement date 
all expected benefit payments from the consol energy retirement plan were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of december  the appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected for the resulting discounted pension cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased the net periodic pension cost by million 
deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rate and earnings on assets differing from expectations 
at december  the average remaining service period is approximately years 
changes to any of these assumptions introduce substantial volatility to our costs 
the market related asset value is derived by taking the cost value of assets as of december  and multiplying it by the average month ratio of the market value of assets to the cost value of assets 
consol energy s pension plan weighted average asset allocations at december  consisted of equity securities and debt securities 
the estimated liability recognized in the december  financial statements was million 
for the year ended december   we contributed approximately million to defined benefit retirement plans other than multi employer plans trust and to other pension benefits 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are partially funded at december  consol energy intends to contribute an amount that will avoid benefit restrictions for the following plan year 
workers compensation and coal workers pneumoconiosis workers compensation is a system by which individuals who sustain employment related physical injuries or some type of occupational diseases are compensated for their disabilities  medical costs  and on some occasions  for the costs of their rehabilitation 
workers compensation will also compensate the survivors of workers who suffer employment related deaths 
the workers compensation laws are administered by state agencies with each state having its own set of rules and regulations regarding compensation that is owed to an employee that is injured in the course of employment 
consol energy records an actuarially calculated liability  which is determined using various assumptions  including discount rate  future healthcare cost trends  benefit duration and recurrence of injuries 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date 
the discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated aa by moody s as of the measurement date 
all future workers compensation expected benefit payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve as of december  the appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected from the resulting discounted workers compensation cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased the workers compensation expense cost by million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased the workers compensation expense by million 
deferred gains and losses are primarily due to historical changes in the discount rates  several years of favorable claims experience  various favorable state legislation changes and an overall lower incident rate than our assumptions 
accumulated actuarial gains or losses are amortized on a straight line basis over the expected future service of active employees that are eligible to file a future workers compensation claim 
at december   the average remaining service period is approximately years 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december  was approximately million 
consol energy s policy has been to provide for workers compensation benefits from operating cash flow 
for the year ended december   we made payments for workers compensation benefits and other related fees of approximately million  all of which was paid from operating cash flow 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  
table of contents consol energy is responsible under the federal coal mine health and safety act of  as amended  for medical and disability benefits to employees and their dependents resulting from occurrences of coal workers pneumoconiosis disease 
consol energy is also responsible under various state statutes for pneumoconiosis benefits 
after our review  our independent actuaries calculate the actuarial present value of the estimated pneumoconiosis obligation based on assumptions regarding disability incidence  medical costs  mortality  death benefits  dependents and discount rates 
the discount rate is determined each year at the measurement date 
the discount rate is determined by utilizing a corporate yield curve model developed from corporate bond data using only bonds rated aa by moody s as of the measurement date 
all future coal workers pneumoconiosis expected benefit payments were discounted using a spot rate yield curve at december  the appropriate equivalent discount rate was then selected from the resulting discounted coal workers pneumoconiosis cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  the discount rate used to calculate the period end liability and the following year s expense was and  respectively 
a increase in the discount rate would have decreased coal workers pneumoconiosis expense by million 
a decrease in the discount rate would have increased coal workers pneumoconiosis by million 
actuarial gains associated with coal workers pneumoconiosis have resulted from numerous legislative changes over many years which have resulted in lower approval rates for filed claims than our assumptions originally reflected 
actuarial gains have also resulted from lower incident rates and lower severity of claims filed than our assumptions originally reflected 
the estimated liability recognized in the financial statements at december  was million 
for the year ended december   we paid coal workers pneumoconiosis benefits of approximately million  all of which was paid from operating cash flow 
our obligations with respect to these liabilities are unfunded at december  the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca impacts consol energy pneumoconiosis liabilities in that future claims will qualify for payment at a greater rate than has occurred in the past 
all consol energy historical claim data and data from the department of labor database was gathered and analyzed to determine the impact of the ppaca 
the analysis resulted in an adjustment to the pre ppaca assumptions which resulted in a million reduction to the liability 
the impact of the ppaca  including the changes to the legal criteria used to assess and award claims and changes to the law that grant death benefits  regardless of the cause of death  to surviving dependants of miners who have been receiving pneumoconiosis benefits  resulted in an increase of million to the liability 
these adjustments were treated as adjustments to the actuarial loss and are included in the december  liabilities 
reclamation  mine closure and gas well closing obligations the surface mining control and reclamation act established operational  reclamation and closure standards for all aspects of surface mining as well as most aspects of deep mining 
consol energy accrues for the costs of current mine disturbance and final mine and gas well closure  including the cost of treating mine water discharge where necessary 
estimates of our total reclamation  mine closing liabilities  and gas well closing which are based upon permit requirements and consol energy engineering expertise related to these requirements  including the current portion  were approximately million at december  this liability is reviewed annually  or when events and circumstances indicate an adjustment is necessary  by consol energy management and engineers 
the estimated liability can significantly change if actual costs vary from assumptions or if governmental regulations change significantly 
accounting for asset retirement obligations requires that the fair value of an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the present value of the estimated asset retirement costs is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
asset retirement obligations primarily relate to the closure of mines and gas wells and the reclamation of land upon exhaustion of coal and gas reserves 
changes in the variables used to calculate the liabilities can have a significant effect on the mine closing  reclamation and gas well closing liabilities 
the amounts of assets and liabilities recorded are dependent upon a number of variables  including the estimated future retirement costs  estimated proven reserves  assumptions involving profit margins  inflation rates  and the assumed credit adjusted risk free interest rate 

table of contents accounting for asset retirement obligations also requires depreciation of the capitalized asset retirement cost and accretion of the asset retirement obligation over time 
the depreciation will generally be determined on a units of production basis  whereas the accretion to be recognized will escalate over the life of the producing assets  typically as production declines 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
all available evidence  both positive and negative  must be considered in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   consol energy has deferred tax assets in excess of deferred tax liabilities of approximately million 
the deferred tax assets are evaluated periodically to determine if a valuation allowance is necessary 
deferred tax valuation allowances increased million in the year ended december  due to various transactions that occurred throughout  none of which were individually material 
valuation allowances on certain net operating loss carry forwards were not released during the year due to negative evidence outweighing positive evidence indicating that these benefits will not be utilized in future years 
consol energy continues to report a deferred tax asset of approximately million relating to its state net operating loss carry forwards subject to a full valuation allowance 
a review of positive and negative evidence regarding these benefits  primarily the history of financial and tax losses on a separate company basis  concluded that a full valuation allowance was warranted 
the net operating loss carry forwards expire at various times from to a valuation allowance of million has also been recorded against the state deferred tax asset attributable to future tax deductible differences for certain subsidiaries with histories of financial and tax losses 
management will continue to assess the realization of deferred tax assets attributable to state net operating loss carry forwards and future tax deductible differences based upon updated income forecast data and the feasibility of future tax planning strategies  and may record adjustments to valuation allowances against these deferred tax assets in future periods that could materially impact net income 
consol energy evaluates all tax positions taken on the state and federal tax filings to determine if the position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
for positions that meet the more likely than not to be sustained criteria  an evaluation to determine the largest amount of benefit  determined on a cumulative probability basis that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement is determined 
a previously recognized tax position is derecognized when it is subsequently determined that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold to be sustained 
the evaluation of the sustainability of a tax position and the probable amount that is more likely than not is based on judgment  historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates  that are not readily apparent from other sources  form the basis for recognizing an uncertain tax liability 
actual results could differ from those estimates upon subsequent resolution of identified matters 
estimates of our uncertain tax liabilities  including interest and the current portion  were approximately million at december  stock based compensation as of december   we have issued four types of share based payment awards options  restricted stock units  performance stock options and performance share units 
the black scholes option pricing model is used to determine fair value of stock options at the grant date 
various inputs are utilized in the black scholes pricing model  such as stock price on measurement date  exercise price defined in the award  expected dividend yield based on historical trend of dividend payouts  risk free interest rate based on a zero coupon treasury bond rate  
table of contents expected term based on historical grant and exercise behavior  and expected volatility based on historic and implied stock price volatility of consol energy stock and public peer group stock 
these factors can significantly impact the value of stock options expense recognized over the requisite service period of option holders 
the fair value of each restricted stock unit awarded is equivalent to the closing market price of a share of our company s stock on the date of the grant 
the fair value of each performance share unit is determined by the underlying share price of our company stock on the date of the grant and management s estimate of the probability that the performance conditions required for vesting will be achieved 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note stock based compensation in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item in this form k for more information 
contingencies consol energy is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
this estimate has been developed in consultation with legal counsel involved in the defense of these matters and is based upon an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the outcome of these proceedings 
see note commitments and contingent liabilities in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements in item in this form k for further discussion 
successful efforts accounting we use the successful efforts method to account for our gas exploration and production activities 
under this method  cost of property acquisitions  successful exploratory wells  development wells and related support equipment and facilities are capitalized 
costs of unsuccessful exploratory or development wells are expensed when such wells are determined to be non productive  or if the determination cannot be made after finding sufficient quantities of reserves to continue evaluating the viability of the project 
we use this accounting policy instead of the full cost method because it provides a more timely accounting of the success or failure of our gas exploration and production activities 
derivative instruments consol energy enters into financial derivative instruments to manage exposure to natural gas and oil price volatility 
we measure every derivative instrument at fair value and record them on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability 
changes in fair value of derivatives are recorded currently in earnings unless special hedge accounting criteria are met 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the changes in fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are recorded in earnings 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the effective portions of changes in fair value of the derivative are reported in other comprehensive income or loss and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods which the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portions of hedges are recognized in earnings in the current year 
consol energy currently utilizes only cash flow hedges that are considered highly effective 
consol energy formally assesses  both at inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  whether each derivative is highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedge item 
if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  consol energy will discontinue hedge accounting prospectively 

table of contents coal and gas reserve values there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and values of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves  including many factors beyond our control 
as a result  estimates of economically recoverable coal and gas reserves are by their nature uncertain 
information about our reserves consists of estimates based on engineering  economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our staff 
our coal reserves are periodically reviewed by an independent third party consultant 
our gas reserves have been reviewed by independent experts each year 
some of the factors and assumptions which impact economically recoverable reserve estimates include geological conditions  historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulations and taxes by governmental agencies  assumptions governing future prices  and future operating costs 
each of these factors may in fact vary considerably from the assumptions used in estimating reserves 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of coal and gas attributable to a particular group of properties  and classifications of these reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of future net cash flows  may vary substantially 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and these variances may be material 
see risk factors in item a of this report for a discussion of the uncertainties in estimating our reserves
