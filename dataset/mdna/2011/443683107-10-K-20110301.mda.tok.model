deposits 
we offer a variety of deposit accounts having a range of interest rates and terms 
we currently offer passbook and statement savings accounts  interest bearing transaction accounts  checking accounts  money market accounts and time deposits 
we also offer ira accounts and qualified retirement plans 
deposit flows are influenced significantly by general and local economic conditions  changes in prevailing market interest rates  pricing of deposits and competition 
in determining our deposit rates  we consider local competition  us treasury securities offerings and the rates charged on other sources of funds 
our deposits are primarily obtained from market areas surrounding our branch offices 
we also open deposit accounts through the internet for customers throughout the united states 
we rely primarily on paying competitive rates  providing strong customer service and maintaining long standing relationships with customers to attract and retain these deposits 
we do not use brokers to obtain deposits 
during  we opened new branches 
our most direct competition for deposits comes from commercial banks  savings banks  savings and loan associations and credit unions 
there are large money center and regional financial institutions operating throughout our market area  and we also face strong competition from other community based financial institutions 
in response to the economic recession  we believe that households during increased their personal savings and customers sought insured bank deposit products as an alternative to investments such as equity securities and bonds 
we believe these factors contributed to our deposit growth 
we grew our deposits by billion in and by only million in we lowered our deposit rates in to slow our deposit growth from the levels since the low yields that are available to us for mortgage related assets and investment securities have made a growth strategy less prudent until market conditions improve 
total deposits increased million  or  during due primarily to a billion increase in our money market accounts and a million increase in our interest bearing transaction accounts and savings accounts 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in our time deposits 
total core deposits defined as non time deposit accounts represented approximately of total deposits as of december  compared with as of december  this increase is due to the growth in our money market accounts as a result of our favorable rates as compared to our competitors 
the aggregate balance in our time deposit accounts was billion as of december  compared with billion as of december  time deposits with remaining maturities of less than one year amounted to billion at december  compared with billion at december  these time deposits are scheduled to mature as follows billion with an average cost of in the first quarter of  billion with an average cost of in the second quarter of  billion with an average cost of in the third quarter of and billion with an average cost of in the fourth quarter of based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy  we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or as transfers to other deposit products at the prevailing rate

we have entered into agreements with selected brokers and the fhlb to repurchase securities sold to these parties 
these agreements are recorded as financing transactions as we have maintained effective control over the transferred securities 
the dollar amount of the securities underlying the agreements continues to be carried in our securities portfolio 
the obligations to repurchase the securities are reported as a liability in the consolidated statements of financial condition 
the securities underlying the agreements are delivered to the party with whom each transaction is executed 
they agree to resell to us the same securities at the maturity or put date of the agreement 
we retain the right of substitution of the underlying securities throughout the terms of the agreements 
we have also obtained advances from the fhlb  which are generally secured by a blanket lien against our mortgage portfolio 
borrowings with the fhlb are generally limited to approximately twenty times the amount of fhlb stock owned 
borrowed funds at december are summarized as follows weighted weighted average average principal rate principal rate dollars in thousands securities sold under agreements to repurchase fhlb other brokers total securities sold under agreements to repurchase advances from the fhlb total borrowed funds accrued interest payable

as a result  if interest rates were to decrease or stay at current levels  these borrowings would probably not be put back to us and our average cost of existing borrowings would not decrease even as market interest rates decrease 
conversely  if interest rates increase above the market interest rate for similar borrowings  these borrowings would likely be put back to us at their next put date and our cost to replace these borrowings would increase 
these put features are generally quarterly  after an initial no put period of three months to five years from the date of borrowing 
we believe  given current market conditions  that the likelihood that a significant portion of these borrowings would be put back to us will not increase substantially unless interest rates were to increase by at least basis points 
our borrowings have traditionally consisted of structured putable borrowings with ten year final maturities and initial no put periods of one to five years 
we have used this type of borrowing primarily to fund our loan growth because they have a longer duration than shorter term non putable borrowings and have a slightly lower cost than a non putable borrowing with a maturity date similar to the initial put date of the putable borrowing 
we did not enter into any new repurchase agreements during since market interest rates have remained very low for an extended period of time  we have not had any lenders put borrowings back to us 
as a result  many of our borrowings have become putable within three months 
to better manage our liquidity and reduce the level of interest rate risk posed by this type of borrowing  we began to modify these borrowings in to extend or eliminate the put dates 
during  we modified billion of borrowings to extend the call dates of the borrowings by between three and five years 
we are examining various strategies to position our balance sheet for the future as market conditions change and allow for more profitable growth 
as a result  we expect to further restructure a portion our funding mix 
the restructuring may include the continued modification of putable borrowings to extend or eliminate the put dates  the extinguishment of certain borrowings  the refinancing of certain borrowings or a combination of these actions 
the fair value of our borrowings  which is generally the value at which borrowings are extinguished  was approximately of carrying value at december  any restructuring could result in a decrease in the size of the balance sheet and a material charge to earnings

regulation of hudson city savings bank and hudson city bancorp general hudson city savings has been a federally chartered savings bank since january  when it converted from a new jersey chartered savings bank 
its deposit accounts are insured up to applicable limits by the fdic under the deposit insurance fund dif 
under its charter  hudson city savings is subject to extensive regulation  examination and supervision by the ots as its chartering agency  and by the fdic as the deposit insurer 
hudson city bancorp is a unitary savings and loan holding company regulated  examined and supervised by the ots 
each of hudson city bancorp and hudson city savings must file reports with the ots concerning its activities and financial condition  and must obtain regulatory approval from the ots prior to entering into certain transactions  such as mergers with  or acquisitions of  other depository institutions 
the ots will conduct periodic examinations to assess hudson city bancorp s and hudson city savings compliance with various regulatory requirements 
the ots has primary enforcement responsibility over federally chartered savings banks and has substantial discretion to impose enforcement action on an institution that fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  particularly with respect to its capital requirements 
in addition  the fdic has the authority to recommend to the director of the ots that enforcement action be taken with respect to a particular federally chartered savings bank and  if action is not taken by the director  the fdic has authority to take such action under certain circumstances 
this regulation and supervision establishes a comprehensive framework of activities in which a federal savings bank can engage and is intended primarily for the protection of the dif and depositors 
the regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
any change in such laws and regulations including laws concerning taxes  banking  securities  accounting and insurance  whether by the otc  fdic or through legislation  could have a material adverse impact on hudson city bancorp and hudson city savings and their operations and shareholders 
regulatory reform legislation 
on july   president obama signed into law the reform act 
as a result of the reform act  on july   unless the secretary of the treasury opts to delay such date for up to an additional six months the designated transfer date  the ots will be effectively merged into the occ  with the occ assuming all functions and authority from the ots relating to federally chartered savings banks  and the frb assuming all functions and authority from the ots relating to savings and loan holding companies 
in addition  the reform act created a new consumer financial protection bureau the bureau which will operate as an independent agency within the federal reserve board 
the bureau will assume responsibility for the implementation of the federal financial consumer protection and fair lending laws and regulations  a function currently assigned to prudential regulators  and will have authority to impose new requirements 
the reform act also significantly rolls back the federal preemption of state consumer protection laws that is currently enjoyed by federal savings associations and national banks by requiring that a state consumer financial law prevent or significantly interfere with the exercise of a federal savings association s or national bank s powers before it can be preempted  mandating that any preemption decision be made on a case by case basis rather than a blanket rule and ending the applicability of preemption to subsidiaries and affiliates 
table of contents of federal savings associations and national banks 
as a result  we may now be subject to state consumer protection laws in each state where we do business  and those laws may be interpreted and enforced differently in different states 
in addition  the reform act includes provisions  subject to further rulemaking by the agencies  that may affect our future operations  including provisions that create minimum standards for the origination of mortgages  restrict proprietary trading by banking entities  restrict the sponsorship and investment in hedge funds and private equity funds by banking entities and that remove certain obstacles to the conversion of savings associations to national banks 
we will not be able to determine the impact of these provisions until final rules are promulgated to implement these provisions and other regulatory guidance is provided interpreting these provisions 
federally chartered savings bank regulation activity powers 
hudson city savings derives its lending  investment and other activity powers primarily from the home owners loan act  as amended  commonly referred to as hola  and the regulations of the ots thereunder 
under these laws and regulations  federal savings banks  including hudson city savings  generally may invest in real estate mortgages  consumer and commercial loans  certain types of debt securities and certain other assets 
hudson city savings may also establish service corporations that may engage in activities not otherwise permissible for hudson city savings  including certain real estate equity investments and securities and insurance brokerage activities 
these investment powers are subject to various limitations  including a prohibition against the acquisition of any corporate debt security that is not rated in one of the four highest rating categories  a limit of of an association s capital on the aggregate amount of loans secured by non residential real estate property  a limit of of an association s assets on commercial loans  with the amount of commercial loans in excess of of assets being limited to small business loans  a limit of of an association s assets on the aggregate amount of consumer loans and acquisitions of certain debt securities  a limit of of assets on non conforming loans loans in excess of the specific limitations of hola  and a limit of the greater of of assets or an association s capital on certain construction loans made for the purpose of financing what is or is expected to become residential property 
capital requirements 
the ots capital regulations require federally chartered savings banks to meet three minimum capital ratios a tangible capital ratio  a if the savings bank received the highest rating on its most recent examination leverage core capital ratio and an total risk based capital ratio 
in assessing an institution s capital adequacy  the ots takes into consideration not only these numeric factors but also qualitative factors as well  and has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions where necessary 
hudson city savings  as a matter of prudent management  targets as its goal the maintenance of capital ratios which exceed these minimum requirements and that are consistent with hudson city savings risk profile 
generally  under the agencies existing risk based and leverage capital rules  banks  bank holding companies and savings associations collectively  banking organizations are required to deduct certain assets from tier capital  and though a banking organization is permitted to net any associated deferred tax liability against some of such assets prior to making the deduction from tier capital  such netting generally is not permitted for goodwill and other intangible assets arising from a taxable business combination 
in these cases  the full or gross carrying amount of the asset is deducted 
however  banking organizations may reduce the amount of goodwill arising from a taxable business combination that they may deduct from tier capital by the amount of any deferred tax liability associated with that goodwill 
we have no deferred tax liabilities associated with goodwill and  as a result  the full amount of our goodwill is deducted from tier capital 

table of contents for banking organizations that elect to apply this rule  the amount of goodwill deducted from tier capital would reflect the maximum exposure to loss in the event that the entire amount of goodwill is impaired or derecognized for financial reporting purposes 
a banking organization that reduces the amount of goodwill deducted from tier capital by the amount of the deferred tax liability is not permitted to net this deferred tax liability against deferred tax assets when determining regulatory capital limitations on deferred tax assets 
at december   hudson city savings exceeded each of the applicable capital requirements as shown in the following table ots requirements minimum capital for classification as bank actual adequacy well capitalized amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio dollars in thousands december  tangible capital   n a n a leverage core capital total risk based capital december  tangible capital   n a n a leverage core capital total risk based capital the reform act requires the agencies to establish consolidated risk based and leverage capital requirements for insured depository institutions  depository institution holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies 
these requirements must be no less than those to which insured depository institutions are currently subject to 
as a result  in july  we will become subject to consolidated capital requirements which we have not been subject to previously 
in addition  pursuant to the reform act  hudson city bancorp will be required to serve as a source of strength of hudson city savings 
on september   the basel committee adopted the basel iii capital rules 
these rules  which will be phased in over a period of years  set new standards for common equity  tier and total capital  determined on a risk weighted basis 
the impact on hudson city savings and the company of the reform act requirements and the basel iii rules cannot be determined at this time 
interest rate risk 
the ots monitors the irr of individual institutions through the ots requirements for irr management  the ability of the ots to impose individual minimum capital requirements on institutions that exhibit a high degree of irr  and the requirements of thrift bulletin a  which provides guidance on the management of irr and the responsibility of boards of directors in that area 
the ots continues to monitor the irr of individual institutions through analysis of the change in net portfolio value  or npv 
npv is defined as the net present value of the expected future cash flows of an entity s assets and liabilities and  therefore  hypothetically represents the value of an institution s net worth 
the ots has also used this npv analysis as part of its evaluation of certain applications or notices submitted by thrift institutions 
the ots  through its general oversight of the safety and soundness of savings associations  retains the right to impose minimum capital requirements on individual institutions to the extent the institution is not in compliance with certain written guidelines established by the ots regarding npv analysis 
in january  the agencies released an advisory on interest rate risk management the irr advisory to remind institutions of the supervisory expectations regarding sound practices for managing irr 
while some degree of irr is inherent in the business of banking  the agencies expect institutions to have sound risk 
table of contents management practices in place to measure  monitor and control irr exposures  and irr management should be an integral component of an institution s risk management infrastructure 
the agencies expect all institutions to manage their irr exposures using processes and systems commensurate with their earnings and capital levels  complexity  business model  risk profile and scope of operations  and the irr advisory reiterates the importance of effective corporate governance  policies and procedures  risk measuring and monitoring systems  stress testing  and internal controls related to the irr exposures of institutions 
the irr advisory encourages institutions to use a variety of techniques to measure irr exposure  including simple maturity gap analysis  income measurement and valuation measurement for assessing the impact of changes in market rates  as well as simulation modeling to measure irr exposure 
institutions are encouraged to use the full complement of analytical capabilities of their irr simulation models 
the irr advisory also reminds institutions that stress testing  which includes both scenario and sensitivity analysis  is an integral component of irr management 
the irr advisory indicates that institutions should regularly assess irr exposures beyond typical industry conventions  including changes in rates of greater magnitude eg  up and down and basis points  as compared to up and down basis points  which has been the general practice across different tenors to reflect changing slopes and twists of the yield curve 
the irr advisory emphasizes that effective irr management not only involves the identification and measurement of irr  but also provides for appropriate actions to control this risk 
the adequacy and effectiveness of an institution s irr management process and the level of its irr exposure are critical factors in the agencies evaluation of an institution s sensitivity to changes in interest rates and capital adequacy 
the bank is currently out of compliance with the board established limits regarding its npv calculations 
in addition  we believe our interest rate risk position would be considered significant based on the ots written guidelines regarding npv analysis 
we are working to develop strategies to bring the bank into compliance with our board approved exposure limits and to reduce our interest rate risk exposure to be consistent with the ots guidelines 
to address our interest rate risk exposure  we are studying the feasibility of restructuring our borrowings to further strengthen our balance sheet and improve net interest margin going forward 
the restructuring may include the modification of putable borrowings to extend or eliminate the put dates  the extinguishment of certain borrowings  the refinancing of borrowings or a combination of these actions 
the fair value of our borrowings  which is generally the value at which borrowings are extinguished  was approximately of carrying value at december  any restructuring could result in a decrease in the size of the balance sheet and a material charge to earnings 
as a result of the enhanced regulatory scrutiny  our interest rate risk position  our funding concentration in structured borrowings  our significant growth since and certain regulatory compliance matters  we expect to become subject to an informal regulatory enforcement action in the form of a memorandum of understanding mou with the ots 
under an mou  the bank may be required to reduce its level of interest rate risk and funding concentration  adopt certain policies and procedures to achieve such reductions and address certain compliance matters 
in addition  the ots has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions  impose restrictions on distributions from the bank to the company and restrict the ability of the company to pay dividends to its shareholders  to repurchase stock and to incur debt 
we have the intention and the ability to comply with an mou 
safety and soundness standards 
pursuant to the requirements of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia  as amended by the riegle community development and regulatory improvement act of  each federal banking agency  including the ots  has adopted guidelines establishing general standards relating to internal controls  information and internal audit systems  loan documentation  credit underwriting  interest rate exposure  asset growth  asset quality  earnings and compensation  fees and benefits 
in general  the guidelines require  among other things  appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risks and exposures specified in the guidelines 
the guidelines prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer  employee  director  or principal shareholder 
in addition  the ots adopted regulations to require a savings bank that is given notice by the ots that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan to the ots 
if  after being so notified  a savings bank fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an accepted compliance plan  the ots may issue an order directing corrective and other actions of the types to which a significantly undercapitalized institution is subject under the prompt corrective action provisions of fdicia 
if a savings bank fails to comply with such an order  the ots may seek to enforce such an order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil monetary penalties 
prompt corrective action 
fdicia also established a system of prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions 
under this system  the bank regulators are required to take certain  and authorized to take other  supervisory actions against undercapitalized institutions  based upon five categories of capitalization which fdicia created well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the severity of the action authorized or required to be taken under the prompt corrective action regulations increases as a bank s capital decreases within the three undercapitalized categories 
all banks are prohibited from paying dividends or other capital distributions or paying management fees to any controlling person if  following such distribution  the bank would be undercapitalized 
the ots is required to monitor closely the condition of an undercapitalized bank and to restrict the growth of its assets 

table of contents an undercapitalized bank is required to file a capital restoration plan within days of the date the bank receives notices that it is within any of the three undercapitalized categories  and the plan must be guaranteed by every parent holding company 
the aggregate liability of a parent holding company is limited to the lesser of an amount equal to five percent of the bank s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized  and the amount that is necessary or would have been necessary to bring the bank into compliance with all capital standards applicable with respect to such bank as of the time it fails to comply with the plan 
if a bank fails to submit an acceptable plan  it is treated as if it were significantly undercapitalized 
banks that are significantly or critically undercapitalized are subject to a wider range of regulatory requirements and restrictions 
under the ots regulations  generally  a federally chartered savings bank is treated as well capitalized if its total risk based capital ratio is or greater  its tier risk based capital ratio is or greater  and its leverage ratio is or greater  and it is not subject to any order or directive by the ots to meet a specific capital level 
as of december   hudson city savings met the applicable requirements to be considered well capitalized 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions with respect to undercapitalized institutions  insured banks and their holding companies may be subject to potential enforcement actions by their regulators for unsafe and unsound practices in conducting their business or for violations of law or regulation  including the filing of a false or misleading regulatory report 
enforcement actions under this authority may include the issuance of cease and desist orders  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  formal and informal agreements  or removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliates parties generally bank insiders 
further  the ots may bring an enforcement action against a bank holding company either to address undercapitalization in the holding company or to require the holding company to take measures to remediate undercapitalization or other safety and soundness concerns in a bank subsidiary 
insurance activities 
hudson city savings is generally permitted to engage in certain activities through its subsidiaries 
however  the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations prohibiting depository institutions from conditioning the extension of credit to individuals upon either the purchase of an insurance product or annuity or an agreement by the consumer not to purchase an insurance product or annuity from an entity that is not affiliated with the depository institution 
the regulations also require prior disclosure of this prohibition to potential insurance product or annuity customers 
deposit insurance 
the fdic merged the bif and the savings association insurance fund to form the dif on march  hudson city savings is a member of the dif and pays its deposit insurance assessments to the dif 
under the deposit insurance funds act of funds act  the assessment base for the payments on the bonds fico bonds issued in the late s by the financing corporation to recapitalize the now defunct federal savings and loan insurance corporation was expanded to include  beginning january   the deposits of bif insured institutions  such as hudson city savings 
our total expense for the assessment for the fico payments was million in under the federal deposit insurance act  as amended fdia  the fdic may terminate the insurance of an institution s deposits upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law  regulation  rule  order or condition imposed by the fdic 
the management of hudson city savings does not know of any practice  condition or violation that might lead to termination of deposit insurance 
as a result of the recent failures of a number of banks and thrifts  there has been a significant increase in the loss provisions of the dif 
this has resulted in a decline in the dif reserve ratio  which the fdic established as of estimated insured deposits in january of because the dif reserve ratio declined below the fdic was required to establish a restoration plan to restore the reserve ratio to within five years 
in order to restore the reserve ratio to  the fdic increased risk based assessment rates uniformly by basis points annualized during the first quarter of thereafter  the fdic further increased the initial base assessment rates  beginning with the second quarter of  depending on an institution s risk category  with adjustments resulting in increased assessment rates for institutions with a significant reliance on secured liabilities and brokered deposits 
in addition  in may of the fdic extended the period of the restoration plan from five to eight years due to extraordinary circumstances and imposed a five basis point special assessment on each insured depository institution s assets minus tier capital as of june  the special 
table of contents assessment was million for hudson city and was collected on september  in december  the fdic amended its regulations to increase the designated reserve ratio of the dif from to of estimated insured deposits of the dif effective january  the fdic is authorized to change the assessment rates as necessary  subject to certain limitations  to maintain the designated reserve ratio 
the reform act increased the minimum target reserve ratio from of estimated insured deposits to of estimated insured deposits 
the fdic must seek to achieve the ratio by september  insured institutions with assets of billion or more are required to fund the increase 
the reform act eliminated the maximum fund ratio  instead leaving it to the discretion of the fdic 
in accordance with the reform act  on february   the fdic adopted a final rule that redefines the assessment base for deposit insurance assessments as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity  rather than on deposit bases  and adopts a new assessment rate schedule  as well as alternative rate schedules that become effective when the reserve ratio reaches certain levels 
the final rule also makes conforming changes to the unsecured debt and brokered deposit adjustments to assessment rates  eliminates the secured liability adjustment and creates a new assessment rate adjustment for unsecured debt held that is issued by another insured depository institution 
the new rate schedule and other revisions to the assessment rules become effective april  and will be used to calculate our june  invoices for assessments due september  as revised by the final rule  the initial base assessment rates for institutions with less than billion in assets will range from five to nine basis points for risk category i institutions and are fourteen basis points for risk category ii institutions  twenty three basis points for risk category iii institutions and thirty five basis points for risk category iv institutions 
in addition  for large insured depository institutions  generally defined as those with at least billion in total assets  such as hudson city  the final rule also eliminates risk categories and the use of long term debt issuer ratings when calculating the initial base assessment rates and combines regulatory ratings  known as camels ratings  and financial measures into two scorecards  one for most large insured depository institutions and another for highly complex insured depository institutions  to calculate assessment rates 
a highly complex institution is generally defined as an insured depository institution with more than billion in total assets that is controlled by a parent company with more than billion in total assets 
each scorecard would have two components a performance score and loss severity score  which will be combined and converted to an initial assessment rate 
the fdic will have the ability to adjust a large or highly complex insured depository institution s total score by a maximum of points up or down based upon significant risk factors that are not captured by the scorecard 
the fdic will seek comment on updated guidelines on the large bank adjustment process and will not adjust assessment rates until the updated guidelines are approved by the fdic s board of directors 
under the new assessment rate schedule  effective april   the initial base assessment rate for large and highly complex insured depository institutions will range from five to thirty five basis points  and total base assessment rates  after applying all the unsecured debt and brokered deposit adjustments  will range from two and one half to forty five basis points 
in october  the fdic s board of directors adopted a new restoration plan to ensure that the dif reserve ratio reaches by september   as required by the reform act 
among other things  the new restoration plan provided that the fdic would forego the uniform three basis point increase in initial assessment rates that was previously scheduled to take effect on january  and would maintain the current assessment rate schedule for all insured depository institutions until the reserve ratio reaches 
the fdic intends to pursue further rulemaking in regarding the method that will be used to reach the reserve ratio of so that more of the cost of raising the reserve ratio to will be borne by institutions with more than billion in assets 
the impact is not yet determinable  but is likely to result in increased fdic premiums 
for  hudson city savings had an assessment rate of approximately basis points resulting in a deposit insurance assessment of million 
the deposit insurance assessment rates are in addition to the fico payments 
total expense for  including the fico assessment  was million 

table of contents on october   the fdic announced a temporary increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount from  to  per depositor through december   in response to the financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets 
in may  president obama signed the helping families save their homes act of  which  among other provisions  extended the expiration date of the temporary increase in the standard maximum deposit insurance amount from december  to december  to reflect this extension  the fdic adopted a final rule in september extending the increase in deposit insurance from  to  per depositor through december  subsequently  the reform act permanently increased the standard maximum deposit insurance amount from  to  effective as of july  in august  the fdic adopted final rules conforming its regulations to the provisions of the reform act relating to the new permanent standard maximum deposit insurance amount 
in accordance with the reform act  the fdic adopted rules in november and december of which provide for temporary unlimited insurance coverage of certain non interest bearing transactions accounts 
such coverage begins on december  and terminates on december  beginning january   such accounts will be insured under the general deposit insurance coverage rules of the fdic

under the community reinvestment act cra  as implemented by ots regulations  any federally chartered savings bank  including hudson city savings  has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
the cra requires the ots  in connection with its examination of a federally chartered savings bank  to assess the depository institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution 
current cra regulations rate an institution based on its actual performance in meeting community needs 
in particular  the evaluation system focuses on three tests a lending test  to evaluate the institution s record of making loans in its service areas  an investment test  to evaluate the institution s record of investing in community development projects  affordable housing  and programs benefiting low or moderate income individuals and businesses  and a service test  to evaluate the institution s delivery of services through its branches  atms and other offices 
the cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
hudson city savings has received a satisfactory rating in its most recent cra examination 
the agencies adopted regulations implementing the requirement under gramm leach that insured depository institutions publicly disclose certain agreements that are in fulfillment of the cra 
hudson city savings has no such agreements in place at this time 
loans to one borrower 
under hola  savings banks are generally subject to the national bank limits on loans to one borrower 
generally  savings banks may not make a loan or extend credit to a single or related group of borrowers in excess of of the institution s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
additional amounts may be loaned  not in excess of of unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus  if such loans or extensions of credit are secured by readily marketable collateral 
hudson city savings is in compliance with applicable loans to one borrower limitations 
at december   hudson city savings largest aggregate amount of loans to one borrower totaled million

interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage product risks 
on october   the ots and other federal bank regulatory authorities published the interagency guidance on nontraditional mortgage product risks  or the guidance 
the guidance describes sound practices for managing risk  as well as marketing  originating and servicing nontraditional mortgage products  which include  among other things  interest only 
table of contents loans 
the guidance sets forth supervisory expectations with respect to loan terms and underwriting standards  portfolio and risk management practices and consumer protection 
for example  the guidance indicates that originating interest only loans with reduced documentation is considered a layering of risk and that institutions are expected to demonstrate mitigating factors to support their underwriting decision and the borrower s repayment capacity 
on june   the ots and other federal bank regulatory agencies issued a final statement on subprime mortgage lending the statement to address the growing concerns facing the sub prime mortgage market  particularly with respect to rapidly rising sub prime default rates that may indicate borrowers do not have the ability to repay adjustable rate sub prime loans originated by financial institutions 
in particular  the agencies express concern in the statement that current underwriting practices do not take into account that many subprime borrowers are not prepared for payment shock and that the current subprime lending practices compound risk for financial institutions 
the statement describes the prudent safety and soundness and consumer protection standards that financial institutions should follow to ensure borrowers obtain loans that they can afford to repay 
the statement also reinforces the april  interagency statement on working with mortgage borrowers  in which the federal bank regulatory agencies encouraged institutions to work constructively with residential borrowers who are financially unable or reasonably expected to be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations on their home loans 
currently  we originate both interest only and interest only limited documentation loans 
we also purchase interest only loans 
we do not originate or purchase sub prime loans  negative amortization loans or option arm loans 
during  originations of interest only loans totaled billion  of which all were one to four family loans 
at december   our mortgage loan portfolio included billion of interest only loans  all of which were one to four family loans 
as part of our wholesale loan program  we have allowed sellers to include limited documentation loans in each pool of purchased mortgage loans but limit the amount of these loans to be no more than of the principal balance of the purchased pool 
in addition  these loans must have a maximum ltv of and meet other characteristics such as maximum loan size 
however  we have not tracked wholesale limited documentation loans on our mortgage loan system 
included in our loan portfolio at december  are billion of originated amortizing limited documentation loans and million of originated limited documentation interest only loans 
see residential mortgage lending 
we have evaluated the guidance and the statement to determine our compliance and  as necessary  modified our risk management practices  underwriting guidelines and consumer protection standards 
the guidance does not apply to all mortgage lenders with whom we compete for loans 
we do not believe the guidance will have a material adverse impact on our loan origination volumes in future periods 
guidance on commercial real estate lending 
in late  the ots adopted guidance entitled concentrations in commercial real estate cre lending  sound risk management practices  or the cre guidance  to address concentrations of commercial real estate loans in savings associations 
the cre guidance reinforces and enhances the ots s existing regulations and guidelines for real estate lending and loan portfolio management  but does not establish specific commercial real estate lending limits 
rather  the cre guidance seeks to promote sound risk management practices that will enable savings associations to continue to pursue commercial real estate lending in a safe and sound manner 
the cre guidance applies to savings associations with an accumulation of credit concentration exposures and asks that the associations quantify the additional risk such exposures may pose 
we do not have a concentration in commercial real estate and  although we added a commercial real estate lending platform as a result of the acquisition  commercial real estate loans have not become a material component of our loan portfolio or resulted in a concentration 
on october   the agencies adopted a policy statement supporting cre loan workouts  or the cre policy statement 
the cre policy statement provides guidance for examiners  and for financial institutions that are working with cre borrowers who are experiencing diminished operating cash flows  depreciated collateral values  or prolonged delays in selling or renting commercial properties 
the cre policy statement 
table of contents details risk management practices for loan workouts that support prudent and pragmatic credit and business decision making within the framework of financial accuracy  transparency  and timely loss recognition 
financial institutions that implement prudent loan workout arrangements after performing comprehensive reviews of borrowers financial conditions will not be subject to criticism for engaging in these efforts  even if the restructured loans have weaknesses that result in adverse credit classifications 
in addition  performing loans  including those renewed or restructured on reasonable modified terms  made to creditworthy borrowers  will not be subject to adverse classification solely because the value of the underlying collateral declined 
the cre policy statement reiterates existing guidance that examiners are expected to take a balanced approach in assessing institutions risk management practices for loan workout activities 
qualified thrift lender qtl test 
the hola requires federal savings banks to meet a qtl test

as of december   hudson city savings held of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments and had more than of its portfolio assets in qualified thrift investments for each of the months ending december  therefore  hudson city savings qualified under the qtl test 
a savings bank that fails the qtl test and does not convert to a bank charter generally will be prohibited from engaging in any new activity not permissible for a national bank  paying dividends not permissible under national bank regulations  and establishing any new branch office in a location not permissible for a national bank in the institution s home state 
in addition  if the institution does not requalify under the qtl test within three years after failing the test  the institution would be prohibited from engaging in any activity not permissible for a national bank

currently  hudson city savings must seek approval from the ots for future capital distributions 
hudson city savings may not pay dividends to hudson city bancorp if  after paying those dividends  it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements  or the ots notifies hudson city savings bank that it is in need of more than normal supervision 
under the fdia  an insured depository institution such as hudson city savings is prohibited from making capital distributions  including the payment of dividends  if  after making such distribution  the institution would become undercapitalized as such term is used in the fdia

liquidity 
hudson city savings maintains sufficient liquidity to ensure its safe and sound operation  in accordance with ots regulations 
assessments 
the ots charges assessments to recover the cost of examining federal savings banks and their affiliates

hudson city savings paid an assessment of million in based on the size of the bank

non dividend distributions include distributions in excess of hudson city savings current and accumulated earnings and profits  distributions in redemption of stock and distributions in partial or complete liquidation 
however  dividends paid out of hudson city savings current or accumulated earnings and profits  as calculated for federal income tax purposes  will not constitute non dividend distributions and  therefore  will not be included in hudson city savings income 

table of contents the amount of additional taxable income created from a non dividend distribution is equal to the lesser of hudson city savings base year reserve and supplemental reserve for losses on loans or an amount that  when reduced by the tax attributable to the income  is equal to the amount of the distribution 
thus  in certain situations  approximately one and one half times the non dividend distribution would be included in gross income for federal income tax purposes  assuming a federal corporate income tax rate

item a 
risk factors our ability to originate mortgage loans for portfolio has been adversely affected by the increased competition resulting from the unprecedented involvement of the us government and gses in the residential mortgage market 
over the past few years  we have faced increased competition for mortgage loans due to the unprecedented involvement of the gses in the mortgage market 
this involvement is a result of the recent economic crisis and has caused the interest rate for thirty year fixed rate mortgage loans that conform to the gses loan purchase guidelines to remain exceptionally low 
we originate and purchase such conforming loans and retain them for portfolio 
in addition  the us congress recently extended through september the expanded gse conforming loan limits in many of our operating markets  allowing larger balance loans to be acquired by the gses  and more loans in our portfolio qualified under the expanding conforming loan limits and were refinanced into fixed rate mortgages 
as a result of these factors  we expect that our one to four family loan repayments will remain at elevated levels  making it difficult for us to grow our mortgage loan portfolio 
accordingly  we are likely to experience a decrease in the size of our balance sheet while current economic conditions prevail 
both fannie mae and freddie mac are under conservatorship with the federal housing finance agency  an agency of the us government 
on february   the obama administration presented the us congress with a report of its proposals for reforming america s housing finance market with the goal of scaling back the role of the us government in  and promoting the return of private capital to  the mortgage markets and ultimately winding down fannie mae and freddie mac 
without mentioning a specific time frame  the report calls for the reduction of the role of fannie mae and freddie mac in the mortgage markets by  among other things  reducing conforming loan limits  increasing guarantee fees and requiring larger down payments by borrowers 
the report presents three options for the long term structure of housing finance  all of which call for the unwinding of fannie mae and freddie mac and a reduced role of the government in the mortgage market i a system with us government insurance limited to a narrowly targeted group of lower and moderate income borrowers  ii a system similar to i above except with an expanded guarantee during times of crisis  and iii a system where the us government offers reinsurance for the securities of a broad range of mortgages behind significant private capital 
we cannot be certain if or when fannie mae and freddie mac will be wound down  if or when reform of the housing finance market will be implemented or what the future role of the us government will be in the mortgage market  and  accordingly  we will not be able to determine the impact that any such reform may have on us until a definitive reform plan is adopted 
our concentration in structured borrowings  particularly borrowings putable at the option of the lender  could adversely affect our cost of funds and net interest margin if interest rates were to increase significantly 
in the past we funded a substantial portion of our asset growth using putable borrowings 
the borrowings have been generally long term to maturity  in an effort to offset our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk 
these long term borrowings have put options that could shorten their maturities in a changing interest rate environment 
if we experience a significant rising interest rate environment where interest rates increase above the interest rate for the borrowings  these borrowings will likely be put at their next put date and our cost to replace these borrowings would likely increase 
of our borrowings outstanding at 
table of contents december   billion were structured putable borrowings 
of these  billion had quarterly put options and billion had one time put options 
we currently have billion of borrowings that have the potential to be put back to us or will mature within the next months 
of the billion of borrowings  billion  with a weighted average rate of  are putable borrowings and billion of these could be put back to the bank within months 
given the current market rate environment  we believe none of these borrowings will be put during the next twelve months 
if interest rates were to increase and basis points  and no other factors affecting the put determination changed  the bank would expect approximately million and billion  respectively  to be put back to us within the next months 
therefore  in a significantly increasing rate environment  our cost of funds is expected to increase more rapidly than the yields earned on our loan portfolio and securities portfolio 
an increasing rate environment is expected to cause a narrowing of our net interest rate spread and a decrease in our earnings 
we experienced a contraction in our net interest margin during and  if current market conditions continue  expect further contractions in our net interest margin while changes in interest rates could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
our net interest margin for was compared to for the decline in our net interest margin was due to the declines in the average yields on our interest earning assets outpacing the declines in our average cost of funds over similar time frames 
the decline in our average yields reflects the combination of the overall low interest rate environment  the gses efforts to keep mortgage rates low to support the housing market and the continuation of the trend of homeowners to refinance their mortgage loans in the low rate environment 
the efforts by the gses has also had the effect of reducing our sources for purchasing loans in the secondary market as the sellers from whom we have historically purchased loans are originating loans at lower rates that we would accept  selling to the gses or keeping the loans in their portfolio 
the united states congress recently extended to september the time period within which the gse s may purchase loans under an expanded limit on principal balances that qualify as conforming loans 
further  on november   the fomc announced that the frb will purchase approximately billion of longer term us government securities  which is likely to put downward pressure on long term interest rates  including interest rates on mortgage related assets 
as a result  we expect this adverse environment for portfolio lending to continue  with the likely result that we will continue to experience compression of our net interest margin  and  in combination with the likelihood of a decrease in the size of our balance sheet  a reduction of net interest income 
our earnings may be adversely impacted by an increase in interest rates because of our mortgage related assets are fixed rate and will not reprice as interest rates increase 
in addition  included in our variable rate mortgage related assets are assets whose contractual next rate change date is over five years 
if these instruments were classified as fixed rate  the percentage of fixed rate mortgage related assets to total mortgage related assets would be as of december  in contrast  a majority of our interest bearing liabilities are expected to reprice as interest rates increase since they generally have much shorter contractual maturities 
a portion of our deposits as of december   including billion in interest bearing demand accounts and money market accounts  have no contractual maturities and are likely to reprice quickly as short term interest rates increase 
as of december   of our time deposits will mature within one year 
at december   we had billion of borrowings that had quarterly put options and billion that had one time put options 
we currently have billion of borrowings that have the potential to be put back to us or will mature within the next months  including billion that could be put back to the bank within months 
given the current market rate environment  we believe none of these borrowings will be put during the next twelve months 
however  if interest rates were to increase and basis points  and no other factors affecting the put determination changed  the bank would expect approximately million and billion  respectively  to be put back to us within the next months 
the fomc noted that economic activity has continued to improve  but the national unemployment rate has remained elevated 
household spending is increasing gradually  but remains constrained by high 
table of contents unemployment  modest income growth  lower housing wealth  and tight credit 
the national unemployment rate was in december as compared to in september and in december the fomc decided to maintain the overnight lending rate at zero to during we expect the operating environment to remain very challenging as the federal reserve board continues to focus their efforts on the economy 
interest rates will continue to fluctuate  and we cannot predict future federal reserve board actions or other factors that will cause rates to change 
if the yield curve were to flatten  the spread between our cost of funds and the interest received on our loan and securities portfolios would shrink 
the yield curve would begin to flatten in the event that long term interest rates declined or if short term market interest rates were to begin to increase through the actions of the fomc without a corresponding increase in long term rates 
in the case of an inverted yield curve  the cost of funds would be higher than the earnings generated from these portfolios 
as a result of the decreased spread from a flat or inverted yield curve  our net interest income would decrease 
we monitor interest rate risk sensitivity through analysis of the change in net interest income and net portfolio value  or npv 
npv is defined as the net present value of the expected future cash flows of an entity s assets and liabilities 
npv is analyzed using a model that estimates changes in npv and net interest income in response to a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the ots uses a similar model to monitor interest rate risk of all ots regulated institutions 
the bank is currently out of compliance with certain board established limits regarding its npv calculations 
in addition  we believe our interest rate risk position would be considered significant based on the ots written guidelines regarding npv analysis 
we are a residential portfolio mortgage lender and therefore have not sold loans in the secondary market 
as a result  we have a higher level of interest rate risk relative to many of our peer institutions 
based on our level of interest rate risk  as well as the enhanced regulatory scrutiny of larger financial institutions  we have concluded that we will need to maintain a capital cushion above the applicable regulatory requirements to be considered well capitalized 
future balance sheet restructuring may adversely affect our net income 
in recognition of our current interest rate risk position  we are examining various strategies to position our balance sheet for the future as market conditions change and allow for more profitable growth 
as a result  we expect to further restructure a portion of our funding mix 
the restructuring may include the continued modification of putable borrowings to extend or eliminate the put dates  the extinguishment of certain borrowings  the refinancing of certain borrowings or a combination of these actions 
the fair value of our borrowings  which is generally the value at which borrowings are extinguished  was approximately of carrying value at december  any restructuring could result in a decrease in the size of the balance sheet and a material charge to earnings 
we are subject to enhanced regulatory scrutiny in light of the recent financial crisis and the reform act  our interest rate risk position and significant growth since our stock offering in the recent economic recession and financial crisis  which has been marked by hundreds of bank failures  has resulted in significant government reaction both in terms of legislative actions and enhanced regulatory scrutiny 
legislative action has included adoption and implementation of the troubled asset relief program resulting in the significant investment of public monies in financial institutions  and the enactment of the reform act which will impose significant new regulatory burdens on us 
we believe the regulatory response to the financial crisis  the legislative directives to the banking regulators and related public reaction has resulted in significantly greater regulatory supervision of financial institutions  particularly larger institutions such as hudson city 
our growth since our initial public offering in  and particularly since our second step conversion in  has resulted in our becoming one of the largest domestic insured depository institutions by asset size 
we have enhanced systems and added to staff to keep up with the ordinary operational and regulatory burden normally associated with an institution of our size 
these efforts will be further enhanced  as we are faced with a greater regulatory burden under the reform act and the enhanced regulatory scrutiny based on our size in the current environment 
as a result  we will enhance our operational and compliance functions in a number of areas in order to meet the expected regulatory scrutiny 
this will result in additional investment in both technology and staffing that is likely to increase our non interest expense 
as a result of the enhanced regulatory scrutiny  our interest rate risk position  our funding concentration in structured borrowings  our significant growth since and certain regulatory compliance matters  we expect to become subject to an informal regulatory enforcement action in the form of a memorandum of understanding mou with the ots 
under an mou  the bank may be required to reduce its level of interest rate risk and funding concentration  adopt certain policies and procedures to achieve such reductions and address certain compliance matters 
in addition  the ots has the authority to establish higher capital requirements for individual institutions  impose restrictions on distributions from the bank to the company and restrict the ability of the company to pay dividends to its shareholders  to repurchase stock and to incur debt 
we have the intention and ability to comply with an mou 
the terms of any mou to which we may become subject  as well as any failure to comply with such mou  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations and on the value of our common stock 
the recent adoption of regulatory reform legislation has created uncertainty and may have a material effect on our operations and capital requirements 
there are many provisions of the reform act which are to be implemented through regulations to be adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies within specified time frames following the effective date of the reform act  which creates a risk of uncertainty as to the effect that such provisions will ultimately have 
although it is not possible for us to determine at this time whether the reform act will have a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations  we believe the following provisions of the reform act will have an impact on us the elimination of our primary federal regulator  the ots  and the assumption by the occ of regulatory authority over all federal savings associations  such as hudson city savings  and the acquisition by the frb of regulatory authority over all savings and loan holding companies  such as hudson city bancorp  as well as all subsidiaries of savings and loan holding companies other than depository institutions 
although the laws and regulations currently applicable to us generally will not change by virtue of the elimination of the ots except to the extent such laws have been modified by 
table of contents the reform act  the application of these laws and regulations may vary as administered by the occ and the frb 
the creation of the bureau  which will have the authority to implement and enforce a variety of existing consumer protection statutes and to issue new regulations and  with respect to institutions of our size  will have exclusive examination and enforcement authority with respect to such laws and regulations 
as a new independent bureau within the frb  it is possible that the bureau will focus more attention on consumers and may impose requirements more severe than the previous bank regulatory agencies  which at a minimum  could increase our operating and compliance costs 
the significant roll back of the federal preemption of state consumer protection laws that is currently enjoyed by federal savings associations and national banks 
as a result  we may now be subject to state consumer protection laws in each state where we do business  and those laws may be interpreted and enforced differently in different states 
the establishment of consolidated risk based and leverage capital requirements for insured depository institutions  depository institution holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies  as discussed below 
the increase in the minimum designated reserve ratio for the dif from to of insured deposits  which must be reached by september   and the requirement that deposit insurance assessments be based on average consolidated total assets minus our average tangible equity  rather than on our deposit bases 
as a result of these provisions  our deposit insurance premiums are expected to increase  and the increase may be substantial  as discussed below 
the reform act imposes further restrictions on transactions with affiliates and extensions of credit to executive officers  director and principal shareholders  by  among other things  expanding covered transactions to include securities lending  repurchase agreement and derivatives activities with affiliates 
these changes are effective one year after the designated transfer date 
the reform act also includes provisions  subject to further rulemaking by the federal bank regulatory agencies  that may affect our future operations  including provisions that create minimum standards for the origination of mortgages  restrict proprietary trading by banking entities  restrict the sponsorship of and investment in hedge funds and private equity funds by banking entities and that remove certain obstacles to the conversion of savings associations to national banks 
we will not be able to determine the impact of these provisions until final rules are promulgated to implement these provisions and other regulatory guidance is provided interpreting these provisions 
as a result of the reform act and other proposed changes  we may become subject to more stringent capital requirements 
the reform act requires the federal banking agencies to establish consolidated risk based and leverage capital requirements for insured depository institutions  depository institution holding companies and systemically important nonbank financial companies 
these requirements must be no less than those to which insured depository institutions are currently subject 
as a result  in july  we will become subject to consolidated capital requirements which we have not been subject to previously 
in addition  the basel committee on banking supervision recently announced the new basel iii capital rules  which set new standards for common equity  tier and total capital  determined on a risk weighted basis 
it is not yet known how these standards  which will be phased in over a period of years  will be implemented by us regulators generally or how they will be applied to financial institutions of our size 

table of contents the fdic restoration plan and related rulemaking may have a negative impact on our results operations 
in light of the failures of a significant number of banks and thrifts over the past several years  which has resulted in substantial losses to the dif  in july  the reform act increased the minimum designated reserve ratio for the dif from to of insured deposits  which must be reached by september   and provides that in setting the assessments necessary to meet the new requirement  the fdic shall offset the effect of this provision on insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than billion  so that more of the cost of raising the reserve ratio will be borne by the institutions with more than billion in assets  such as hudson city savings 
in october  the fdic adopted a new restoration plan to ensure that the dif reserve ratio reaches by september   as required by the reform act 
the fdic intends to pursue further rulemaking in regarding the method that will be used to reach the reserve ratio of so that more of the cost of raising the reserve ratio to will be borne by institutions with more than billion in assets 
in addition  on february   the fdic adopted a final rule that redefines the assessment base for deposit insurance assessments as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity  rather than on deposit bases  as required by the reform act  and revises the risk based assessment system for all large insured depository institutions as described in greater detail under regulation of hudson city savings bank and hudson city bancorp deposit insurance 
the adoption of this final rule could result in even higher fdic deposit insurance assessments effective april   which could further increase non interest expense and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
hudson city savings bank s ability to pay dividends or lend funds to hudson city bancorp is subject to regulatory limitations which  to the extent we need but are not able to access such funds  may prevent us from making future dividend payments 
we are a unitary savings and loan association holding company regulated by the ots and almost all of our operating assets are owned by hudson city savings bank 
we rely primarily on dividends from the bank to pay cash dividends to our shareholders and to engage in share repurchase programs 
the ots regulates all capital distributions by the bank directly or indirectly to us  including dividend payments 
as the subsidiary of a savings and loan association holding company  the bank must file a notice or seek affirmative approval from 
table of contents the ots at least days prior to each proposed capital distribution 
whether an application is required is based on a number of factors including whether the institution qualifies for expedited treatment under the ots rules and regulations or if the total amount of all capital distributions including each proposed capital distribution for the applicable calendar year exceeds net income for that year to date plus the retained net income for the preceding two years 
currently  hudson city savings must seek approval from the ots for future capital distributions 
in addition  the bank may not pay dividends to us if  after paying those dividends  it would fail to meet the required minimum levels under risk based capital guidelines and the minimum leverage and tangible capital ratio requirements or the ots has notified the bank that it is in need of more than normal supervision 
under the prompt corrective action provisions of the fdia  an insured depository institution such as the bank is prohibited from making a capital distribution  including the payment of dividends  if  after making such distribution  the institution would become undercapitalized as such term is used in the fdia 
payment of dividends by the bank also may be restricted at any time at the discretion of the appropriate regulator if it deems the payment to constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the bank will be able to pay dividends at past levels  or at all  in the future 
in addition to regulatory restrictions on the payment of dividends  the bank is subject to certain restrictions imposed by federal law on any extensions of credit it makes to its affiliates and on investments in stock or other securities of its affiliates 
we are considered an affiliate of the bank 
these restrictions prevent affiliates of the bank  including us  from borrowing from the bank  unless various types of collateral secure the loans 
federal law limits the aggregate amount of loans to and investments in any single affiliate to of the bank s capital stock and surplus and also limits the aggregate amount of loans to and investments in all affiliates to of the bank s capital stock and surplus 
if we do not receive sufficient cash dividends or are unable to borrow from the bank  then we may not have sufficient funds to pay dividends or repurchase our common stock 
the geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 
originating loans secured by residential real estate is our primary business 
our financial results may be adversely affected by changes in prevailing economic conditions  either nationally or in our local new jersey and metropolitan new york market areas  including decreases in real estate values  adverse employment conditions  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal and state government and other significant external events 
as a result of our lending practices  we have a concentration of loans secured by real property located primarily in new jersey  new york and connecticut 
at december   approximately of our total loans are in the new york metropolitan area 
financial institutions continue to be affected by the sharp declines in the real estate market that occurred over the last three years as well as the effects of the recent recessionary economy 
declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including job losses  have had and may continue to have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  decreases in real estate values have adversely affected the value of property used as collateral for our loans and result in higher loss experience on our non performing loans 
adverse changes in the economy  particularly in employment conditions  may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans  which would have an adverse impact on our earnings 
if poor economic conditions result in decreased demand for real estate loans  our profits may decrease because our investment alternatives may earn less income for us than real estate loans 

table of contents we operate in a highly regulated industry  which limits the manner and scope of our business activities 
we are subject to extensive supervision  regulation and examination by the ots and by the fdic 
as a result  we are limited in the manner in which we conduct our business  undertake new investments and activities and obtain financing 
this regulatory structure is designed primarily for the protection of the deposit insurance funds and our depositors  and not to benefit our shareholders 
this regulatory structure also gives the regulatory authorities extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to capital levels  the timing and amount of dividend payments  the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
in addition  we must comply with significant anti money laundering and anti terrorism laws 
government agencies have substantial discretion to impose significant monetary penalties on institutions which fail to comply with these laws 
as a result of the financial crisis which occurred in the banking and financial markets commencing in the second half of  the overall bank regulatory climate is now marked by caution  conservatism and a renewed focus on compliance and risk management 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
the banking industry is highly competitive 
the company competes for loans  deposits and other financial services in its markets and surrounding areas 
in addition to local  regional  and national banking competition in the markets it serves  the company competes with other financial institutions  money market and other mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage companies and other non depository financial service companies  including certain governmental organizations which may offer subsidized financing at lower rates than those offered by the bank 
beginning in  general economic conditions were impacted by credit and capital market turmoil followed by significant deterioration in the banking industry and a general downturn in the economy 
the continuing weakened performance of the banking industry has provided particular competitive pressure 
a combination of a difficult lending environment with historically high cost of certificates of deposit and other consumer pricing compared to other borrowing alternatives and asset yields has increased the pressure on net interest margin at the bank  as well as at most other community banking organizations in their markets 
non performing assets take significant time to resolve and adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
non performing assets adversely affect the company s net earnings in various ways 
the company expects to continue to have a provision for loan losses relating to non performing loans that is higher than its historical experience 
the company generally does not record interest income on non performing loans or other real estate owned  thereby reducing its earnings  while its loan administration costs are higher for non performing loans 
when the company takes collateral in foreclosures and similar proceedings  the company is required to mark the related asset to the then fair market value of the collateral  which may ultimately result in a loss 
an increase in the level of non performing assets increases the company s risk profile and may affect the capital levels regulators believe are appropriate 
at december  our non performing loans amounted to million or of total loans as compared to million or of total loans at december  and our charge offs amounted to million for as compared to million in there can be no assurance that the company will not experience future increases in non performing assets 

table of contents the recently publicized foreclosure issues affecting the nation s largest mortgage loan servicers could impact our foreclosure process and timing to completion of foreclosures 
several of the nation s largest mortgage loan servicers have experienced highly publicized compliance issues with respect to their foreclosure processes 
this has resulted in greater bank regulatory  court and state attorney general scrutiny and consumer lawsuits 
these difficulties and the potential legal and regulatory responses could impact the foreclosure process and timing to completion of foreclosures for residential mortgage lenders generally  including the company 
over the past few years  foreclosure timelines have increased in general due to  among other reasons  processing delays associated with the significant increase in the number of foreclosure cases as a result of the economic crisis and voluntary and in some cases mandatory programs intended to permit or require lenders to consider loan modifications or other alternatives to foreclosure 
in addition  the superior court of new jersey has served an order on the largest mortgage loan servicers in the country inquiring as to the servicers foreclosure practices and requiring each to produce evidence of compliance with new jersey state law 
the superior court has asked an additional group of mortgage servicers in new jersey  including the company  to produce documentation demonstrating that there are no irregularities in the handling of foreclosure proceedings 
it is expected that this process will further delay the foreclosure process in the state of new jersey 
the company is expected to timely file the requested documents 
the company is not a defendant in a lawsuit nor is it a target of any particular investigation 
further increases in the foreclosure timeline may have an adverse effect on collateral values and our ability to maximize our recoveries
