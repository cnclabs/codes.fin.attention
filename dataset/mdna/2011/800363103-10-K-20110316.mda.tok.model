item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview net income available to common stockholders for sandy spring bancorp  inc and subsidiaries the company for the year ended december   totaled million per diluted common share  compared to a net loss available to common stockholders of million per diluted common share for the prior year 
these results reflect the following events during  the company redeemed the full amount of the preferred stock issued under the tarp capital purchase program which totaled  shares or million net of the discount 
during  the company recorded charges of million representing the remaining unamortized discount and charges of million for dividends on the preferred stock 
on february  the company repurchased the warrant issued to the u 
s 
treasury in conjunction with the issuance of the preferred stock discussed above for million which is not reflected in our financial statements as of december  an increase in net interest income due primarily to a decline in rates paid on deposits  which more than offset a decrease in the yield on interest earning assets 
while a lack of new loan generation  caused largely by the current state of the economy  caused downward pressure on the margin  this was somewhat offset by the decline in average non performing loans 
these factors resulted in a net interest margin increase to in from in a decrease in the provision for loan and lease losses to million in from million in due mainly to lower charge offs  decreases in internal risk rating downgrades and specific reserves on a reduced level of non performing loans 
non interest expenses remained level compared to the prior year 
this included increases in salaries and benefits expenses and other non interest expenses which were offset by declines in fdic insurance expense and amortization of intangible assets 
in the national and local economies began a slow turnaround which was affected by a number of factors and events 
the equity markets exhibited volatility as concerns over the financial stability of several countries in europe continued 
in addition  the recently passed health care law  financial reform and tax legislation created a high degree of economic uncertainty among businesses of all sizes  which served to limit business expansion and employment 
while positive economic indicators began to emerge late in  these trends and events were reflected in the low demand for loans and a depressed real estate market that exerted pressure on virtually all facets of bank performance for the year 
despite this challenging business environment  the bank s management team continued to aggressively deal with and resolve existing non performing loans 
these efforts were further reinforced by a significant reduction in the migration of new credits to non performing status 
the net interest margin increased to in compared to in as market rates remained at historically low levels throughout most of the year 
deposits at year end decreased compared to the prior year end 
this decline occurred in the second half of as clients redeployed funds in the face of continuing low rates and rising equity markets 
the loan portfolio decreased in compared to the prior year end due primarily to continued soft loan demand as a result of the factors mentioned above 
the decrease in rates paid on deposits exceeded the decline in yields earned on loans 
a strong level of liquidity was maintained during the past year through borrowing lines with the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the federal reserve and the size of the investment portfolio 
the company experienced improvement in the level of credit risk during as non performing assets decreased to million from million in this decrease was due primarily to the company s aggressive efforts to resolve non performing loans  particularly in its commercial real estate portfolio 
lastly  but as important  is capital adequacy 
despite the challenges discussed above  the company has remained above all well capitalized regulatory requirement levels 
the company issued common stock during which resulted in proceeds of million  which more than offset the redemption of million in preferred stock issued under tarp 
comparing december  balances to december   total assets decreased to billion 
loan balances decreased compared to the prior year due to decreases of in commercial loans  in consumer loans and in residential mortgage and construction loans 
customer funding sources  which include deposits plus other short term borrowings from core customers  decreased compared to this decrease was due primarily to anticipated declines of in certificates of deposit and in money market accounts as clients redeployed funds due to low rates and rising equity markets 
during the same period  stockholders equity increased to million or of total assets 
net interest income increased by million  or  mainly due to a decrease of basis points in the cost of interest bearing liabilities  which exceeded the basis point decline in the yield on interest earning assets 
in addition  another positive factor supporting the net interest margin was a decline in non performing assets of million from million at december  to million at december  non interest income increased by to million compared to the prior year 
this increase was due primarily to an increase of in fees on sales of investment products  due to higher sales of mutual funds and an increase of in trust and investment management fees due to higher assets under management 
these increases were somewhat offset by a decline of in service charges on deposits due to lower commercial account analysis fees and return check charges 
non interest income totaled of total revenue  which is composed of net interest income and non interest income 
non interest expenses remained level compared to the prior year 
increases in salaries and benefits expenses and other non interest expenses were largely offset by decreases in fdic insurance expense and intangibles amortization 
non performing assets reflected a significant decrease to million at december  compared to million at december  this decrease was due primarily to a decrease in non accrual loans  particularly in the commercial real estate mortgage and construction portfolios as a result of charge offs and pay downs on existing problem credits and a substantial reduction in the migration of new credits to non performing status 
non performing assets represented of total assets at year end  versus at year end the ratio of net charge offs to average loans and leases was in  compared to in critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements may reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently rely to a greater extent on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary for assets and liabilities that are required to be recorded at fair value 
a decline in the assets required to be recorded at fair values will warrant an impairment write down or valuation allowance to be established 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when readily available 
the following accounting policies  read in conjunction with the applicable portions of note significant accounting polices of the consolidated financial statements  comprise those policies that management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results allowance for loan and lease losses  goodwill impairment  accounting for income taxes  fair value measurements  including assessment of other than temporary impairment  defined benefit pension plan 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses is an estimate of the losses that are inherent in the loan and lease portfolio at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is based on two basic principles of accounting the requirement that a loss be accrued when it is probable that the loss has occurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated and the requirement that losses  if any  be accrued when it is probable that the company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the loan s or lease s contractual terms 
management believes that the allowance is adequate 
however  its determination requires significant judgment  and estimates of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed 
while management uses available information to recognize probable losses  future additions or reductions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the loans and leases comprising the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers  such as may result from changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  and independent consultants engaged by the company  periodically review the loan and lease portfolio and the allowance 
such review may result in additional provisions based on their judgments of information available at the time of each examination 
the company s allowance for loan and lease losses has two basic components a general reserve reflecting historical losses by loan category  as adjusted by several factors whose effects are not reflected in historical loss ratios  and specific allowances for separately identified loans 
each of these components  and the systematic allowance methodology used to establish them  are described in detail in note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december  the amount of the allowance is reviewed monthly by the credit risk committee of the board of directors and formally approved quarterly by that same committee of the board 
general reserves are based upon historical loss experience by portfolio segment measured  over the prior eight quarters  weighted so that losses realized in the most recent quarters have the greatest effect 
the historical loss experience is supplemented to address various risk characteristics of the company s loan portfolio including trends in delinquencies and other non performing loans  changes in the risk profile related to large loans in the portfolio  changes in the categories of loans comprising the loan portfolio  concentrations of loans to specific industry segments  changes in economic conditions on both a local and national level  changes in the company s credit administration and loan portfolio management processes  and quality of the company s credit risk identification processes 
the general reserve comprised of the total allowance at december  and at december  the general reserve is calculated in two parts based on an internal risk classification of loans within each portfolio segment 
reserves on loans considered to be classified under regulatory guidance are calculated separately from loans considered to be pass rated under the same guidance 
this segregation allows the company to monitor the reserves applicable to higher risk loans separate from the remainder of the portfolio in order to better manage risk and ensure the sufficiency of reserves 
the portion of the reserve representing specific allowances is derived by accumulating the specific allowances established on internally risk rated individually impaired loans that have significant conditions or circumstances that indicate that a loss may be probable 
each risk rating category is assigned a credit risk factor based on management s estimate of the associated risk  complexity  and size of the individual loans within the category 
specific reserves are calculated on individually impaired loans and established based on the company s calculation of the probable losses inherent in an individual loan 
for loans on which the company has not elected to use the collateral value as a basis to establish the measure of impairment  the company measures impairment based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
in determining the cash flows to be included in the discount calculation the company considers a number of factors the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  support available from financial guarantors  and the adequacy of collateral value and the ultimate realization of that value at liquidation 
these factors combine to estimate the probability and severity of potential losses 
at december   the specific allowance accounted for of the total allowance as compared to at december  the severity of estimated losses on impaired loans can differ substantially from actual losses 
goodwill impairment goodwill is the excess of the fair value of liabilities assumed over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the company s reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets  including goodwill 
the company s reporting units were identified based upon an analysis of each of its individual operating segments 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit requires the company to use a high degree of subjectivity 
if the fair values of the reporting units exceed their book values  no write down of recorded goodwill is necessary 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than book value  an expense may be required to write down the related goodwill to the proper carrying value 
the company tests for impairment of goodwill as of october of each year  and again at any quarter end if any triggering events occur during a quarter that may affect goodwill 
examples of such events include  but are not limited to adverse action by a regulator or a loss of key personnel 
the company engages a third party valuation firm to determine the fair value of the reporting units to utilize in the step one test for potential goodwill impairment 
the company and the valuation firm determined that a combination of the income approach and the market approach were most appropriate in valuing the fair value of the reporting units and determined that a step two test for impairment was not necessary 
at december  there was no evidence of impairment of goodwill or intangibles 
accounting for income taxes the company accounts for income taxes by recording deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities 
the judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws 
if actual results differ from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating the amount and timing of tax recognized  there can be no assurance that additional expenses will not be required in future periods 
the company s accounting policy follows the prescribed authoritative guidance that a minimal probability threshold of a tax position must be met before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the company recognized  when applicable  interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in other non interest expenses in the consolidated statements of income loss 
assessment of uncertain tax positions requires careful consideration of the technical merits of a position based on management s analysis of tax regulations and interpretations 
significant judgment may be involved in applying the applicable reporting and accounting requirements 
management expects that the company s adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in increased volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates because of the requirement that any change in judgment or measurement of a tax position taken in a prior period be recognized as a discrete event in the period in which it occurs 
factors that could impact management s judgment include changes in income  tax laws and regulations  and tax planning strategies 
fair value measurements the company  in accordance with applicable accounting standards  measures certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
significant financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis are investment securities available for sale  residential mortgages held for sale and commercial loan interest rate swap agreements 
loans with respect to which it is probable that the company will not collect all principal and interest payments according to the contractual terms are considered impaired loans and are measured on a nonrecurring basis 
the company conducts a review each quarter for all investment securities that reflect possible impairment to determine whether unrealized losses are other than temporary 
valuations for the investment portfolio are determined using quoted market prices  where available 
if quoted market prices are not available  such valuation is based on pricing models  quotes for similar investment securities  and  where necessary  an income valuation approach based on the present value of expected cash flows 
in addition  the company considers the financial condition of the issuer  the receipt of principal and interest according to the contractual terms and the intent and ability of the company to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
the above accounting policies with respect to fair value are discussed in further detail in note fair value to the consolidated financial statements 
defined benefit pension plan the company has a qualified  noncontributory  defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees 
the plan was frozen for new and existing entrants after december  and all benefit accruals for employees were frozen as of december  based on past service 
future salary increases and additional years of service will no longer affect the defined benefit provided by the plan although additional vesting may continue to occur 
several factors affect the net periodic benefit cost of the plan  including the size and characteristics of the plan population  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions 
pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plan and other factors including salary  age  years of employment  and the terms of the plan 
as a result of the plan freeze  the characteristics of the plan population should not have a materially different effect in future years 
the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations 
the discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the plan to a yield curve based on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date  which is december of each year 
the discount rate is adjusted each year on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is based on a number of factors that include expectations of market performance and the target asset allocation adopted in the plan investment policy 
should actual asset returns deviate from the projected returns  this can affect the benefit plan expense recognized in the financial statements

net interest income the largest source of the company s operating revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
for purposes of this discussion and analysis  the interest earned on tax exempt investment securities has been adjusted to an amount comparable to interest subject to normal income taxes 
the result is referred to as tax equivalent interest income and tax equivalent net interest income 
the following discussion of net interest income should be considered in conjunction with the review of the information provided on the preceding table

through a major deposit growth campaign in  the company saw strong growth in its deposit market share 
during  the company experienced a planned decline in deposits as it managed its net interest margin through reductions in rates 
much of this decrease  particularly in time deposits  was incurred with single product clients  and thus did not significantly affect clients with multiple product relationships 
most of this growth in deposits was deployed into investment securities to provide the necessary liquidity should loan demand increase in the future 
vs 
in  interest expense decreased by or million  compared to  due largely to a basis point decline in the average rate paid on deposits and borrowings  which more than offset the increase in average interest bearing deposits

most of the growth in deposits was deployed into investment securities 
interest rate performance vs 
the net interest margin increased by basis points in compared to  as compared to an increase in net interest spread of basis points in compared to the increase in these two indicators of interest rate performance was due primarily to the decrease in rates paid on interest bearing liabilities of basis points which more than offset the decline in yield on interest earning assets of basis points together with an increase in noninterest bearing demand deposits 
vs 
in  the net interest margin decreased by basis points compared to this decrease was due to the decline in the yield on interest earning assets of basis points which was significantly more than the decline in the funding rate on interest bearing liabilities of basis points

these increases were largely offset by a decrease of million in fdic insurance expense and a decrease of million in intangibles amortization 
salaries and employee benefits  the largest component of non interest expenses  increased million or in this increase was due primarily to higher salary expenses as a result of merit increases and severance payments 
average full time equivalent employees remained relatively constant from to in  occupancy expense increased million compared to the prior year due mainly to higher rent and maintenance expenses

amortization of intangible assets decreased million or compared to due to certain intangibles from branch acquisitions that had fully amortized as of september  operating expense performance management views the gaap efficiency ratio as an important financial measure of expense performance and cost management 
the ratio expresses the level of non interest expenses as a percentage of total revenue net interest income plus total non interest income 
lower ratios indicate improved productivity 
non gaap financial measure the company has for many years used a traditional efficiency ratio that is a non gaap financial measure of operating expense control and efficiency of operations 
management believes that its traditional ratio better focuses attention on the operating performance of the company over time than does a gaap ratio  and is highly useful in comparing period to period operating performance of the company s core business operations 
it is used by management as part of its assessment of its performance in managing non interest expenses 
however  this measure is supplemental  and is not a substitute for an analysis of performance based on gaap measures 
the reader is cautioned that the non gaap efficiency ratio used by the company may not be comparable to gaap or non gaap efficiency ratios reported by other financial institutions 
in general  the efficiency ratio is non interest expenses as a percentage of net interest income plus non interest income 
non interest expenses used in the calculation of the non gaap efficiency ratio exclude goodwill impairment losses  the amortization of intangibles  and non recurring expenses 
income for the non gaap ratio includes the favorable effect of tax exempt income  and excludes securities gains and losses  which vary widely from period to period without appreciably affecting operating expenses  and non recurring gains 
the measure is different from the gaap efficiency ratio  which also is presented in this report 
the gaap measure is calculated using non interest expense and income amounts as shown on the face of the consolidated statements of income loss 
the gaap and non gaap efficiency ratios are reconciled and provided in the following table 
both efficiency ratios decreased in mainly as a result of non interest expenses  which remained level in compared to together with an increase in net interest income in gaap and non gaap efficiency ratios year ended december  dollars in thousands gaap efficiency ratio non interest expenses net interest income plus non interest income efficiency ratio gaap non gaap efficiency ratio non interest expenses less non gaap adjustment amortization of intangible assets goodwill impairment loss plus non gaap adjustment pension prior service credit non interest expenses as adjusted net interest income plus non interest income plus non gaap adjustment tax equivalent income less non gaap adjustments securities gains otti recognized in earnings net interest income plus non interest income as adjusted efficiency ratio non gaap income taxes the company had income tax expense of million in  compared with an income tax benefit of million in and income tax expense of million in the resulting effective tax rates were for  for  and for the change in the effective tax rate for compared to was due mainly to the company s return to profitability in and the loss incurred in  primarily related to the provision for loan and lease losses  coupled with tax advantaged income from investment securities and bank owned life insurance policies 
the change in the effective tax rate for compared to was due to the factors mentioned previously 
financial condition the company total assets decreased million to billion at december  earning assets decreased million to billion at december  these decreases were due primarily to a decline in the loan portfolio  which was driven by current economic conditions in the company s markets 
loans and leases the residential real estate portfolio comprised of residential construction and permanent residential mortgage loans  decreased million or  to million at december  residential construction loans declined to million in  a decrease of million or reflecting continued depressed demand as a result of the regional economic conditions 
permanent residential mortgages  most of which are family  decreased million or to million due to lower loan origination volumes 
the commercial loans and leases portfolio decreased by million or  to billion at december  this decrease was due primarily to soft loan demand resulting from weak market conditions in the regional and national economies 
included in this category are commercial real estate loans  commercial construction loans and commercial business loans 
the company commercial real estate loans consist of owner occupied properties where an established banking relationship exists or  to a lesser extent  involves investment properties for warehouse  retail  and office space with a history of occupancy and cash flow 
commercial mortgages decreased million or during  to million at year end 
commercial construction loans decreased million or during the year  to million at december  economic conditions continued to have a negative effect on builders and developers over the past year as consumer demand for new housing remained depressed in the face of a weak economic turnaround 
this mainly affected the company s acquisition  development and construction loan portfolio 
commercial business loans decreased million or during to million at year end 
this decrease was also due primarily to the lower level of loan demand 
the company equipment leasing business provides leases for essential commercial equipment used by small to medium sized businesses 
equipment leasing is conducted through vendor relations and direct solicitation to end users located primarily in states along the east coast from new jersey to florida 
the typical lease is small ticket by industry standards  averaging less than thousand  with individual leases generally not exceeding thousand 
the leasing portfolio decreased million or in  to million at year end due in large part to market conditions and their effect on small and medium sized businesses 
consumer lending continues to play an important role in the company s full service  community banking business 
this category of loans includes primarily home equity loans and lines of credit 
the consumer loan portfolio decreased or million  to million at december  this decline was driven largely by a decrease of million or in home equity lines and loans during to million at year end due to weak consumer demand 
installment loans declined million or to million during analysis of loans and leases the following table presents the trends in the composition of the loan and lease portfolio over the previous five years

this investment strategy has resulted in a portfolio with minimal risk and relatively short durations and thus will provide needed liquidity should loan demand increase in the coming year 
the portfolio is monitored on a continuing basis with consideration given to interest rate trends and the structure of the yield curve and with constant due diligence of economic projections and analysis 
at december   the trust preferred portfolio consisted of one million security backed by a single financial institution issuer 
the fair value of this security was million as determined using broker quotations 
the company also owns one pooled trust preferred security backed by debt issued by banks and thrifts  which totals million  with a fair value of million 
the fair value of this security was determined by a third party valuation specialist due to the limited trading activity for this security in the marketplace 
the specialist used an income valuation approach technique present value technique that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs 
the methodology and significant assumptions employed by the specialist to determine fair value included evaluation of the structural terms as established in the indenture  detailed credit and structural evaluation for each piece of collateral in the pool  default  recovery and prepayment amortization probabilities  identification of adverse conditions specifically related to the security  industry and geographical area  projection of estimated cash flows that incorporate default expectations and loss severities  review of historical and implied volatility of the fair value of the security  evaluation of credit risk concentrations  evaluation of the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the amortized cost  and a discount rate of was established using credit adjusted financial institution spreads for comparably rated institutions and a liquidity adjustment that considered the previously noted characteristics 
as a result of this evaluation  it was determined that the pooled trust preferred security did incur credit related otti of thousand which was recognized in earnings for the year ended december  non credit related otti on this security  which is not expected to be sold and that the company has the ability to hold until maturity  was thousand for the year ended december  this non credit related otti was recognized in other comprehensive income oci at december  the methodology and significant inputs used to measure the amount related to credit loss consisted of the following default rates were developed based on the financial condition of the trust preferred issuers in the pool and the payment or deferral status 
conditional default rates were estimated based on the payment characteristics of the security and the financial condition of the issuers in the pool 
near term and future defaults are estimated using third party industry data in addition to a review of key financial ratios and other pertinent data on the financial stability of the underlying issuer  loss severity is forecasted based on the type of impairment using research performed by third parities  the security only contains one level of subordination below the senior tranche  with the senior tranche receiving the spread from the subordinate bonds 
given recent performance  it is not expected that the senior tranche will receive its full interest and principal at the bond s maturity date  credit ratings of the underlying issuers are reviewed in conjunction with the development of the default rates applied to determine the credit amounts related to the credit loss  and potential prepayments are estimated based on terms and rates of the underlying trust preferred securities to determine the impact of excess spread on the credit enhancement  the removal of the strongest institutions from the underlying pool and any impact that prepayments might have on diversity and concentration 
at december   the company held thousand in marketable equity securities of two entities 
the quarterly reviews conducted during of each entity financial statements and review of other recently available data determined that otti existed with respect to one of the investments 
as a result  the company recognized in earnings for the year ended december  credit related otti of thousand which represented the company s entire investment in the particular institution

for the same period  interest bearing deposits declined million or 
this decrease was due largely to a decrease of million or in time deposits 
money market deposits also decreased million or 
these decreases were due mainly to reductions in rates as the company managed its net interest margin together with clients redeployment of funds in the face of low rates and rising equity markets 
in addition  regular savings and interest bearing checking accounts increased million or over as clients maintained liquidity in a slowly recovering economy 
when deposits are combined with retail repurchase agreements from core customers  the decrease in total customer funding sources totaled compared to the prior year 
total borrowings were virtually level at million at december  compared to december  capital management management monitors historical and projected earnings  dividends and asset growth  as well as risks associated with the various types of on and off balance sheet assets and liabilities  in order to determine appropriate capital levels 
during  total stockholders equity increased or million to million at december   from million at december  this increase was due primarily to million in proceeds from the company s public stock offering in and increased profitability which were somewhat offset by the company s redemption of the million in preferred stock issued to the united states department of the treasury treasury as part of the tarp capital purchase program 
as part of tarp  the company sold  shares of fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock and a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock  for an aggregate price of million in cash 
the redemption of the preferred shares was completed in two transactions  with one half of the shares redeemed in july and the remainder of the shares redeemed in december  for a total of million 
at december   the warrant remained outstanding and was valued in the consolidated financial statements at million 
this amount was allocated from the original sale proceeds and reflected in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated statements of condition 
subsequent to december   the company negotiated the redemption of the warrant with the treasury for million  which was completed on february  the effect of the redemption will result in a net reduction of additional paid in capital of million during the first quarter of external capital formation  resulting from a public offering of common stock  exercises of stock options  vesting of restricted stock and from stock issuances under the employee and director stock purchase plans totaled million during the ratio of average equity to average assets was for  as compared to for and for the company s articles of incorporation authorize  shares of capital stock par value per share

on march   the company completed an offering of  common shares at a price of per share  before the underwriting discount of per share 
this resulted in proceeds of million  net of the offering expenses 
each share of the issued common stock has the same relative rights as  and is identical in all respects with  each other share of common stock 
a significant portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the securities was used during to redeem the million in preferred stock issued to the treasury under tarp and million was use to redeem the warrant in february management intends to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the sale of the securities for general corporate purposes which may include financing possible acquisitions of branches or other financial institutions or financial service companies  extending credit to  or funding investments in  our subsidiaries and repaying  reducing or refinancing indebtedness 
the company expects that it will  on a recurrent basis  engage in additional financings as the need arises to finance corporate strategies  to fund subsidiaries  to finance acquisitions or otherwise 
bank holding companies and banks are required to maintain capital ratios in accordance with guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulators 
these guidelines are commonly known as risk based capital guidelines 
the actual regulatory ratios and required ratios for capital adequacy  in addition to the ratios required to be categorized as well capitalized are summarized in the following table 
risk based capital ratios minimum ratios at december  regulatory requirements total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier leverage tier capital of million and total qualifying capital of million each included million in trust preferred securities that are considered regulatory capital for purposes of determining the company s tier capital ratio 
in addition  in  tier capital included million in preferred stock which was sold to the us treasury under the tarp capital purchase program as described above 
as of december   the most recent notification from the bank s primary regulator categorized the bank as a well capitalized institution under the prompt corrective action rules of the federal deposit insurance act 
designation as a well capitalized institution under these regulations is not a recommendation or endorsement of the company or the bank by federal bank regulators

tangible common equity tangible equity and tangible assets are non gaap financial measures calculated using gaap amounts 
we calculate tangible equity by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets from our calculation of stockholders equity 
we calculate tangible assets by excluding the balance of goodwill and other intangible assets from our calculation of total assets 
we believe that this non gaap financial measure provides information to investors that may useful in understanding our financial condition 
because not all companies use the same calculation of tangible equity and tangible assets  this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures calculated by other companies 
a reconciliation of the non gaap ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets is provided in the following table

the company s loan and lease portfolio is subject to varying degrees of credit risk 
credit risk entails both general risks  which are inherent in the process of lending  and risk specific to individual borrowers 
the company s credit risk is mitigated through portfolio diversification  which limits exposure to any single customer  industry or collateral type 
typically  each consumer and residential lending product has a generally predictable level of credit losses based on historical loss experience 
home mortgage and home equity loans and lines generally have the lowest credit loss experience 
loans secured by personal property  such as auto loans  generally experience medium credit losses 
unsecured loan products  such as personal revolving credit  have the highest credit loss experience and for that reason  the company has chosen not to engage in a significant amount of this type of lending 
credit risk in commercial lending can vary significantly  as losses as a percentage of outstanding loans can shift widely during economic cycles and are particularly sensitive to changing economic conditions 
generally  improving economic conditions result in improved operating results on the part of commercial customers  enhancing their ability to meet their particular debt service requirements 
improvements  if any  in operating cash flows can be offset by the impact of rising interest rates that may occur during improved economic times 
declining economic conditions have an adverse affect on the operating results of commercial customers  reducing their ability to meet debt service obligations 
recent economic conditions have had a broad based impact on the company s loan portfolio as a whole 
while current economic data has shown that the mid atlantic region is outperforming most other markets in the nation  the company s is continuing to deal with the impact from the economic pressures that are being experienced by its borrowers  especially in the construction lending portfolios 
workouts of existing non performing loans and a marked decline in the migration of new problem credits resulted in a significant decline in non performing loans  particularly in the commercial real estate portfolio  from december  to december  while the diversification of the lending portfolio among different commercial  residential and consumer product lines along with different market conditions of the dc suburbs  northern virginia and baltimore metropolitan area have mitigated some of the risks in the portfolio  weakened local economic conditions and non performing loan levels may continue to be influenced by an uncertain economic recovery on both a regional and national level 
to control and manage credit risk  management has a credit process in place to ensure credit standards are maintained along with a robust in house loan administration accompanied by strong oversight and review procedures 
the primary purpose of loan underwriting is the evaluation of specific lending risks and involves the analysis of the borrower s ability to service the debt as well as the assessment of the value of the underlying collateral 
oversight and review procedures include the monitoring of portfolio credit quality  early identification of potential problem credits and the aggressive management of problem credits 
as part of the oversight and review process  the company maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance to absorb estimated and probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio 
the allowance is based on consistent  continuous review and evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio  along with ongoing  monthly assessments of the probable losses and problem credits in each portfolio 
substantially all of the fixed rate conforming residential mortgage loans originated by the company are sold in the secondary mortgage market 
concurrent with such sales  the company is required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchasers about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated 
the related sale agreements grant the purchasers recourse back to the company  which could require the company to repurchase loans or to share in any losses incurred by the purchasers 
this recourse exposure typically extends for a period of six to eighteen months after the sale of the loan 
such transactions could be due to a number of causes including borrower fraud or early payment default 
the company has seen a very limited number of repurchase and indemnity demands from purchasers for such events and routinely monitors its exposure in this regard 
the company has recorded a liability of million for possible losses due to repurchases 
given its lack of history as to losses of this type  the company believes that this reserve is adequate 
the allowance for loan and leases losses represents an estimation of the losses that are inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance is determined through careful and ongoing evaluation of the credit portfolio  and involves consideration of a number of factors  as outlined below  to establish a prudent level 
determination of the allowance is inherently subjective and requires significant estimates  including estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans and leases based on historical loss experience and consideration of current economic trends  which may be susceptible to significant change 
loans and leases deemed uncollectible are charged against the allowance  while recoveries are credited to the allowance 
management adjusts the level of the allowance through the provision for loan and lease losses  which is recorded as a current period operating expense 
the methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes the general formula allowance reflecting historical losses  as adjusted  by credit category  and the specific allowance for impaired credits on an individual or portfolio basis 
this systematic allowance methodology is further described in the section entitled critical accounting policies and in note significant accounting policies of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the amount of the allowance is reviewed and approved quarterly by the credit risk committee of the board of directors 
the company recognizes a collateral dependent lending relationship as non performing when either the loan becomes days delinquent or as a result of factors such as bankruptcy  interruption of cash flows  etc 
considered at the monthly credit committee meeting 
when a commercial loan is placed on non accrual status  it is considered to be impaired and all accrued but unpaid interest is reversed 
however  not all impaired loans are in non accrual status because they may be current with regards to the payment terms 
their determination as an impaired loan is based on some inherent weakness in the credit that may  if certain circumstances occur or arise  result in an inability to comply with the loan agreement s contractual terms 
impaired loans exclude large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment such as leases  residential real estate and consumer loans 
all payments received on non accrual loans are applied to the remaining principal balance of the loan s 
integral to the assessment of the allowance process is an evaluation that is performed to determine whether a specific reserve on a problem credit is warranted and  when losses are confirmed  a charge off is taken that is at least in the amount of the collateral deficiency as determined by an independent third party appraisal 
any further collateral deterioration results in either further specific reserves being established or additional charge offs 
at such time an action plan is agreed upon for the particular loan and an appraisal will be ordered depending on the time elapsed since the prior appraisal  the loan balance and or the result of the internal evaluation 
a current appraisal is usually obtained if the appraisal on file is more than months old 
the company s policy is to strictly adhere to regulatory appraisal standards 
if an appraisal is ordered  no more than a day turnaround is requested from the appraiser  who is selected by credit administration from an approved appraiser list 
after receipt of the updated appraisal  the assigned credit officer will recommend to the chief credit officer whether a specific reserve or a charge off should be taken 
the chief credit officer has the authority to approve a specific reserve or charge off between monthly credit committee meetings to insure that there are no significant time lapses during this process 
the company s systematic methodology for evaluating whether a loan is impaired begins with risk rating credits on an individual basis and includes consideration of the borrower s overall financial condition  resources and payment record  the sufficiency of collateral and  in a select few cases  verifiable support from financial guarantors 
the company as a consistent practice does not rely solely on the existence of guarantees when determining whether a loan is impaired and in measuring the amount of the impairment 
in measuring impairment  the company looks to the discounted cash flows of the project itself or to the value of the collateral as the primary sources of repayment of the loan 
while the company will consider the existence of guarantees and the financial strength and wherewithal of the guarantors involved in any loan relationship  it considers such guarantees only as a secondary source of repayment 
accordingly  the guarantee alone would not be sufficient to avoid classifying the loan as impaired 
management has established a credit process that dictates that structured procedures be performed to monitor these loans between the receipt of an original appraisal and the updated appraisal 
these procedures include the following an internal evaluation is updated quarterly to include borrower financial statements and or cash flow projections 
the client may be contacted for a meeting to discuss an updated or revised action plan which may include a request for additional collateral 
re verification of the documentation supporting the company s position with respect to the collateral securing the loan 
at the monthly credit committee meeting the loan may be downgraded and a specific reserve may be decided upon in advance of the receipt of the appraisal 
upon receipt of the updated appraisal or based on an updated internal financial evaluation the loan balance is compared to the appraisal and a specific reserve is decided upon for the particular loan  typically for the amount of the difference between the appraisal and the loan balance 
the company will specifically reserve for or charge off the excess of the loan amount over the amount of the appraisal 
in certain cases the company may establish a larger reserve due to knowledge of current market conditions or the existence of an offer for the collateral that will facilitate a more timely resolution of the loan 
if an updated appraisal is received subsequent to the preliminary determination of a specific reserve or partial charge off  and it is less than the initial appraisal used in the initial charge off  an additional specific reserve or charge off is taken on the related credit 
partially charged off loans are not written back up based on updated appraisals and always remain on non accrual with any and all subsequent payments applied to the remaining balance of the loan as principal reductions 
no interest income is recognized on loans that have been partially charged off 
loans may have their terms restructured eg  interest rates  loan maturity date  payment and amortization period  etc 
in circumstances that provide payment relief to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty 
all restructured loans are considered impaired loans and may either be in accruing status or non accruing status 
non accruing restructured loans may return to accruing status provided there is a sufficient period of payment performance in accordance with the restructure terms 
loans may be removed from the restructured category in the year subsequent to the restructuring if their revised loans terms are considered to be consistent with terms that can be obtained in the credit market for loans with comparable risk 
the company generally follows a policy of not extending maturities on non performing loans under existing terms 
the company may extend the maturity of a performing or current loan that may have some inherent weakness associated with the loan 
maturity date extensions only occur under terms that clearly place the company in a position to increase or assure full collection of the loan under the contractual terms and or terms at the time of the extension that may eliminate or mitigate the inherent weakness in the loan 
these terms may incorporate  but are not limited to additional assignment of collateral  significant balance curtailments liquidations and assignments of additional project cash flows 
guarantees may be a consideration in the extension of loan maturities  but the company does not extend loans based solely on guarantees 
as a general matter  the company does not view extension of a loan to be a satisfactory approach to resolving non performing credits 
on an exception basis  certain performing loans that have displayed some inherent weakness in the underlying collateral values  an inability to comply with certain loan covenants which are not affecting the performance of the credit or other identified weakness may be extended collateral values or estimates of discounted cash flows inclusive of any potential cash flow from guarantees are evaluated to estimate the probability and severity of potential losses 
then a specific amount of impairment is established based on the company s calculation of the probable loss inherent in the individual loan 
the actual occurrence and severity of losses involving impaired credits can differ substantially from estimates 
management believes that it uses relevant information available to make determinations about whether a loan is impaired in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
however  the determination of impairment requires significant judgment  and estimates of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  and independent consultants engaged by the company  periodically review the loan and lease portfolio 
these reviews may result in additional loans being considered impaired based on management s judgments of information available at the time of each examination 
the company makes provisions for loan and lease losses in amounts necessary to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level  as established by use of the allowance methodology discussed above 
provisions amounted to million in  million in and million in  respectively 
net charge offs of million  million and million  were recorded in  and  respectively 
this resulted in a ratio of annualized net charge offs to average loans and leases of in  in and in at december   the allowance for loan and lease losses was million  or of total loans and leases  compared to million  or of total loans and leases  at december  management believes that the allowance is adequate 
however  its determination requires significant judgment  and estimates of probable losses in the loan and lease portfolio can vary significantly from the amounts actually observed 
while management uses available information to recognize probable losses  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in the credits comprising the portfolio and changes in the financial condition of borrowers  such as may result from changes in economic conditions 
in addition  federal and state regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  and independent consultants engaged by the bank  periodically review the loan and lease portfolio and the allowance 
such reviews may result in adjustments to the provision based upon their analysis of the information available at the time of each examination 
the following table presents a five year history for the allocation of the allowance for loan and leases losses 
the allowance is allocated in the following table to various loan and lease categories based on the methodology used to estimate loan losses  however  the allocation does not restrict the usage of the allowance for any specific loan or lease category 
allowance for loan and lease losses december  in thousands residential real estate residential mortgage residential construction total residential real estate commercial real estate commercial mortgage commercial construction total commercial real estate commercial business leases consumer total allowance during  there were no major changes in estimation methods that affected the allowance methodology from the prior year 
variations can occur over time in the methodology s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance as a result of the credit performance of borrowers 
there was no unallocated allowance at year end or  when measured against the total allowance 
at december   total non performing loans and leases were million  or of total loans and leases  compared to million  or of total loans and leases  at december  the decrease in non performing loans and leases was due primarily to a decrease of million in nonaccrual loans and leases 
timely aggressive recognition and management of problem credits has significantly slowed the migration of these loans into non accrual status during this period 
the decrease in non performing loans was due in large part to a decrease of million in balances relating to six commercial relationships which included net charge offs of million and payments of million 
these relationships encompass loans in the commercial construction  commercial real estate and commercial business loan categories 
none of these loans have had their maturities extended and only one million loan has had the terms restructured since origination 
credit issues for home builders have been identified  workout strategies have been developed and the company continues to monitor the performance of the underlying collateral  and to update appraisals  as necessary  given the context of market environment expectations 
the allowance represented of non performing loans and leases at december  and at december  the movement in the coverage ratio demonstrates the improvement in the allowance position 
this increase in the coverage ratio is the direct result of a declining level of non performing loans 
an analysis of the actual loss history on the problem credits in and provided an indication that the coverage of the inherent losses on the problem credits was adequate 
the company continues to monitor the impact of the economic conditions on our commercial customers  the reduced inflow of non accruals  lower inflow in criticized loan and the significant decline in early stage delinquencies 
the improvement in these credit metrics support management s outlook for continued improved credit quality performance 
the balance of impaired loans was million  with specific reserves of million against those loans at december   as compared to million with reserves of million  at december  the decrease in specific reserves during this period of time was the direct result of the resolution by either charge off or pay down of several problem credits 
the company borrowers are concentrated in six counties in maryland and two counties in virginia 
commercial and residential mortgages  including home equity loans and lines  represented of total loans and leases at december   compared to at december  certain loan terms may create concentrations of credit risk and increase the lender s exposure to loss 
these include terms that permit the deferral of principal payments or payments that are smaller than normal interest accruals negative amortization  loans with high loan to value ratios  loans  such as option adjustable rate mortgages  that may expose the borrower to future increases in repayments that are in excess of increases that would result solely from increases in market interest rates  and interest only loans 
the company does not make loans that provide for negative amortization 
the company originates option adjustable rate mortgages infrequently and sells all of them in the secondary market

market risk management the company net income is largely dependent on its net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to interest rate risk to the extent that interest bearing liabilities mature or re price on a different basis than interest earning assets 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or re price more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest could adversely affect net interest income 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or re price more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates could result in a decrease in net interest income 
net interest income is also affected by changes in the portion of interest earning assets that are funded by interest bearing liabilities rather than by other sources of funds  such as noninterest bearing deposits and stockholders equity 
the company s interest rate risk management goals are to increase net interest income at a growth rate consistent with the growth rate of total assets  and to minimize fluctuations in net interest margin as a percentage of earning assets 
management attempts to achieve these goals by balancing  within policy limits  the volume of floating rate liabilities with a similar volume of floating rate assets  by keeping the average maturity of fixed rate asset and liability contracts reasonably matched  by maintaining a pool of administered core deposits  and by adjusting pricing rates to market conditions on a continuing basis 
the company s board of directors has established a comprehensive interest rate risk management policy  which is administered by management s alco 
the policy establishes limits on risk  which are quantitative measures of the percentage change in net interest income a measure of net interest income at risk and the fair value of equity capital a measure of economic value of equity or eve at risk resulting from a hypothetical change in us treasury interest rates for maturities from one day to thirty years 
the company measures the potential adverse impacts that changing interest rates may have on its short term earnings  long term value  and liquidity by employing simulation analysis through the use of computer modeling 
the simulation model captures optionality factors such as call features and interest rate caps and floors imbedded in investment and loan portfolio contracts 
as with any method of gauging interest rate risk  there are certain shortcomings inherent in the interest rate modeling methodology used by the company 
when interest rates change  actual movements in different categories of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  loan prepayments  and withdrawals of time and other deposits  may deviate significantly from assumptions used in the model 
finally  the methodology does not measure or reflect the impact that higher rates may have on adjustable rate loan customers ability to service their debts  or the impact of rate changes on demand for loan  lease  and deposit products 
the company prepares a current base case and eight alternative simulations at least once a quarter  and reports the analysis to the board of directors 
in addition  more frequent forecasts are produced when interest rates are particularly uncertain or when other business conditions so dictate 
the statement of condition is subject to quarterly testing for eight alternative interest rate shock possibilities to indicate the inherent interest rate risk 
average interest rates are shocked by    and basis points bp  although the company may elect not to use particular scenarios that it determines are impractical in a current rate environment 
it is management s goal to structure the balance sheet so that net interest earnings at risk over a twelve month period and the economic value of equity at risk do not exceed policy guidelines at the various interest rate shock levels 
the company augments its quarterly interest rate shock analysis with alternative external interest rate scenarios on a monthly basis 
these alternative interest rate scenarios may include non parallel rate ramps and non parallel yield curve twists 
if a measure of risk produced by the alternative simulations of the entire balance sheet violates policy guidelines  alco is required to develop a plan to restore the measure of risk to a level that complies with policy limits within two quarters 
measures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution s short term performance in alternative rate environments 
these measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period  usually one year 
they do not necessarily indicate the long term prospects or economic value of the institution 
estimated changes in net interest income estimated changes in net interest income change in interest rates bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp policy limit december  n a n a n a n a december  n a n a n a n a as shown above  measures of net interest income at risk decreased from december  at all interest rate shock levels 
all measures remained well within prescribed policy limits 
the risk position decreased substantially in the rising rate scenarios due to a lengthening of durations in deposits and borrowings which offset the longer duration of the investment portfolio  resulting in a larger asset sensitive gap position 
as rates were shocked up  interest expense did not increase appreciably due to the growth in noninterest bearing demand deposit  regular savings and now accounts whose rates are administered by management and thus less subject to interest rate movements 
further  it is assumed that the lower market rates at year end will cause fewer fhlb convertible advances to be called in the up shock scenarios  thus limiting any further increase in interest expense 
the measures of equity value at risk indicate the ongoing economic value of the company by considering the effects of changes in interest rates on all of the company s cash flows  and by discounting the cash flows to estimate the present value of assets and liabilities 
the difference between these discounted values of the assets and liabilities is the economic value of equity  which  in theory  approximates the fair value of the company s net assets 
estimated changes in economic value of equity eve estimated changes in economic value of equity eve change in interest rates bp bp bp bp bp bp bp bp policy limit december  n a n a n a n a december  n a n a n a n a measures of the economic value of equity eve at risk decreased compared to year end in all interest rate shock levels except the bp level 
the economic value of equity exposure at bp is now compared to at year end  and is well within the policy limit of  as are measures at all other shock levels 
during  the company s core deposit premium has increased due primarily to longer durations and increased balances in noninterest bearing demand deposit  regular savings and now accounts 
this has caused a generally positive impact to eve in the rising shock bands as those funds provide additional premium in a rising rate environment due to the assumption that such rates will lag the pace of increase in overall market rates 
in addition  the company s equity position increased over due to its common stock offering in and positive earnings 
liquidity management liquidity is measured by a financial institution ability to raise funds through loan and lease repayments  maturing investments  deposit growth  borrowed funds  capital and the sale of highly marketable assets such as investment securities and residential mortgage loans 
the company liquidity position  considering both internal and external sources available  exceeded anticipated short term and long term needs at december  management considers core deposits  defined to include all deposits other than time deposits of thousand or more  to be a relatively stable funding source 
core deposits equaled of total earning assets at december  in addition  loan and lease payments  maturities  calls and pay downs of securities  deposit growth and earnings contribute a flow of funds available to meet liquidity requirements 
in assessing liquidity  management considers operating requirements  the seasonality of deposit flows  investment  loan and deposit maturities and calls  expected funding of loans and deposit withdrawals  and the market values of available for sale investments  so that sufficient funds are available on short notice to meet obligations as they arise and to ensure that the company is able to pursue new business opportunities 
liquidity is measured using an approach designed to take into account  in addition to factors already discussed above  the company s growth and mortgage banking activities 
also considered are changes in the liquidity of the investment portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 
under this approach  implemented by the funds management subcommittee of alco under formal policy guidelines  the company s liquidity position is measured weekly  looking forward at thirty day intervals from thirty to three hundred sixty days 
the measurement is based upon the projection of funds sold or purchased position  along with ratios and trends developed to measure dependence on purchased funds and core growth 
resulting projections as of december   show short term investments exceeding short term borrowings by million over the subsequent days 
this projected excess of liquidity versus requirements provides the company with flexibility in how it funds loans and other earning assets 
the company also has external sources of funds  which can be drawn upon when required 
the main sources of external liquidity are available lines of credit with the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the federal reserve 
the line of credit with the federal home loan bank of atlanta totaled billion  of which million was available for borrowing based on pledged collateral  with million borrowed against it as of december  the line of credit at the federal reserve totaled million  all of which was available for borrowing based on pledged collateral  with no borrowings against it as of december  other external sources of liquidity available to the company in the form of unsecured lines of credit granted by correspondent banks totaled million at december   against which there were no outstanding borrowings 
in addition  the company had a secured line of credit with a correspondent bank of million as of december  based upon its liquidity analysis  including external sources of liquidity available  management believes the liquidity position was appropriate at december  the parent company bancorp is a separate legal entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
in addition to its operating expenses  bancorp is responsible for paying any dividends declared to its common shareholders  dividends on its preferred stock  and interest and principal on outstanding debt 
bancorp s primary source of income is dividends received from the bank 
the amount of dividends that the bank may declare and pay to bancorp in any calendar year  without the receipt of prior approval from the federal reserve  cannot exceed net income for that year to date plus retained net income as defined for the preceding two calendar years 
based on this requirement  as of december   the bank could have declared a dividend of million to bancorp 
at december   bancorp had liquid assets of million
