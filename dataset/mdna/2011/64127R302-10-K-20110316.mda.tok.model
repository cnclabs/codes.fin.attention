in addition  any statements that refer to projections of our future financial performance  our anticipated growth and trends in our businesses  and other characterizations of future events or circumstances are forward looking statements 
such statements are based on our current expectations and could be affected by the uncertainties and risk factors described throughout this filing and particularly in the overview and trends outlook section see also risk factors in part i  item a of this annual report 
our actual results may differ materially 
overview we are focused on the development and commercialization of treatments based on transplanting human neural stem cells and small molecule compounds 
we have developed and maintain a portfolio of patents and patent applications that form the proprietary base for our research and development efforts in the area of neural stem cell research 
we own or exclusively license sixteen issued patents and twenty nine patent pending applications in the field of regenerative medicine and related technologies 
we believe our technology base  in combination with our know how  and collaborative projects with major research institutions  provide a competitive advantage and will facilitate the development and commercialization of products for use in the treatment of a wide array of neurodegenerative conditions and in regenerative repair of acute disease 
regenerative medicine is a young and emerging field 
regenerative medicine is the process of creating living  functional tissues to repair or replace tissue or organ function lost due to age  disease  damage  or congenital defects 
there can be no assurances that our intellectual property portfolio will ultimately produce viable commercialized products and processes 
even if we are able to produce a commercially viable product  there are strong competitors in this field and our products may not be able to successfully compete against them 
all of our research efforts to date are at the pre clinical or clinical stage of development 
we are focused on leveraging our key assets  including our intellectual property  our scientific team and our facilities  to advance our technologies 
in addition  we are pursuing strategic collaborations with members of academia 
research we have devoted substantial resources to our research programs in order to isolate and develop a series of neural stem cell banks that we believe can serve as a basis for our therapeutic products 
our efforts to date have been directed at methods to identify  isolate and culture large varieties of stem cells of the human nervous system  and to develop therapies utilizing these stem cells 
this research is conducted internally  through the use of third party laboratories and consulting companies under our direct supervision  and through collaboration with academic institutes 
operating strategy we employ an outsourcing strategy where we outsource all of our good laboratory practices glp preclinical development activities and gmp manufacturing and clinical development activities to contract research organizations cro and contract manufacturing organizations cmo as well as all non critical corporate functions 
manufacturing is also outsourced to organizations with approved facilities and manufacturing practices 
this outsource model allows us to better manage cash on hand and eliminates non vital expenditures 
it also allows for us to operate with relatively fewer employees and lower fixed costs than that required by our competitors 
trends outlook revenue in november  we were awarded three federal grants  totaling  through the patient protection and affordable care act  we had no other revenues for the year ended december  our focus is on i successfully managing our two sponsored clinical trial  and ii preparing for the initiation of our ind relating to chronic spinal cord injury 
we are also pursuing pre clinical studies on other central nervous system indications in preparation for additional clinical trials 
we are not focused at this time on generating revenues 
long term  we anticipate our revenue will be derived primarily from licensing fees and sales of our cell based therapy and small molecule compounds 
because we are at such an early stage in the clinical trials process  we are not yet able to accurately predict when we will have a product ready for commercialization  if ever 
in november  we were awarded three federal grants  totaling  through the patient protection and affordable care act  which supports investments in qualifying therapeutic discovery projects 
the funding will help us move our small molecule treatment for depression into the clinic  and advance our ongoing trial to treat als with our spinal cord stem cells 
the third grant will go to developing our igf expressing neural stem cell therapy product  which could also target als 
in this program  we are focused on engineering our spinal cord neurons to over express molecules of interest  such as igf insulin like growth factor 
as of december   we have received  of the grant 
we expect to receive the balance of the funds during the first quarter of these are one time grants 
research development expenses our research and development costs consist of expenses incurred in identifying  developing and testing treatments for central nervous system diseases 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers and academic collaborators for research  testing  contract manufacturing  costs of facilities  and the preparation of regulatory applications and reports 
we focus on the development of treatment candidates with potential uses in multiple indications  and use employee and infrastructure resources across several projects 
accordingly  many of our costs are not attributable to a specifically identified product and we do not account for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in the future  as funding allows 
to the extent that it is practical  we will continue to outsource much of our efforts  including product manufacture  proof of principle and preclinical testing  toxicology  tumorigenicity  dosing rationale  and development of clinical protocol and ind applications 
this approach allows us to use the best expertise available for each task and permits staging new research projects to fit available cash resources 
we have formed a wholly owned subsidiary in the people s republic of china this subsidiary will primarily conduct research with regard to stem cells 
clinical trials stem cells our top development priority is our ongoing clinical trial for als at emory university in atlanta 
we estimate that the phase i trial for als will require patients at an estimated cost of  per patient 
the per patient cost includes the costs of the operation to administer our spinal cord cells  post operation treatment for the patient  emory university s charges for running the trial and third party trial monitoring and data collection 
our spending on an individual patient will be spread over the life of the trial as the majority of our costs are incurred after the patient has been operated on 
we expect trial spending to gradually decrease to  per month after a number of patients have been treated 
to date  we have treated patients 
it is still too early in the trials to make any determination as to its level of success  if any 
on august   we filed our second ind with the fda 
the ind is being filed in connection with our proposed phase i clinical trials for chronic spinal cord injury 
as of the date of this report  the fda has not approved our ind 
small molecule compounds in december of  the fda approved our ind application to initiate a phase i a safety trial to test nsi  our first small molecule compound  for the treatment of major depression 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative g a expenses consist of the general costs  expenses and salaries for the operation and maintenance of our business 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase as we progress from a pre clinical to clinical phase of development 
additionally  commencing with our fiscal year  we will no longer qualify as a smaller reporting company 
as a result  we will incur additional costs and expenses with regard to our legal and financial compliance  including compliance with section b of the sarbanes oxley act of we anticipate that as a result of our outsource model  our g a expenses related to our core business will increase at a slower rate than that of similar companies 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of the notes to financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and present a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements use of estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and  accordingly  require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
specifically  our management has estimated the expected economic life and value of our licensed technology  our net operating loss for tax purposes and our stock option and warrant expenses related to compensation to employees and directors  consultants and investment banks 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition in november  we were awarded three federal grants  totaling  through the patient protection and affordable care act  we had no other revenues for the year ended december  we had no revenues for the year ended december  our revenues  to date  have been derived primarily from providing treated samples for gene expression data from stem cell experiments and from providing services as a subcontractor under federal grant programs 
revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery of goods and services has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured and will be affected by particular transactions we may enter into in the future 
to date  we have had only grant revenue 
intangible and long lived assets we follow fasb guidelines related to the accounting for impairment of long lived assets  which established a primary asset approach to determine the cash flow estimation period for a group of assets and liabilities that represents the unit of accounting for a long lived asset to be held and used 
long lived assets to be held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
during the years ending december  and  no impairment losses were recognized 
accounting for warrants we have adopted fasb guidance related to determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
this guidance applies to any freestanding financial instruments or embedded features that have the characteristics of a derivative  as defined by the fasb  and to any freestanding financial instruments that are potentially settled in an entity s own common stock 
as a result  certain of our warrants are considered to be derivatives and must be valued using various assumptions as they are recorded as liabilities 
research and development costs research and development costs consist of expenditures for the research and development of patents and technology  which are not capitalizable and charged to operations when incurred 
our research and development costs consist mainly of payroll and payroll related expenses  research supplies and costs incurred in connection with specific research grants 
stock based compensation the company accounts for equity instruments issued to non employees in accordance with guidance issued by fasb 
accordingly  the estimated fair value of the equity instrument is recorded on the earlier of the performance commitment date or the date the services required are completed 
we recognized  and  in stock based compensation expense for the years ended december  and  respectively 
results of operations revenue in november  we were awarded three federal grants  totaling  through the patient protection and affordable care act  which supports investments in qualifying therapeutic discovery projects 
as of december   we have received  of the grant 
we received the balance of the funds during the first quarter of these are one time grants 
the company did not have revenues for the twelve months ended december  operating expenses operating expenses totaled  in and  in change in twelve months ended dec 
 versus operating expenses research development general administrative expense depreciation and amortization total expense research and development expenses our r d expenses consist primarily of contractors charges and personnel expenses associated with clinical trials and regulatory submissions  costs associated with preclinical activities such as proof of principle for new indications  toxicology studies  costs associated with cell processing and process development  facilities related costs and supplies 
clinical trial expenses include payments to research organizations  contract manufacturers  clinical trial sites  laboratories for testing clinical samples and consultants 
research and development expenses totaled  in  compared to  in the increase of  or  from to was primarily attributable to the costs in of beginning clinical trials for als  completing the application to the fda to begin clinical trials on our small molecule compound ns for depression and our stem cells for chronic spinal cord injury  and the development of proof of principle for new applications for our stem cells 
of the  increase in r d spending   was attributable to increased spending on external contractors 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses are primarily comprised of legal fees  salaries  benefits and other costs associated with  finance  legal  human resources  information technology  public relations  facilities and other external general and administrative services 
g a expenses totaled  in  compared with  in the increase of  or  from to was primarily attributable to increased litigation expenses and non cash stock based compensation 
these two categories accounted for  of the expenses increase 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses totaled  in  compared with  in the increase of  or from to was primarily attributed to fixed asset and higher amortization of patents resulting from more patent additions over the past year 
nonoperating expense income nonoperating expense income totaled  and  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the nonoperating income or expense is discussed below 
twelve months ended december  nonoperating income interest income interest expense warrant issuance and modification expense loss gain on change in fair value adjustment of warrant obligations total nonoperating expense income interest income totaled  in compared to  in the increase of  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the comparable period in was attributable to higher cash balances  offset by reduced interest rates on short term savings 
interest expense was  in and in the increase in as compared to was attributable to the short term financing of some insurance costs 
the company had a warrant modification expense of  in details of the transaction are in note to the financial statements 
on january  we reclassified the fair value of common stock purchase warrants  which have exercise price reset and anti liquidation features  from equity to liability status  as if these warrants were treated as a derivative liability since their date of issue 
we established a warrant liability of million to recognize the fair value of such warrants 
in the twelve months ended december   the fair value of these common stock purchase warrants decreased to  in the twelve months ended december   we converted  redeemed or modified more than of the warrants that were outstanding at the beginning of the year which had price protection features 
these modifications removed the price protection features 
these modifications also reduced the company s derivative liability to  at december  an increase in the company s stock price resulted in an expense for the period of liquidity and capital resources since our inception  we have financed our operations through the private placement of our securities  the exercise of investor warrants  and to a lesser degree from grants 
currently  our monthly cash burn rate is approximately  in the event our second ind is accepted by the fda and we elect to commence the trials  we expect our monthly cash burn rate will increase to approximately million 
we estimate that we will have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to finance our current operations  pre clinical and clinical work for at least months from december   assuming we do not commence our second ind 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to secure additional financing after such time 
several factors will affect our ability to raise additional funding  including  but not limited to  the volatility of our common shares and general market conditions 
we anticipate that our available cash and expected income will be sufficient to finance our current activities for at least the next months from december   although certain activities and related personnel may need to be reduced 
change in twelve months ended december  versus cash and cash equivalents net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities total cash and cash equivalents was  at december   compared with  at december  the increase in our cash and cash equivalents of  or  from december  to december  was primarily attributable to the exercise of outstanding warrants and the registered offering of our securities during the twelve months ending december  net cash used in operating activities operating activities required  for the twelve months ended december  compared to  for the same period in the increase of  in cash consumption  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to the initiation of our clinical trials and increase in legal expenses 
net cash used in investing activities we used  of cash in connection with investment activities for the twelve months ended december  and  in the increase in our cash use of  or  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in was primarily attributable to an increase in purchases of equipment during the year  as well as additional patent work 
net cash provided by financing activities we raised  and  in net proceeds from the issuance of our securities during the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
listed below are key financing transactions entered into by us during on january   we received gross proceeds of  as a result of the exercise of  series d warrant exercises 
we issued the holder of the d warrants  additional warrants with an exercise price of in conjunction with the exercise 
the new warrants have a life of one year 
in february of  we called our series b warrants 
gross exercise proceeds totaled  in march of  holders of  series c warrants exercised their option to purchase our common stock for per share 
gross proceeds totaled  we issued the holders of the exercised c warrants  additional warrants with an exercise price of and a life of years in conjunction with the exercise 
the holder of  placement agent warrants exercised them in march of gross consideration totaled  we issued the holder of the exercised placement agent warrants  additional warrants with an exercise price of and a life of years in conjunction with the exercise 
in june of  we sold approximately  units  through a registered direct offering 
each unit consists of one common share and common share purchase warrant 
each unit was sold for 
each warrant has an exercise price of per share  and is exercisable for a period of three years 
as a result of the offering  we received gross proceeds of approximately million  and net proceeds of  in the period january through december  series a warrant holders exercised an aggregate of  warrants 
the exercise price of the series a warrants is per share 
as a result of the exercises  we received gross proceeds of  in november  we filed a prospectus supplement that relates to the issuance and sale of up to  of our common stock  from time to time through a sales agreement with our sales agent stifel  nicolaus company  incorporated 
the prospectus is a part of a registration statement that we filed with the sec on october   using a shelf registration process 
under this shelf registration process  we may offer to sell in one or more offerings up to a total dollar amount of  in  we had no sales of our common stock under this sales agreement with stifel  nicolaus company  incorporated 
stifel  nicolaus company  incorporated will be paid compensation equal to of the gross proceeds pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
in the fourth quarter of  holders of  stand alone warrants  with strike prices between and  exercised them for total net proceeds of  the company incurred placement agent commissions for the exercise of series a  b  and c warrants  which total  call of series b warrants during the first quarter of  we issued an aggregate of  series b warrants in connection with a private placement of our securities 
the series b warrants contained a call provision allowing us to redeem the warrants for 
per warrant share  upon days notice  provided the following two conditions were met a we receive approval of our ind  and b a registration statement covering the resale of the warrant shares shall be effective 
as a result  series b warrant holders exercised their respective warrants in the first quarter  which resulted in us issuing  common shares and receiving gross proceeds in the amount of  future liquidity needs we have incurred significant operating losses and negative cash flows since inception 
we have not achieved profitability and may not be able to realize sufficient revenue to achieve or sustain profitability in the future 
we do not expect to be profitable in the next several years  but rather expect to incur additional operating losses 
we have limited liquidity and capital resources and must obtain significant additional capital resources in order to sustain our product development efforts  for acquisition of technologies and intellectual property rights  for preclinical and clinical testing of our anticipated products  pursuit of regulatory approvals  acquisition of capital equipment  laboratory and office facilities  establishment of production capabilities  for general and administrative expenses and other working capital requirements 
we rely on cash balances and the proceeds from the offering of our securities  exercise of outstanding warrants and grants to fund our operations 
we intend to pursue opportunities to obtain additional financing in the future through the sale of our securities and additional research grants 
on october  we filed a shelf registration statement registering the sale of up to million of our securities 
the registration statement was declared effective on october  we anticipate conducting financing in the future based on our shelf registration statement when and if financing opportunities arise 
the source  timing and availability of any future financing will depend principally upon market conditions  interest rates and  more specifically  on our progress in our exploratory  preclinical and future clinical development programs 
funding may not be available when needed at all  or on terms acceptable to us 
lack of necessary funds may require us  among other things  to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and product development programs  planned clinical trials  and or our capital expenditures or to license our potential products or technologies to third parties
