the aggregate consideration for the acquisition includes i approximately million in cash  ii  unregistered shares of common stock with a fair value of approximately million iii approximately million of deferred cash payments over a month period beginning june  and iv approximately million in assumed liabilities 
the acquisition of pipeline was a business combination accounted for under the acquisition method 
characteristics of our revenues and expenses we offer our services under agreements having terms of one  two or three years 
pursuant to these agreements  we bill customers on a monthly basis  in advance  for each month of service 
payments received in advance of services performed are recorded as deferred revenues and recognized as revenue ratably over the service period 
costs of revenues consists of expenses that are directly related to providing services to our customers  including core network expenses tower and roof rent expense and utilities  bandwidth costs  points of presence pop maintenance and other and customer network expenses customer maintenance  non installation fees and other customer specific expenses 
we collectively refer to core network and customer network as our network  and core network costs and customer network costs as network costs 
when we first enter a new market  or expand in an existing market  we are required to incur up front costs in order to be able to provide wireless broadband services to commercial customers 
we refer to these activities as establishing a network presence 
these costs include building pops which are company locations where we install a substantial amount of equipment in order to connect numerous customers to the internet 
the costs to build pops are capitalized and expensed over a five year period 
in addition to building pops  we also enter tower and roof rental agreements  secure bandwidth and incur other network costs 
once we have established a network presence in a new market or expanded our network presence in an existing market  we are capable of servicing a significant number of customers through that network presence 
the variable cost to add new customers is relatively modest  especially compared to the upfront cost of establishing or expanding our network presence 
as a result  our gross margins in a market normally increase over time as we add new customers in that market 
however  we may experience variability in gross margins during periods in which we are expanding our network presence in a market 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of the salaries  benefits  travel and other costs of our sales and marketing teams  as well as marketing initiatives and business development expenses 
customer support services includes salaries and related payroll costs associated with our customer support services  customer care  and installation and operations staff

salaries and other related payroll costs for executive management  finance  administration and information systems personnel are included in this category 
other costs include rent  utilities and other facility costs  accounting  legal and other professional services  and other general operating expenses 
market information we operate in one segment which is the business of wireless broadband services 
although we provide services in multiple markets  these operations have been aggregated into one reportable segment based on the similar economic characteristics among all markets  including the nature of the services provided and the type of customers purchasing such services 
while we operate in only one business segment  we recognize that providing information on the revenues and costs of operating in each market can provide useful information to investors regarding our operating performance 
as of december   we operated in eleven markets across the united states including new york  boston  los angeles  chicago  san francisco  miami  seattle  dallas fort worth  philadelphia  nashville and providence 
the markets were launched at different times  and as a result  may have different operating metrics based on their size and stage of maturation 
we incur significant up front costs in order to establish a network presence in a new market 
these costs include building pops and network costs 
other material costs include hiring and training sales and marketing personnel who will be dedicated to securing customers in that market 
once we have established a network presence in a new market  we are capable of servicing a significant number of customers 
the rate of customer additions varies from market to market  and we are unable to predict how many customers will be added in a market during any specific period 
we believe that providing operating information regarding each of our markets provides useful information to shareholders in understanding the leveraging potential of our business model  the operating performance of our mature markets  and the long term potential for our newer markets 
set forth below is a summary of our operating performance on a per market basis  and a description of how each category is determined 
revenues revenues are allocated based on which market each customer is located in 
costs of revenues includes payroll  core network costs and customer network costs that can be specifically allocated to a specific market 
costs that can not be allocated to a specific market are classified as centralized costs 
operating costs costs which can be specifically allocated to a market include direct sales personnel  certain direct marketing expenses  certain customer support and installation payroll expenses and third party commissions 
centralized costs represents costs incurred to support activities across all of our markets that are not allocable to a specific market 
this principally consists of payroll costs for customer care representatives  customer support engineers  sales support  marketing and certain installations personnel 
these individuals service customers across all markets rather than being dedicated to any specific market 
corporate expenses includes costs attributable to corporate overhead and the overall support of our operations 
salaries and related payroll costs for executive management  finance  administration and information systems personnel are included in this category 
other costs include office rent  utilities and other facilities costs  professional services and other general operating expenses

impact of inflation  changing prices and economic conditions pricing for many technology products and services have historically decreased over time due to the effect of product and process improvements and enhancements 
in addition  economic conditions can affect the buying patterns of customers 
during most of  the impact of the long economic recession caused many of our prospective customers to continue to either delay their buying decision or to purchase lower bandwidth services than normal 
in addition  the number of general pricing levels for internet services declined modestly during the year 
during the fourth quarter  customers began to increase their bandwidth purchases which resulted in a increase in arpu of new customers compared to the average for the first three quarters of the year 
in addition  the number of customer upgrades to higher bandwidth  which also increases arpu  increased by more than during the second half of as compared to the same period in we believe that our customers will continue to upgrade their bandwidth service if economic conditions improve and their internet requirements increase 
the continued migration of many business activities and functions to the internet  and the growing use of cloud computing  should also result in increased bandwidth requirements over the long term 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and the amounts of revenues and expenses 
critical accounting policies are those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods 
in preparing the financial statements  we utilized available information  including our past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming our estimates and judgments  giving appropriate consideration to materiality 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations to other companies in our industry 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and estimation  or are fundamentally important to our business 
revenue recognition 
we normally enter into contractual agreements with our customers for periods ranging between one to three years 
we recognize the total revenue provided under a contract ratably over the contract period  including any periods under which we have agreed to provide services at no cost 
deferred revenues are recognized as a liability when billings are issued in advance of the date when revenues are earned 
we apply the revenue recognition principles set forth under securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  sab which provides for revenue to be recognized when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery or installation has been completed  iii the customer accepts and verifies receipt  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
long lived assets 
long lived assets with definitive lives consist primarily of property and equipment  and intangible assets 
long lived assets are evaluated periodically for impairment or whenever events or circumstances indicate their carrying value may not be recoverable 
conditions that would result in an impairment charge include a significant decline in the fair value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used  or a significant adverse change that would indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets is not recoverable 
when such events or circumstances arise  an estimate of the future undiscounted cash flows produced by the asset  or the appropriate grouping of assets  is compared to the asset s carrying value to determine if impairment exists 
if the asset is determined to be impaired  the impairment loss is measured based on the excess of its carrying value over its fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value or net realizable value 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in an acquisition 
goodwill is not amortized but rather is reviewed annually for impairment  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
a two step test is performed at the reporting unit level to assess goodwill for impairment 
first  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  the reporting unit is not impaired and no further testing is performed 
the second step is performed if the carrying value exceeds the fair value 
if the carrying value of the goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference will be recorded 
asset retirement obligations 
the financial accounting standards board s fasb guidance on asset retirement obligations addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated costs 
this guidance requires the recognition of an asset retirement obligation and an associated asset retirement cost when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
our network equipment is installed on both buildings in which we have a lease agreement company locations and at customer locations 
in both instances  the installation and removal of our equipment is not complicated and does not require structural changes to the building where the equipment is installed 
costs associated with the removal of our equipment at company or customer locations are not material  and accordingly  we have determined that we do not presently have asset retirement obligations under the fasb s accounting guidance 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements  financings  or other relationships with unconsolidated entities known as special purposes entities 
recent accounting pronouncements the fasb has issued accounting standards update asu  business combinations topic disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations 
this amendment affects any public entity as defined by topic  business combinations that enters into business combinations that are material on an individual or aggregate basis 
the comparative financial statements should present and disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination s that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only 
the amendments also expand the supplemental pro forma disclosures to include a description of the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to the business combination included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
the amendments are effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
asu modifies step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts by requiring an entity to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
this update will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations
