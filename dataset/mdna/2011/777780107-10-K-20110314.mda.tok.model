components of our statement of operations revenue we derive revenue from sales of language learning solutions consisting of packaged software and audio practice products and online software subscriptions

rosetta stone version totale  which was released in september  combines packaged software and dedicated conversational coaching 
the content of our packaged software and subscription offerings are the same 
we simply offer our customers the ability to choose which format they prefer without differentiating the learning experience 
we began bundling time based subscription licenses of our web based totale services with perpetual licenses of our rosetta stone version language learning solutions in the us consumer market as part of our rosetta stone version totale launch 
as a result  we defer approximately of each of these bundled sales over the term of the subscription license 

table of contents we sell our solutions directly to individuals  educational institutions  armed forces  government agencies and corporations 
we distribute our consumer products predominantly through our direct sales channels  primarily our websites and call centers  which we refer to as our direct to consumer channel 
we also distribute our consumer products through our kiosks  which we own  as well as through select retailers 
the majority of our consumer customers purchase our packaged software and audio practice products  online software subscriptions and professional services 
we sell to institutions primarily through our direct institutional sales force 
many institutions elect to license our products on a subscription basis 
for purposes of explaining variances in our revenue  we separately discuss changes in our consumer and institutional sales channels because the customers and revenue drivers of these channels are different 
we anticipate that revenue growth in will slow and revenue associated with the us consumer business may decline 
for the year ended december   we reclassified our home school sales vertical from institutional to consumer 
we believe the drivers of acquiring a home school customer are more aligned with a typical sale in our consumer sales vertical 
prior year information has been modified to conform to current year presentation 
this presentation is also consistent with how we manage the home school channel 
our consumer revenue is affected by seasonal trends associated with the holiday shopping season 
as a result  our fourth quarter ended december  accounted for of our annual revenue in our institutional revenue is seasonally stronger in the second and third quarters of the calendar year due to education and government purchasing cycles 
we expect these trends to continue

such costs include packaging materials  computer headsets  freight  inventory receiving  personnel costs associated with product assembly  third party royalty fees and inventory storage  obsolescence and shrinkage

we also include the cost of credit card processing and customer technical support in both cost of product revenue and cost of subscription and service revenue 
cost of revenue will also increase as a percentage of revenue in future periods as a result of our launch of rosetta stone version totale  which includes services that have higher direct costs to deliver to customers than our existing software solutions

table of contents an office in germany

we intend to continue to expand our sales activities within these regions as well as to expand our presence into new countries  in addition to expanding our media and advertising campaigns in the united states 
as a result  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in future periods 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and contract development fees associated with the development of our solutions 
our development efforts are primarily based in the united states and are devoted to expanding our product portfolio through the addition of new content and new complimentary products and services to our language learning solutions 
we expect our investment in research and development expenses to increase in future years but provide us with significant benefits in the future 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs of our executive  finance  legal  human resources and other administrative personnel  as well as accounting and legal professional services fees and other corporate expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as we expect to continue to invest in corporate infrastructure and incur additional expenses associated with being a public company  including increased legal and accounting costs  investor relations costs  independent director compensation  exchange listing fees and stockholder related fees  higher insurance premiums and compliance costs in connection with section of the sarbanes oxley act of in  we expect there will be increases to certain general and administrative expenses to support our expansion into new international markets 
however  we also are taking steps to reduce certain general and administrative expenses as we realign our resources with our business priorities 
stock compensation charge 
included in the respective operating expense lines for is an aggregate million expense  consisting of million in stock based compensation expense and million in payroll tax expense  related to common stock grants awarded to key employees equal to a total of  shares in april this grant was net of the number of shares required to be withheld to satisfy the federal  state and local tax withholding obligations 
the aggregate grant date fair value of the awards was million  which we recognized as stock based compensation expense on the grant date  as the awards were immediately vested 
we allocated this million aggregate expense among the operating expense line items in accordance with the functions performed by the respective employees who received the grants 
no such grant was made in other income expense other income expense primarily consists of interest income and interest expense

income tax expense benefit income tax expense benefit consists of federal  state and foreign income taxes

we expect our income tax expense to increase in absolute dollars as our income continues to grow 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in presenting our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
some of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
we base these estimates and assumptions on historical experience or on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable and appropriate under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we reconsider and evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
our future estimates may change if the underlying assumptions change 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting policies listed below involve our more significant judgments  assumptions and estimates and  therefore  could have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements

revenue recognition for arrangements with multiple deliverables as of january   we began to recognize revenue prospectively for new arrangements with multiple deliverables in accordance with asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multiple 
table of contents deliverable revenue arrangements asu no 

for multi element arrangements that include online services and auxiliary items  such as headsets and audio practice products which provide stand alone value to the customer  we allocate revenue to all deliverables based on their relative selling prices in accordance with asu no 
the new accounting principles establish a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables as follows i vendor specific objective evidence of fair value vsoe  ii third party evidence of selling price tpe  and iii best estimate of the selling price esp 
vsoe generally exists only when we sell the deliverable separately and is the price that we actually charge for that deliverable 
esps reflect our best estimates of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand alone basis 
we have identified two deliverables generally contained in arrangements involving the sale of online services bundled with auxiliary items 
the first deliverable is the auxiliary items  which are delivered at the time of sale  and the second deliverable is the online services 
we allocate revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method 
amounts allocated to the auxiliary items are recognized at the time of sale  provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
amounts allocated to the online services are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the online services 
the auxiliary item cost of sales are generally recognized at the time of sale

we allocate revenue between these two deliverables using the relative selling price method 
amounts allocated to the software are recognized at the time of sale  provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met

the language learning software cost of sales are generally recognized at the time of sale 
costs for online services and sales and marketing are expensed as incurred 
we account for multiple element arrangements that consist only of software or software related products  in accordance with industry specific accounting guidance for software and software related transactions 
for such transactions  revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of each element  and fair value is generally determined by vsoe 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in such multiple element arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance accounting standards codification topic  compensation stock compensation asc  which we adopted effective january  under asc  all stock based awards  including employee stock option grants  are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized as expense in the statement of operations on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
as of december  and  there were approximately million and million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to non vested stock option awards that is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of and years  respectively 

table of contents the following table presents the stock based compensation expense for stock options and restricted stock included in the related financial statement line items in thousands years ended december  included in cost of revenue cost of product revenue cost of subscription and service revenue total included in cost of revenue included in operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative total included in operating expenses total in accordance with asc topic  the fair value of stock based awards to employees is calculated as of the date of grant 
compensation expense is then recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
we use the black scholes pricing model to value our stock options  which requires the use of estimates  including future stock price volatility  expected term and forfeitures 
stock based compensation expense recognized is based on the estimated portion of the awards that are expected to vest 
estimated forfeiture rates were applied in the expense calculation 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model as follows year ended december  expected stock price volatility expected term of options years years years expected dividend yield risk free interest rate prior to the completion of our initial public offering in april  our stock was not publicly quoted and we had a limited history of stock option activity  so we reviewed a group of comparable industry related companies to estimate our expected volatility over the most recent period commensurate with the estimated expected term of the awards 
in addition to analyzing data from the peer group  we also considered the contractual option term and vesting period when determining the expected option life and forfeiture rate 
subsequent to the initial public offering  we continue to review a group of comparable industry related companies to estimate volatility  but also review the volatility of our own stock since the initial public offering 
we consider the volatility of the comparable companies to be the best estimate of future volatility 
for the risk free interest rate  we use a us treasury bond rate consistent with the estimated expected term of the option award 

table of contents the following table sets forth a summary of stock option grants since the date of plan inception  through the date of this annual report on form k grant date number of options granted exercise price common stock fair value per share at grant date stock based compensation expense in connection with executive stock grants and ipo option and restricted stock grants we made stock grants  restricted stock grants and stock option grants to our employees on april  in connection with these grants  we recorded an aggregate expense of approximately million in the second quarter of  and an additional million that will be recorded over the four year vesting period of the stock options and restricted stock grants 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable based on past collection history and specific risks identified 
intangible assets intangible assets consist of acquired technology  including developed and core technology  customer related assets  trade name and trademark and other intangible assets 
those intangible assets with finite lives are recorded at cost and amortized on a straight line basis over their expected lives in accordance with accounting standards codification topic  goodwill and other intangible assets asc 
on an annual basis  we review our indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment based on the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets as compared to the carrying value in accordance with asc in the event the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets  the assets are written down to their fair value 
there has been no impairment of intangible assets during any of the periods presented 
goodwill in accordance with asc  goodwill is not amortized and is tested for impairment annually on june th and whenever events and circumstances occur indicating goodwill might be impaired 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment by comparing the fair value of our one reporting unit with its carrying amount 
the second step measures the amount of impairment loss  if any 
as of june  and  we reviewed the goodwill for impairment and determined that no impairment of goodwill was identified during any of the periods presented  nor is the reporting unit at risk of failing step one of the goodwill impairment test 
valuation of long lived assets in accordance with accounting standards codification topic  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets asc  we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets 
asc requires recognition of impairment of long lived assets in the event that the net book value of such 
table of contents assets exceeds the future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to such assets 
impairment  if any  is recognized in the period of identification to the extent the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the fair value of such asset 
based on our analysis  we believe that no impairment of our long lived assets was indicated as of december  and income taxes for the years ended december   and  we accounted for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification topic  income taxes asc  which provides for an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax consequences of the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities versus the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
under this method  deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the impact of tax rate changes on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the year that the change is enacted 
in  we recognized a tax benefit of million due to the release of the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets which we believe are more likely than not to be realized 
our effective income tax rate has benefited from the availability of previously unrealized deferred tax assets which we have utilized to reduce tax expense for united kingdom and japanese income tax purposes 
the release of our valuation allowance was determined in accordance with the provisions of asc  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence when determining whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets are recoverable  such assessment is required on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
historical operating income and continuing projected income represent sufficient positive evidence that we have used to conclude that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized and accordingly  a release of our valuation allowance was recorded in the fourth quarter of in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued certain provisions in the accounting standards codification topic  income taxes overall recognition  asc  which clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise financial statements in accordance with asc and prescribe a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
these provisions also provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
we adopted these recognition provisions of asc effective january  the adoption of asc did not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows

the decrease in consumer revenue was primarily driven by continued weakness in the us kiosk and us direct to consumer sales verticals  offset by growth in our international consumer verticals 
additionally  we deferred million in revenue in the us consumer market related to our version totale online services as described below 
product revenue represented of total consumer revenue for the year ended december   with the balance attributable to subscription and service revenue 
we began bundling time based subscription licenses of our web based totale services with perpetual licenses of our rosetta stone version language learning solutions in the us consumer market during the third quarter of with the launch of rosetta stone version totale 
as a result  we defer approximately of each of these bundled sales 
we will recognize the deferred revenue over the term of the subscription license in accordance with accounting standards codification subtopic  software revenue recognition 
direct to consumer direct to consumer revenue was million for the year ended december  an increase of  million or  from the year ended december  the increase in direct to consumer revenue was primarily driven by growth in our international direct to consumer markets  offset by continued decline in our us direct to consumer business 
the decline in our us direct to consumer business was driven by lower web and call center traffic 
additionally  the price of media increased causing a decline in returns on invested media 
the downward trends in the us could continue into we are considering significant changes in our marketing  pricing  product and packaging to change the negative trends in the us market 
it is not clear whether these changes will improve the downward revenue and profit trends 

table of contents kiosk kiosk revenue was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or  from the year ended december  despite the increase in the number of worldwide kiosks from to during the year ended december   annual net revenue per kiosk declined due to lower foot traffic 
we plan to continually review kiosk performance in and we may close our underperforming kiosk locations 
retail retail revenue was million for the year ended december   an increase of million or from the year ended december  the increase in retail revenue was primarily driven by holiday season stock in orders received from our larger retail partners during the fourth quarter of  as well as the expansion of our retail footprint with the addition of new retail relationships in during the fourth quarter of  we reduced revenue by million as a result of changing our revenue recognition to cash basis for borders  as a result of its chapter bankruptcy reorganization 
we work with retail partners to monitor quantity on hand and sell through of our product within the retail channel 
as a result of lower than anticipated sell through in our retail channel during the fourth quarter of  we believe inventory levels at our two largest retail partners are higher than historical levels 
as such  we expect shipments of our products and related revenue to those retailers to be down substantially during the first quarter of we are in the process of testing changes to the pricing of our products 
if we reduce our prices as a result of successful tests in an effort to increase sales volume and overall market penetration we may provide our retailers and distributors with price protection on existing inventories  which would allow these retailers and distributors a credit against amounts owed with respect to unsold packaged product under certain conditions 
these price protection reserves could be material in future periods 
home school for the year ended december   we reclassified our home school sales vertical from institutional to consumer

 consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities 
asu no 
changes how a reporting entity determines when an entity that is insufficiently capitalized or is not controlled through voting or similar rights should be consolidated 
the determination of whether a reporting entity is required to consolidate another entity is based on  among other things  the other entity purpose and design and the reporting entity ability to direct the activities of the other entity that most significantly impact the other entity economic performance 
asu no 
requires a reporting entity to provide additional disclosures about its involvement with variable interest entities and any significant changes in risk exposure due to that involvement 
a reporting entity is required to disclose how its involvement with a variable interest entity affects the reporting entity financial statements 
asu no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years

 revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
asu no 
addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit

the company elected prospective adoption during the quarter ended march  under the historical accounting principles  the company was required to account for online services bundled with auxiliary items  such as headsets and audio companions  using the residual method or by treating the arrangements as one unit of accounting 
asu no 
requires the company to account for the sale of online services 
table of contents bundled with auxiliary items as two deliverables 
the first deliverable is the auxiliary items which are delivered at the time of sale  and the second deliverable is the online services

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk the functional currency of our foreign subsidiaries is their local currency 
accordingly  our results of operations and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the volatility of the prices and applicable rates are dependent on many factors that we cannot forecast with reliable accuracy 
in the event our foreign sales and expenses increase  our operating results may be more greatly affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of the currencies with which we do business 
at this time we do not  but we may in the future  invest in derivatives or other financial instruments in an attempt to hedge our foreign currency exchange risk 
interest rate sensitivity interest income and expense are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
however  based on the nature and current level of our marketable securities  which are primarily short term investment grade and government securities and our notes payable  we believe that there is no material risk of exposure
