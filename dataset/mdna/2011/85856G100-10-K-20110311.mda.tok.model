dividends it is the policy of the federal reserve board that bank holding companies should pay cash dividends on common stock only from income available as defined  and only from prospective earnings retention consistent with the organization s expected future needs and financial condition 
the policy provides that the bank holding companies should not maintain a level of cash dividends that undermines the ability to serve as a source of strength to the banking subsidiary 
the company is a bank holding company separate and apart from its subsidiary  and thus has liquidity needs that are funded primarily by the income of its subsidiary 
the holding company s cash outflows consist of dividends to shareholders  interest on borrowings and unallocated corporate expenses 
the main sources of funding for the holding company are the management fees and dividends it receives from its banking subsidiary

the company is in compliance with the requirements of the patriot act 
deposit insurance premiums on november   the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic issued a final rule implementing section of the dodd frank act that provides for unlimited insurance coverage of certain non interest bearing accounts 
beginning december   through december   all non interest bearing transaction accounts are fully insured  regardless of the balance of the account  at all fdic insured institutions 
the unlimited insurance coverage is available to all depositors  including consumers  businesses  and government entities 
this unlimited insurance coverage is separate from  and in addition to  the insurance coverage provided to a depositor s other deposit accounts held at an fdic insured institution 
the fdic has set a designated reserve ratio of for each of insured deposits for the deposit insurance fund dif 
the federal deposit insurance act of fdic act provides the fdic board of directors the authority to set the designated reserve ratio between and 
the fdic must adopt a restoration plan when the reserve ratio falls below and begin paying dividends when the reserve ratio exceeds 
there is no requirement to achieve a specific ratio within a given timeframe 
the dif reserve ratio calculated by the fdic at september  was a negative 
and therefore  the fdic needs to increase premiums charged to banks 
in  the annual insurance premiums on bank deposits insured by the dif varied between 
per of deposits for banks classified in the highest capital and supervisory evaluation categories to 
per of deposits for banks classified in the lowest capital and supervisory evaluation categories 
the amount of fdic assessments paid by each dif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors 
since  there have been higher levels of bank failures  which has dramatically increased resolution costs of the fdic and depleted the dif 
in order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the dif  the fdic has increased assessment rates of insured institutions and may continue to do so in the future 
as of december   the company s subsidiary bank s assessment rate averaged 
cents per in assessable deposits 
on november   the fdic adopted a final rule requiring depository institutions to prepay their estimated quarterly insurance premium for fourth quarter and all of  and on december   the company pre paid estimated assessments of million for the years and million remained as a prepaid balance at december  the expense related to this prepayment is anticipated to be recognized over the next two years based on actual calculations of quarterly premiums 
the fdic has redefined its deposit insurance premium assessment base to be an institution s average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity as required by the dodd frank act and revised deposit insurance assessment rate schedules in light of the changes to the assessment base 
the proposed rate schedule and other revisions to the assessment rules  which were adopted by the fdic board of directors on february   will become effective april  and will be used to calculate the june  assessment

table of contents item a 
risk factors in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to various risks 
management balances the company s strategic goals  including revenue and profitability objectives  with the associated risks 
this section highlights specific risks that could affect the company and its business 
although current key factors are discussed  please be aware that other risks may prove to be important in the future 
new risks may emerge at any time and the company cannot predict such risks or estimate the extent to which they may affect financial performance 
this listing should not be considered all inclusive 
if any of the following risks were to occur  the company may not be able to conduct business as currently planned and financial condition or operating results could be negatively impacted 
these matters could cause the trading price of the company s common stock to decline in future periods 
recent negative developments in the financial services sector and us and global credit markets may negatively impact operations and results 
the us economy was in recession from december through june business activity across a broad range of industries and regions in the u 
s 
was greatly reduced 
although economic conditions have begun to improve  certain sectors  such as real estate  remain weak and unemployment remains high 
local governments and many businesses are still in serious difficulty due to lower consumer spending and the lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
market conditions also played a role in the failure or merger of several prominent financial institutions and numerous regional and community based financial institutions 
these failures  as well as projected future failures  have had a significant negative impact on the capitalization level of the deposit insurance fund of the fdic  which in turn  has led to a significant increase in deposit insurance premiums paid by financial institutions 
the company s financial performance generally  and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans  as well as demand for loans and other products and services the company offers  is highly dependent upon on the business environment in the markets where the company operates  in the commonwealth of virginia and in the united states as a whole 
a favorable business environment is generally characterized by  among other factors  economic growth  efficient capital markets  low inflation  low unemployment  high business and investor confidence  and strong business earnings 
unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth  business activity or investor or business confidence  limitatio ns on the availability or increases in the cost of credit and capital  increases in inflation or interest rates  high unemployment  natural disasters  or a combination of these or other factors 
overall  during  the business environment has been adverse for many households and businesses in the united states and worldwide 
while economic conditions in the commonwealth of virginia  the united states and worldwide have begun to improve  there can be no assurance that this improvement will continue 
such conditions could adversely affect the credit quality of the company s loans  results of operations and financial condition 
the company is subject to credit risk 
there are inherent risks associated with the company s lending activities 
these risks include  among other things  the impact of changes in interest rates and changes in the economic conditions in the markets where the company operates as well as those across the commonwealth of virginia and the united states 
increases in interest rates and or weakening economic conditions could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans or the value of the collateral securing these loans 
the company is also subject to various laws and regulations that affect its lending activities 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject the company to regulatory enforcement action that could result in the assessment of significant civil monetary penalties against the company 
as of december   approximately of the company s loan portfolio consisted of commercial and industrial  construction and commercial real estate mortgage loans 
these types of loans are generally viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or consumer loans 
these types of loans are also typically larger than residential real estate loans and consumer loans 
because the company s loan portfolio contains commercial and industrial  construction and commercial real estate loans with relatively large individual balances  the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in non performing loans 
an increase in non performing loans could result in a net loss of earnings from these loans  an increase in the provision for possible loan losses and an incre ase in loan charge offs  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the company is subject to interest rate risk 
the company s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond the company s control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the federal open market committee 
changes in monetary policy  including changes in interest rates  could influence not only the interest the company receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect i the company s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  ii the fair value of the company s financial assets and liabilities  and iii the average duration of the company s mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  the company s net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
although management believes it has implemented effective asset and liability management strategies  including the use of derivatives as hedging instruments  to reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on the company s results of operations  any substantial  unexpected  prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
if the allowance for loan losses becomes inadequate  results of operations may be adversely affected 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses that it believes is adequate to absorb estimated incurred losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
through a periodic review and consideration of the loan portfolio  management determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses by considering current general market conditions  credit quality of the loan portfolio and performance of customers relative to their financial obligations 
the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates that may be beyond the company s control and these losses may cause the loan loss provision to vary widely from recent levels 
although management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio  it is an estimate subject to revision as losses are confirmed 
higher levels of loan losses in the future could have a material adverse impact on financial performance 
federal and state regulators  as an integral part of their supervisory function  periodically review the allowance for loan losses 
these regulatory agencies may require the company to increase the provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge offs based upon their judgments  which may be different from management s 
any increase in the allowance for loan losses required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s profitability depends significantly on local economic conditions 
the company s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the markets in which it operates 
unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified  the company provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in northern  central and western virginia 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the company s business  real estate and construction loans  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  an outbreak of hostilities or other interna tional or domestic calamities  unemployment or other factors beyond the company s control  could impact these local economic conditions and could result in  among other things  a deterioration in credit quality or a reduced demand for credit  including a resultant effect on the loan portfolio and allowance the loan and lease losses 
the company is subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 
the company is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not security holders 
these regulations affect the company s lending practices  capital structure  investment practices  dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
the dodd frank act  enacted in july  instituted major changes to the banking and financial institutions regulatory regimes in light of the recent performance of and government intervention in the financial services sector 
other changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect the company in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject the company to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products the company may offer and or increase the ability of non banks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the recent repeal of federal prohibitions on payment of interest on demand deposits could increase the company s interest expense 
all federal prohibitions on the ability of financial institutions to pay interest on demand deposit accounts were repealed as part of the dodd frank act 
as a result  beginning on july   financial institutions could commence offering interest on demand deposits to compete for clients 
the company does not yet know what interest rates other institutions may offer 
the company s interest expense will increase and its net interest margin will decrease if it begins offering interest on demand deposits to attract additional customers or maintain current customers  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
continued growth may require the need for additional capital and further regulatory approvals which  if not obtained  could adversely impact profitability and implementation of current strategic initiatives 
to ensure continued growth  the company will need to provide sufficient capital through earnings generation  additional equity or trust preferred offerings or borrowed funds or any combination of these funding sources 
for certain amounts or types of indebtedness  the company may be required to obtain certain regulatory approvals beforehand 
the ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on the company s financial performance  as well as conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside the company s control 
accordingly  the company cannot assure its ability to raise additional capital if needed on acceptable terms 
if the company cannot raise additional capital when needed  its ability to further expand and grow operations and attain long term profitability goals could be materially impact ed 
the company s subsidiary bank s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations which  to the extent the company requires such dividends in the future  may affect its ability to pay obligations and dividends 
the company is a separate legal entity from the subsidiary bank  and thus does not have significant revenue sources of its own 
it currently depends on the subsidiary bank s cash and liquidity as well as dividends from the banking subsidiary to pay operating expenses and dividends to shareholders 
no assurance can be made that in the future the subsidiary bank will have the capacity to pay the necessary dividends or that the company will not require dividends from the subsidiary bank to satisfy the company s obligations 
the availability of dividends from the subsidiary bank is limited by various statutes and regulations 
depending upon the financial condition of the company and other factors  it is possible that the federal reserve board could limit the payment of dividends or other payments by the subsidiary bank 
in the event the subsidiary bank is unable to pay dividends sufficient to satisfy the company obligations  it may not be able to service its obligations as they become due  or pay dividends on the company common stock 
consequently  the inability to receive dividends from the subsidiary bank could adversely affect financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company s profitability may suffer because of rapid and unpredictable changes in the highly regulated environment in which it operates 
the company is subject to extensive supervision by several governmental regulatory agencies at the federal and state levels 
recently enacted  proposed and future banking legislation and regulations have had  will continue to have  or may have a significant impact on the financial services industry 
these regulations  which are intended to protect depositors and not shareholders  and the interpretation and application of them by federal and state regulators  are beyond the company s control  may change rapidly and unpredictably and can be expected to influence earnings and growth 
the company s success depends on its continued ability to maintain compliance with these regulations 
some of these regulations may increase costs and thus place other financial institutions that are not subject to similar regulations in stronger  more favorable competitive positions 
concentration in loans secured by real estate may increase loan losses  which would negatively affect financial results 
the company offers a variety of secured loans  including commercial lines of credit  commercial term loans  real estate  construction  home equity  consumer and other loans 
many loans are secured by real estate both residential and commercial in the company s market area 
at december   approximately and of the billion loans receivable portfolio were secured by commercial and residential real estate  respectively 
continued pressures on the real estate markets  such as deterioration in the value of this collateral and the current recession in national and local economies  could adversely affect customers ability to pay these loans  which in turn could impact the company 
risk of loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry  and the company tries to limit exposure to this ris k by monitoring extensions of credit carefully 
the company cannot fully eliminate credit risk  and as a result credit losses may occur in the future 

table of contents the value of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future 
as of december   the company had million of goodwill and million of other intangible assets 
a significant decline in the company s expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in the business climate  slower growth rates or a significant and sustained decline in the price of the company s common stock may necessitate taking charges in the future related to the impairment of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets 
if the company were to conclude that a future write down of goodwill and other intangible assets is necessary  the company would record the appropriate charge  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company depends on the services of key personnel  and a loss of any of those personnel may disrupt operations and result in reduced revenues 
the company s success depends upon the continued service of the senior management team and upon the company s ability to attract and retain qualified financial services personnel 
competition for qualified employees is intense 
in the company s experience  it can take a significant period of time to identify and hire personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required in carrying out strategy 
if the company loses the services of key personnel  or is unable to attract additional qualified personnel  the business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
the company is subject to executive compensation restrictions because of its participation in the treasury s capital purchase program 
the company is subject to tarp rules and standards governing executive compensation  which generally apply to the chief executive officer  chief financial officer and the three next most highly compensated senior executive officers and  with recent amendments  to a number of other employees 
the standards include i a requirement to recover any bonus payment to senior executive officers or certain other employees if payment was based on materially inaccurate financial statements or performance metric criteria  ii a prohibition on making any golden parachute payments to senior executive officers and certain other employees  iii a prohibition on paying or accruing any bonus payment to certain employees  except as otherwise permitted by the rules  iv a prohibition on maintaining any plan for senior executiv e officers that encourages such officers to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the company s value  v a prohibition on maintaining any employee compensation plan that encourages the manipulation of reported earnings to enhance the compensation of any employee  and vi a prohibition on providing tax gross ups to senior executive officers and certain other employees 
these restrictions and standards could limit the company s ability to recruit and retain executives 
the securities purchase agreement between the company and treasury permits treasury to impose additional restrictions retroactively 
the securities purchase agreement the company entered into with treasury permits treasury to unilaterally amend the terms of the securities purchase agreement to comply with any changes in federal statutes after the date of its execution 
arra imposed additional executive compensation and expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients  including the company  until it has repaid treasury 
these additional restrictions may impede the company s ability to attract and retain qualified executive officers 
arra also permits tarp recipients to repay the treasury without penalty or requirement that additional capital be raised  subject to treasury s consultation with the company s primary federal regulator while the securities purchase agreement required that  for a period of three years  the s eries b preferred stock could generally only be repaid if the company raised additional capital to repay the securities and such capital qualified as tier capital 
additional unilateral changes in the securities purchase agreement could have a negative impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
while the company s common stock is currently traded on the nasdaq stock market s global select market  it has less liquidity than stocks for larger companies quoted on a national securities exchange 
the trading volume in the company s common stock on the nasdaq global select market has been relatively low when compared with larger companies listed on the nasdaq global select market or other stock exchanges 
although the company has experienced increased liquidity in the stock  it cannot say with any certainty that a more active and liquid trading market for its common stock will continue to develop 
because of this  it may be more difficult for shareholders to sell a substantial number of shares for the same price at which shareholders could sell a smaller number of shares 
the company cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of its common stock in the market  or the availability of shares of common stock for sale in the market  will have on the market price of its common stock 
the company can give no assurance that sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the market  or the potential for large amounts of sales in the market  would not cause the price of its common stock to decline or impair its future ability to raise capital through sales of its common stock 
the market price of the company s common stock has fluctuated significantly  and may fluctuate in the future 
these fluctuations may be unrelated to its performance 
general market or industry price declines or overall market volatility in the future could adversely affect the price of the company s common stock  and the current market price may not be indicative of future market prices 

table of contents the company s business is technology dependent  and an inability to invest in technological improvements may adversely affect results of operations and financial condition 
the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to better customer service  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and results in reduced costs 
the company s future success will depend in part upon its ability to create synergies in its operations through the use of technology  particularly in light of its past and projected growth strategy 
many competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
the company cannot make assurances that technological improvements will increase operational efficiency or that it will be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers 
the company may be adversely affected by the soundness of other financial institutions 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty  or other relationships 
the company has exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and routinely executes transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including commercial banks  brokers and dealers  investment banks  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose the company to credit risk in the event of a default by a counterparty or client 
in addition  the company s credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by the company cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the credit or derivative exposure due to the company 
any such losses could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company s operations rely on certain external vendors 
the company is reliant upon certain external vendors to provide products and services necessary to maintain day to day operations of the company 
accordingly  the company s operations are exposed to risk that these vendors will not perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements 
the company maintains a system of comprehensive policies and a control framework designed to monitor vendor risks including  among other things  i changes in the vendor s organizational structure  ii changes in the vendor s financial condition  iii changes in the vendor s support for existing products and services and iv changes in the vendor s strategic focus 
while the company believes these policies and procedures help to mitigate risk  the failure of an external vendor to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements could be disruptive to the company s operations  which could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and  in turn  the company s financial condition and results of operations

the following discussion and analysis should be read along with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein 
executive overview the slowly improving economic environment during positively impacted the company s financial performance as it realized net income of million and net income available to common shareholders of million  or per common share  compared to a net loss of million  or per common share in key factors affecting full year results included expansion of net interest margin  decrease in non performing assets as a percentage of total assets and elevated mortgage banking revenues  offset by the accelerated resolution of problem credits through charge offs  increased write downs of foreclosed assets and losses from mortgage indemnifications 
the company recorded a provision for loan losses of million for  a decrease of million compared to the million recorded in the provision compares to net charge offs of million for the year 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans decreased from at december  to at december   reflecting the company s continuing focus on resolving problem credits in its loan portfolio 
while it is difficult to predict the impact or length of the recessionary economy  the company anticipates continued improvement to the elevated levels of non performing assets and net charge offs in despite the challenging economic environment  the company continues to operate in a position of strength and is focused on expanding revenue  building efficiencies  increasing the profitability of the balance sheet  investing for the future  and prudently managing credit 
to this end  it remains acutely focused on clients  improving service quality and front line execution  controlling expenses  and managing risk 
during the year  loan demand was down  credit costs were higher  and asset quality was challenging 
continued economic weakness has reduced demand for loans as customers attempt to reduce debt and preserve capital 
however  the company has also experienced strong deposit growth  positive fee income growth  continued strong expense management  and credit trends and margin that improved during the last quarter of specific ally  in the last quarter of  the company experienced reduced net charge offs and provisioning  and a stabilization of nonperforming assets 
management believes the strong capital position coupled with client focused execution  will enable the company to implement a leveraging strategy by seeking acquisition and merger partners in higher growth markets when the economic climate improves 
the company began reporting segment information during the year ended december  and began tracking the related information for internal purposes during the year ended december  therefore  there is no comparative data presented for the year ended december   as this data was not tracked by segment during this time period and is therefore unavailable 
the company s commercial bank segment recorded retail banking fee income of million for  a decrease of thousand or compared to million for this sequential year decrease was attributable to a decrease of million in consumer overdraft fees  which resulted from implementing the modifications to regulation e that became effective during and was partially offset by an increase in interchange fee income of thousand 
tax equivalent interest income for this segment increased million or to million in this was driven by a basis point increase in interest rate spread to in the segment recorded a provision for loan losses of million for  a decrease of million compared to the million recorded in  due to the factors outlined above  income from this business segment totaled million for the year ended december  and a loss of million for the year ended december  revenues from the company s mortgage banking segment totaled million for the year ended december   or up million or compared to million for the year ended december  the mortgage revenue increase for was offset by million in indemnification losses recognized  which compares to million for during the current year million of this expense was associated with a settlement that extinguished all outstanding and potential mortgage repurchase and make whole claims arising out of alleged breaches of representations and warranties related to loans sold by stellarone corporation or its legacy companies to a primary investor prior to january  this settlement resolved approximately of current claims outstanding with all investors and i s anticipated to mitigate future off balance sheet risk associated with repurchase and indemnifications 
due to the factors outlined above  net income from this business segment totaled thousand and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents the company s wealth management segment realized income of thousand during  an increase of thousand or compared to thousand during revenues from trust and brokerage fees for the were million or up thousand or when compared to million realized during higher fee realizations and increased assets under management attributed to the revenue increase 
fiduciary and brokerage assets increased to million at december  compared to million at december  results of operations net interest income the primary source of the company s traditional banking revenue is net interest income  which represents the difference between interest income on earning assets and interest expense on liabilities used to fund those assets 
earning assets include loans  securities  and federal funds sold 
interest bearing liabilities include deposits and borrowings 
to compare the tax exempt yields to taxable yields  amounts are adjusted to pretax equivalents based on a federal corporate income tax rate 
net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates  volume of interest bearing assets and liabilities  and the composition of those assets and liabilities 
the interest rate spread and net interest margin are two common statistics related to changes in net interest income 
the interest rate spread represents the difference between the yields earned on interest earning assets and the rates paid for interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin is defined as the percentage of net interest income to average earning assets 
earning assets obtained through noninterest bearing sources of funds such as regular demand deposits and stockholders equity result in a net interest margin that is higher than the interest rate spread 
compared to tax equivalent net interest income in was million  an increase of million or compared to million in average interest earning assets decreased million or to billion  while average loans decreased million or to billion 
the average interest rate spread was in  an increase of basis points from in the net interest margin was in  an increase of basis points from in the re pricing sensitivity of interest bearing liabilities outpaced interest earning assets during as approximately million or approximately of the cd portfolio re priced resulting in a decrease of basis points and basis points for time deposits less than thousand and greater than thousand  respectively 
additionally  the cost of funds associated with fhlb advances decreased basis points as a few higher priced advances matured near the end of the year 
the yield on average loans decreased basis points in  while the yield on investment securities decreased basis points for the period 
interest expense as a percentage of average earning assets decreased to  down basis points from in  reflecting a basis point decrease in average cost of retail deposits to  and a basis point decrease in average total funding cost to 
compared to tax equivalent net interest income in was million  a decrease of million or compared to million in average interest earning assets increased million or to billion  while average loans increased million or to billion 
these increases are primarily attributable to having a full year effect on the average balances from the merger of equals transaction consummated in early  while the amounts only included a ten month effect 
additionally  the increased liquidity provided by deposit growth during the year that was unable to be reinvested in the form of loans resulted in higher interest bearing deposits and fed funds sold balances 
margin for was positively impacted by the loan discount  cd premium and a borrowing premium associated with the vfg fnb merger  all of which began amortizing during these premiums and discounts stem from adjusting assets and liabilities to their respective market values as part of the purchase adjustments associated with the merger 
the effect of the purchase accounting items is an increase in net interest margin of approximately thirty basis points for with only a ten basis point effect on margin or a twenty basis point decrease related to purchase accounting adjustments year over year 
the average interest rate spread was in  down fifty nine basis points from in the net interest margin was in  down sixty four basis points from in the decrease in the company s net interest margin was attributable to a relatively high level of fixed rate re pricing in the loan portfolio  the impact of an increased amount of loans in nonaccrual status and a higher level of short term liquidity in the balance sheet 
the yield on average loans decreased one hundred five basis points in  while the yield on investment securities decreased forty four basis points for the period 
interest expense as a percentage of average earning assets decreased to  down forty four basis points from in  reflecting a forty eight basis point decrease in average cost of retail deposits to  and a forty nine basis point decrease in average total funding cost to 

table of contents interest sensitivity financial institutions can be exposed to several market risks that may impact the value or future earnings capacity of an organization 
these risks involve interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk and equity market price risk 
the company does not currently have any exposure to foreign currency exchange risk  commodity price risk or equity market price risk 
the company s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is inherent because as a financial institution  the company derives a significant amount of its operating revenue from purchasing funds customer deposits and borrowings at various terms and rates 
these funds are then invested into earning assets loans  leases  investments  etc 
at various terms an d rates 
this risk is further discussed below 
interest rate risk is the exposure to fluctuations in the company s future earnings earnings at risk and value economic value at risk resulting from changes in interest rates 
this exposure results from differences between the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities that reprice within a specified time period as a result of scheduled maturities and repayment and contractual interest rate changes 
the primary objective of the company s asset liability management process is to maximize current and future net interest income within acceptable levels of interest rate risk while satisfying liquidity and capital requirements 
management recognizes that a certain amount of interest rate risk is inherent and appropriate  yet if not properly managed can be detrimental to the company s long term profitability 
thus the goal of interest rate risk management is to maintain a balance between risk and reward such that net interest income is maximized while risk is maintained at an appropriate level 
the company assumes interest rate risk the risk that general interest rate levels will change as a result of its normal operations 
as a result  the fair values of the company financial instruments will change when interest rate levels change and that change may be either favorable or unfavorable to the company 
management attempts to match maturities of assets and liabilities to the extent believed necessary to minimize interest rate risk 
however  borrowers with fixed rate obligations are less likely to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment 
conversely  depositors who are receiving fixed rates are more likely to withdraw funds before maturity in a rising rate environment and less likely to do so in a falling rate environment 
 management monitors rates and maturities of assets and liabilities and attempts to minimize interest rate risk by adjusting terms of new loans and deposits and by investing in securities with terms that mitigate the company overall interest rate risk 
management endeavors to control the exposures to changes in interest rates by understanding  reviewing and making decisions based on its risk position 
the corporate asset liability committee is responsible for these decisions 
the committee operates under management policies defining guidelines and limits on the level of acceptable risk 
these policies are approved by the boards of directors of the company and its banking subsidiary 
the company primarily uses the securities portfolios and fhlb advances to manage its interest rate risk position 
additionally  pricing  promotion and product development activities are directed in an effort to emphasize the loan and deposit term or repricing characteristics that best meet current interest rate risk objectives 
the company uses simulation analysis to assess earnings at risk and economic value of equity analysis to assess value at risk 
these methods allow management to regularly monitor both the direction and magnitude of the company s interest rate risk exposure 
these modeling techniques involve assumptions and estimates that inherently cannot be measured with complete precision 
key assumptions in the analyses include maturity and repricing characteristics of both assets and liabilities  prepayments on amortizing assets  other imbedded options  non maturity deposit sensitivity and loan and deposit pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
 however  the analyses are useful in quantifying risk and provide a relative gauge of the company s interest rate risk position over time 

table of contents earnings at risk simulation analysis evaluates the effect of upward and downward changes in market interest rates on future net interest income 
the analysis involves changing the interest rates used in determining net interest income over the next twelve months 
the resulting percentage change in net interest income in various rate scenarios is an indication of the company s shorter term interest rate risk 
the analysis utilizes a static balance sheet approach 
the measurement date balance sheet composition or mix is maintained over the simulation time period with maturing and repayment dollars being rolled back into like instruments for new terms at current market rates 
additional assumptions are applied to modify volumes and pricing under the various rate scenarios 
 these include prepayment assumptions on mortgage assets  the sensitivity of non maturity deposit rates  and other factors deemed significant 
the base net interest income simulation performed as of december   assumes interest rates are unchanged for the next months 
the simulation then assumes that rates are shocked up and down by basis points in basis point increments 
the simulation analysis results are presented in the table below 
these results indicate that the company would expect net interest income to increase over the next twelve months by assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points and to increase by if rates shifted downward by basis points 
while the company was asset sensitive at december   simulation results indicate that net interest income would increase slightly in a down rate environment 
this is attributable to the absolute low level of rates in the current economic cycle and floors being reached on assets as d eposits continue to reprice down 
management also evaluates the impact on net interest income assuming a most likely rate scenario utilizing a rate forecast published by global insight 
under this scenario net interest income is anticipated to increase over the next twelve months by 
these profiles reflect a moderate interest rate risk position and are well within the guidelines set by policy 
change in net interest income percentage amount change in yield curve in thousands basis points basis points basis points basis points base case basis points most likely rate scenario economic value of equity the economic value of equity eve analysis provides information on the risk inherent in the balance sheet that might not be taken into account in the simulation analysis due to the shorter time horizon used in that analysis 
the eve of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of expected asset cash flows minus the discounted present value of expected liability cash flows 
the economic value simulation uses instantaneous rate shocks to determine the expected cash flows in various rate scenarios 
the resulting percentage change in eve is an indication of the longer term repricing risk and options embedded in the balance sheet 
the eve analysis results are presented in the table below 
these results as of december  indicate that the eve would increase assuming an immediate upward shift in market interest rates of basis points and decrease if rates shifted downward by basis points 
the company s risk position is outside the guidelines set by policy in the down basis points scenario  but is considered manageable 
this is attributable to the absolute low level of rates in the current economic cycle and floors being reached on assets as deposits continue to reprice down  which negatively impacts economic value

the position in these bank equities was liquidated prior to the end of gains on the sale of securities held for sale were elevated during as the par value of many mortgage backed securities amortized to levels at which the associated administrative costs become less favorable on a per security basis 
when these levels are reached the related securities are sold in a clean up transaction in order to reinvest in securities with higher par values in order to better manage the related administrative costs 
losses on the sale of foreclosed assets remained historically high in due to the continuation of elevated levels of nonperforming assets encountered during and this was primarily due to poor real estate and general market conditions encountered during both years

at december   the company had approximately million in exposure in residential development and construction at smith mountain lake  which compares to million and million at december  and  respectively 
this market caters to individuals who have high amounts of discretionary income and are purchasing a house as a retirement or a second home 
this type of market is the first to contract and the last to return during an economic downturn 
the subsidiary bank s smith mountain lake developments have seen minimal sales during the last four years 
levels of classified loans and specific reserves remain elevated historically 
the increased level of classified loans impacted the level of allocations required based upon historical loss experience resulting in increased provisioning and allowance levels during the last three years 
additionally  specific reserves have been elevated over this same time period amounting to million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
net charge offs were elevated compared to prior periods the elevated charge off levels experienced in the current and prior year warrant a heightened level of provisioning and justify management s use of higher historical charge off factors when considering the losses currently inherent in the loan portfolio during the calculation of the allowance for loan losses 
less than full employment levels in the commonwealth of virginia 
unemployment in the company s geographic footprint is approximately which is above the ideal full employment level defined by the commonwealth as an unemployment level of 
this unemployment level negatively impacts the ability of consumers within the company s footprint to curtail their debts and purchase goods and services 
this general reduction in cash flow has a negative impact on all loan categories within the portfolio 
non traditional mortgage products still present indirect risk 
while the company s subsidiary bank does not originate non traditional mortgages within its own portfolio  the company has risk associated with borrowers who have them 
the allowance analysis has considered this and other qualitative factors 

table of contents the loan portfolio mix indicates a shift away from real estate construction and an increase in the real estate mortgage category 
this shift was driven predominately by the reduction in smith mountain lake exposure as many of these problem credits were brought to final resolution through a combination of work outs and charge offs during the remaining exposure from this segment of the loan portfolio is considered to be minimal 
the risk within the portfolio is reflected in the increase in the allowance allocation associated with the commercial  financial and agricultural category which represents of the related balance at december  the increase in allocation to this category  which includes commercial loans secured by real estate  is also consistent with the decline in real estate values across the company s footprint  which leads to a greater severity of loss during collection efforts 
the allocation to the real estate construction loan portfolio represented approximately and of the allowance balance at december  and  respectively 
this decline is consistent with the reduction in real estate construction loan balances outstanding  which is a result of a deliberate initiative by the company to reduce exposure in this area through the resolution of smith mountain lake problem credits discussed previously 
additionally  unemployment across the company s service area has risen during and  which has led to higher levels of charge offs and the related allowance allocation to consumer loans as loan balances as a percentage of the portfolio have actually declined 
non performing assets consist of the company s non accrual loans  troubled debt restructurings  and other property owned 
loans are generally placed on non accrual status when the collection of principal and interest is ninety days or more past due  or earlier  if collection is uncertain based on an evaluation of the net realizable value of the collateral and the financial strength of the borrower 
as of december   the company is not aware of any material performing loans with indications of possible credit problems that should be moved to non accrual status 
for those loans which are carried on non accrual status  interest is generally recognized on a cash basis 
the following table presents information concerning the aggregate amount of non performing assets december  in thousands non accrual loans real estate construction real estate mortgage commercial  financial and agricultural consumer loans troubled debt restructurings mortgage loans held for sale foreclosed assets total non performing assets loans greater than days still accruing non performing assets to total assets non performing assets to year end loans and foreclosed assets if interest on nonaccrual loans and nonperforming troubled debt restructurings had been accrued  such income would have approximated million  thousand  thousand  thousand and thousand for each of the five years ended december   respectively 
no interest income on nonaccrual and non performing troubled debt restructurings was included in net income for any of the five years ended december  impaired loans totaled million at december  this total includes million individually evaluated for impairment and million of impaired loans that were collectively evaluated for impairment 
interest is not typically accrued on impaired loans  however  all loans classified as troubled debt restructurings are considered impaired 
at december   the company had million in loans under troubled debt restructuring terms tdrs and million of these restructurings were accruing interest 
interest income recognized on these tdrs was thousand  thousand and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a cash basis  interest recognized on these tdrs was thousand  thousand and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other than these consumer real estate loans designated as tdrs  no interest income has been recognized on impaired loans subsequent to their classification as impaired for the years ended december   and the company collectively evaluates smaller balance homogenous loans for impairment  unless such loans are subject to a restructuring agreement 
collectively evaluated nonaccrual loans excluded from the impaired loan disclosure amounted to million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
at december   total non performing assets totaled million  a decrease of million from nonperforming assets remain at historically elevated levels and reflect actions taken to address the continuing challenges in the residential housing market and persisting credit quality issues in acquisition and development construction credits  commercial real estate credits and real estate mortgage loans 
the decrease in the level of non performing assets is a result of efforts to accelerate the identification and resolution of problem credits by the company s special assets group 
this is also illustrated by proceeds from the sale of foreclosed assets of million in which compares to proceeds of million in at december   total non performing assets totaled million  an increase of million from the increased levels of nonperforming assets reflect actions taken to address the continuing challenges in the residential housing market and deterioration of credit quality in a limited number of acquisition and development construction credits 
additionally  much of the growth in these levels is also inherently attributable to the nonorganic growth associated with doubling in size from the merger of equals transaction and have been attributable to the deterioration in general market conditions

the average balance outstanding of short term borrowings did not exceed of stockholders equity during the years ended december  or capital adequacy the management of capital in a regulated financial services industry must properly balance return on equity to stockholders while maintaining sufficient capital levels and related risk based capital ratios to satisfy regulatory requirements 
additionally  capital management must also consider acquisition opportunities that may exist  and the resulting accounting treatment 
the company s capital management strategies have been developed to provide attractive rates of returns to stockholders  while maintaining its well capitalized position at the banking subsidiary 
the primary source of additional capital to the company is earnings retention  which represents net income less dividends declared 
during  the company paid million in dividends and retained million  or of its net income 
future dividends will be dependent upon the company s ability to generate earnings in future periods 
stockholders equity increased by million  reflecting million of income  million in accrued and paid dividends and increases to additional paid in capital of million associated with the exercise of stock options and stock based compensation 
the company and its banking subsidiary are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by the federal banking agencies 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and possibly additional discretionary actions by regulators that  if undertaken  could have a direct material effect on the company and the subsidiary bank s financial statements 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action under fdicia  the company and its banking subsidiary must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the capital amounts and reclassifications are also subject to qualitative ju dgments by the regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company and its banking subsidiary to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier capital to average assets 
as of december   and  the company and its subsidiary bank met all minimum capital adequacy requirements to which they are subject and are categorized as well capitalized  based on the most recent notification from the federal reserve bank of richmond 
these capital amounts and ratios are incorporated by reference to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements herein 
there are no conditions or events since the notification that management believes have changed the subsidiary bank s category 

table of contents liquidity liquidity is identified as the ability to generate or acquire sufficient amounts of cash when needed and at a reasonable cost to accommodate withdrawals  payments of debt  and increased loan demand 
these events may occur daily or at other short term intervals in the normal operation of the business 
experience helps management predict time cycles in the amount of cash required 
in assessing liquidity  management gives consideration to relevant factors including stability of deposits  quality of assets  economic conditions in the market served  concentrations of business and industry  competition  and the company s overall financial condition 
the company s bank subsidiary has available a million line of credit with the federal home loan bank of atlanta  uncollateralized  unu sed lines of credit totaling million with nonaffiliated banks and access to the federal reserve discount window to support liquidity as conditions dictate 
the liquidity of the parent company also represents an important aspect of liquidity management 
the parent company s cash outflows consist of overhead associated with corporate expenses  executive management  finance  marketing  loan and deposit operations  information technology  human resources  audit  compliance and credit administration functions 
it also includes outflows associated with dividends to shareholders 
the main sources of funding for the parent company are the management fees and dividends it receives from its banking subsidiary and availability on the equity market as deemed necessary 
during  the banking subsidiary paid million in management fees and transferred million in dividends to the company 
as of january   the aggregate amount of additional unrestricted funds  which co uld be transferred from the bank subsidiary to the company without prior regulatory approval totaled million or of consolidated net assets 
loans and advances are limited to of the banks common stock and capital surplus 
as of december   funds available for loans or advances by the bank to the company  which is limited by the amount of collateral the company has available to pledge  were approximately million 
the parent company generated approximately million in cash flow from operating activities in and paid dividends to stockholders of million 
contractual obligations the impact of the company contractual obligations as of december  on liquidity and cash flow in future periods is as follows payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years certificates of deposit subordinated debt fhlb borrowings operating leases total the subordinated debt securities represent two issues maturing on june  and july   respectively 
both issues are currently callable 
commitment expiration by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit mortgage loans sold with potential recourse in the judgment of management  the company maintains the ability to generate sufficient amounts of cash to cover normal requirements and any additional needs which may arise  within realistic limitations 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   the company has not participated in any material unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities 
the company does have significant commitments to fund loans in the ordinary course of business 
at december  and  the following financial instruments were outstanding whose contract amounts represent credit risk commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit mortgage loans sold with potential recourse commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
the commitments for equity lines of credit may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the amount of collateral obtained  if it is deemed necessary by the company  is based on management s credit evaluation of the customer 
unfunded commitments under commercial lines of credit  revolving credit lines and overdraft protection agreements are commitments for possible future extensions of credit to existing customers 
these lines of credit are usually uncollateralized and do not always contain a specified maturity date and may not be drawn upon to the total extent to which the company is committed 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
the company generally holds collateral supporting those commitments  if deemed necessary 
the company  through its banking subsidiaries  originates loans for sale to secondary market investors subject to contractually specified and limited recourse provisions 
in  the company originated million and sold million to investors  compared to million originated and million sold in most contracts with investors contain certain recourse language which may vary from days up to nine months 
the company may have an obligation to repurchase a loan if the mortgagor has defaulted early in the loan term 
mortgages subject to recourse are collateralized by single family residences  have loan to value ratios of or less  or have private mortgage insurance or are insured or guaranteed by an agency of the united states government 
at december   the company had locked rate commitments to originate mortgage loans amounting to approximately million and loans held for sale of million 
the company has entered into commitments  on a best effort basis to sell loans of approximately million 
risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts 
the company does not expect any counterparty to fail to meet its obligations 

table of contents critical accounting estimates general the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states usgaap as well as general practices within the banking industry 
in connection with the application of those principles  management has made judgments and estimates which  in the case of the determination of the allowance for loan losses  mortgage indemnifications and repurchases  deferred tax assets  foreclosed assets and the assessment of impairment of the intangibles have been critical to the determination of the company s financial position and results of operations 
management considers accounting estimates to be critical to reported financial results if i the accounting estimate requires management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and ii different estimates that management reasonably could have used for the accounting estimate in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
allowance for loan losses the company considers the allowance for loan and lease losses of million appropriate to cover losses incurred in the loan and lease portfolios as of december  however  no assurance can be given that the company will not  in any particular period  sustain loan and lease losses that are sizable in relation to the amount reserved  or that subsequent evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio  in light of factors then prevailing  including economic conditions  the company s ongoing credit review process or regulatory requirements  will not require significant changes in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
among other factors  a continued economic slowdown and or a decline in commercial or residential real estate values in the company s markets may have an adverse impact on the current adequacy of the a llowance for loan and lease losses by increasing credit risk and the risk of potential loss 
the total allowance for loan and lease losses is generally available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
the allocation of the company s allowance for loan and lease losses disclosed in the asset quality table is subject to change based on the changes in criteria used to evaluate the allowance and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future losses in any particular portfolio 
the discussion and analysis included in this section contains detailed information regarding the company s allowance for loan and lease losses  net charge offs  non performing assets  past due loans and leases and potential problem loans and leases 
included in this data are numerous portfolio ratios that must be carefully reviewed in relation to the nature of the underlying loan and lease portfolios before appropriate conclusions can be reached regarding the company or for purposes of making comparisons to other banks 
most of the company s non performing assets and past due loans are secured by real estate 
given the nature of these assets and the related mortgage foreclosure  property sale and  if applicable  mortgage insurance claims processes  it can take months or longer for a loan to migrate from initial delinquen cy to final disposition 
this resolution process generally takes much longer for loans secured by real estate than for unsecured loans or loans secured by other property primarily due to state real estate foreclosure laws 

table of contents the company categorizes all business and commercial purpose loans into risk categories based on relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information  historical payment experience  credit documentation  public information  and current economic trends  among other factors 
the company analyzes loans individually by setting the risk grade at the inception of a loan through the approval process 
the definitions used were refined in early the risk grades are formally affirmed quarterly by loan officers 
in addition  a certain percentage of business purpose dollars is reviewed each year through the company s loan review process 
the risk rating process is inherently subjective and based upon management s evaluation of the specific facts and circumstances for individual borrowers 
as such  the assigned risk ratings are subject to change based upon changes in borrower status and changes in the external environment affecting the borrower 
the company uses the following definitions for risk ratings risk grade prime risk 
loss potential is rated as none or extremely low 
loans fully secured by deposit accounts at the company s subsidiary bank will also be rated as risk grade risk grade excellent risk 
loss potential is demonstrably low 
loans have liquid financial statements or are secured by marketable securities or other liquid collateral 
risk grade good risk 
loss potential is low 
asset quality and liquidity are considered good 
overall leverage and liquidity measures are better than the industry in which the borrower operates and they are stable 
risk grade average risk 
loss potential is low  but evidence of risk exists 
margins and cash flow generally equal or exceed industry norm and policy guidelines  but some inconsistency may be evident 
asset quality is average with liquidity comparable to industry norms 
leverage may be slightly higher than the industry  but is stable 
risk grade marginal risk 
loss potential is variable  but there is potential for deterioration 
asset quality is marginally acceptable 
leverage may fluctuate and is above normal for the industry 
cash flow is marginally adequate 
risk grade special mention 
loss potential moderate if corrective action not taken 
evidence of declining revenues or margins  inadequate cash flow  and possibly high leverage or tightening liquidity 
risk grade substandard 
distinct possibility of loss to the bank  but no discernable impairment 
repayment ability of borrower is weak and the loan may have exhibited excessive overdue status  extension  or renewals 
risk grade doubtful 
loss potential is extremely high 
ability of the borrower to service the debt is weak  constant overdue status  loan has been placed on non accrual status and no definitive repayment schedule exists 
risk grade loss 
loans are considered fully uncollectible and charged off 
the company utilizes its nine point grading system in order to evaluate the level of inherent risk in the loan portfolio as part of its allowance for loan losses methodology 
loans collectively evaluated for impairment are grouped by loan type and  in the case of commercial and construction loans  by risk rating 
each loan type is assigned an allowance factor based on risk grade  historical loss experience  economic conditions  overall portfolio quality including delinquency rates and commercial real estate loan concentrations as applicable 
loans graded or worse are assigned an additional reserve factor stated in basis points in order to account for the added inherent risk 
additional basis points are applied as a reserve factor to the loan balances as the corresponding loan grades indic ate additional risk and increase from grade to grade 
table of contents accrued losses associated with mortgage indemnifications and repurchases when the company is notified by an investor that there is an inherent loss and an underwriting exception associated with a mortgage loan previously sold by the company to the investor  the company goes through a process to determine if it is probable that the loss will need to be absorbed by the company and if the loss is able to be estimated 
the company accrues the related loss if management determines that it is probable that the loss will be recognized by the company and it is able to be estimated 
members of the company s management meet monthly to discuss outstanding notices received from its investors and documents the associated probability of loss being recognized and any estimation o f the associated loss to determine the amount that should be accrued 
at december   thousand of losses associated with mortgage repurchases and indemnifications was accrued 
additionally  losses of million and million were recognized during the years ended december  and  respectively 
there were no such losses recognized during deferred taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
if current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance may be established 
management considers the determination of this valuation allowance to be a critical accounting policy due to the need to exercise significa nt judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of deferred tax liabilities and assets  including projections of future taxable income 
these judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets may be required if the amounts of taxes recoverable through loss carry backs decline  or if management projects lower levels of future taxable income 
if such a valuation allowance is deemed necessary in the future  it would be established through a charge to income tax expense that would adversely affect operating results 
foreclosed assets foreclosed assets represent properties acquired through foreclosure or physical possession 
write downs to fair value of foreclosed assets at the time of transfer are charged to allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to foreclosure  the company periodically evaluates the value of foreclosed assets held for sale and records an impairment charge for any subsequent declines in fair value less selling costs 
subsequent declines in value are charged to operations 
fair value is based on an assessment of information available at the end of a reporting period and depends upon a number of factors  including historical experience  economic conditions  and issues specific to individual properties 
the evaluation of these factors involves subjective estimates and judgments that may change 
goodwill and intangible assets the company recorded the assets and liabilities of fnb corporation as of february  at estimated fair value 
several third party specialists were engaged to assist in valuing certain financial assets and liabilities 
the company recorded approximately million in goodwill associated with this transaction 
previously  legacy vfg recorded goodwill of million in connection with the purchase of branches in the fall of  resulting in an aggregate goodwill balance of million 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  the company uses both the income and market approaches to value its reporting units 
the income approach consists of discounting long term projected future cash flows  which are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for the commercial banking segment 
the company engaged a third party to assist management in the testing for impairment of the goodwill and intangible assets as of the annual assessment date  which is september the projected future cash flows are discounted using cost of capital metrics for the company s peer group or a build up approach such as the capital asset pricing model 
the market approach applies a market multiple  based on observed purchase transactions and or price earnings of the company s peer group for the reporting un it  to the last twelve months of net income or earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization or price tangible book value 
testing goodwill for impairment is a two step process 
the first step step one of the goodwill impairment test  which the company has employed in its analysis  involves estimating the fair value of the equity of the reporting unit 
for purposes of this assignment  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
this type of value reflects the premise of value of value in use 
value in use is derived from the on going operations of the business 
the fair value is then compared to the reporting unit s carrying value of equity 
in the event a reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value  evidence of potential impairment exists 
in such a case  the second step step two of the impairment test is required  which involves allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  with the excess of fair value over allocated net assets representing the fair value of its goodwill 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount  if any  by which the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of that goodwill 

table of contents in  based on the results of step one of the impairment test  the company determined that the carrying amount of goodwill would have exceeded its estimated fair value at the valuation date 
because the carrying amount exceeded the fair value  the company engaged a third party to assist management in performing step two of the goodwill impairment test as of september  with the assistance of a third party  the implied fair value of goodwill was determined by assigning the fair value to all of the assets and liabilities  including any unrecognized intangible assets  as if the company s commercial banking segment had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess of the fair value of the commercial banking segment over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
based on the results of step two of the impairment test as of september   management determined that goodwill was not impaired 
management reviewed the reports prepared by the third party as of september   considered the factors noted above that could lead to impairment between that date and december  and evaluated the trading level of the company s stock in relation to both its book value and tangible book value 
based on these inputs  management concluded that no indications of impairment were present 
should management determine in a future period that the goodwill recorded in connection with acquisitions has been impaired  then a charge to earnings will be recorded in the period such determination is made 
long lived assets  including purchased intangible assets subject to amortization  such as the core deposit intangible asset  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
management concluded that no circumstances indicating an impairment of these assets existed as of the balance sheet date 
non gaap financial measures this report refers to the efficiency ratio  which is computed by dividing noninterest expense less amortization of intangibles  foreclosed property expense  and goodwill impairments as a percent of the sum of net interest income on a tax equivalent basis and noninterest income excluding only gains on securities 
the efficiency ratio is not a recognized reporting measure under usgaap 
management believes this measure provides investors with important information regarding the company s operational efficiency 
management believes such financial information is meaningful to the reader in understanding operating performance  but cautions that such information not be viewed as a substitute for usgaap 
the company  in referring to its net income  is referring to income under usgaap 
comparison of the efficiency ratio with those of other companies may not be possible  because other companies may calculate the efficiency ratio differently
