item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the heading item a 
risk factors 
management overview our long term financial focus is primarily on sustainable growth in free cash flow non gaap free cash flow is primarily driven by increasing our operating income and efficiently managing working capital and capital expenditures 
increases in operating income primarily result from increases in sales through our websites  improvements in operating margins and the efficient management of operating costs  offset by the investments that we make in longer term strategic initiatives 
commitment to customer service our focus is on delivering an unparalleled customer experience 
we design our websites to offer easy to understand  step by step guides to visualizing  evaluating  selecting and purchasing diamonds and fine jewelry 
we continue to refine the customer service experience in every step of the purchase process from our websites to our customer support  product quality and fulfillment operations 
our customer support centers are staffed with non commissioned diamond and jewelry consultants who offer advice and guidance to customers via phone  chat or email 
our diamond and jewelry consultants are subject to ongoing training and carry expertise about diamonds and fine jewelry 
we continue to invest in optimizing our fulfillment operations to ensure that our customized products can be delivered as soon as one business day  but generally within three business days of order 
customer feedback and customer satisfaction ratings are among the key non financial measures we review 
we believe that maintaining high overall customer satisfaction is critical to customer referrals and our ongoing efforts to elevate the blue nile brand and to increase our net sales and net income 
we actively solicit customer feedback on our website functionality as well as on the entire purchase experience 
differentiating factors and value proposition we have built an innovative business model designed to deliver exceptional value and service to customers 
we have developed relationships with a large number of diamond suppliers with whom we have exclusive agreements as an online retailer 
our unique inventory model allows us to offer our customers access to a large selection of high quality diamonds 
in most cases  we purchase diamonds from our suppliers only as our customers place orders from us 
as a result  we do not incur the significant costs that would be incurred by physical retail stores to carry high levels of diamond inventory 
our efficient operating model also provides for negative working capital benefits  since payments are received from customers within a few days of shipment of their order  but our vendor payment terms are typically in the day range 
as an online retailer  we also do not incur most of the operating costs associated with physical retail stores  including occupancy costs and related overhead 
as a result  while our gross profit margins are lower than those typically maintained by traditional diamond and fine jewelry retailers  we are able to realize relatively higher operating income as a percentage of net sales 
in the year ended january   we had a gross profit margin  as compared to what we believe to be gross profit margins of up to or more by some traditional jewelry retailers 
our lower gross profit margins result from lower retail prices that we offer to our customers 
we believe that these lower prices  in turn  will result in increasing our market share in the luxury jewelry retail space 
blue nile defines free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  as net cash provided by used in operating activities less cash outflows for purchases of fixed assets  including internal use software and website development 

table of contents focus on growth a customer s first purchase from blue nile is often an engagement ring 
our goal is to provide an unrivaled customer experience such that we become our customers jeweler for life 
we have continued to expand our product lines to include non engagement diamond jewelry as well as other products such as pearls  gemstones and various silver  gold and platinum offerings and watches 
expansion of our product lines has allowed us to broaden our reach with a wider range of price points and merchandise offerings  attracting new customers to our brand 
our satisfied customers are an important source of referrals that we believe will further drive growth 
during  we launched a mobile website designed for iphone  ipod touch and android mobile device users 
we also launched a free diamond shopping application for iphone and ipod touch 
the iphone app and mobile website allow consumers to browse our educational materials  search for diamonds and jewelry  connect to our diamond and jewelry consultants and make a purchase through their mobile device 
we believe this blend of convenience and real time  transparent and in depth information enhances our customer experience 
further  we increased our marketing and public relations efforts via social media such as facebook  to create a unique customer experience to celebrate the holidays and to enhance customer awareness 
we plan to continue to pursue these opportunities and offerings to expand brand awareness and increase our market share 
we intend to selectively pursue opportunities in international markets in which we can leverage our existing infrastructure and value proposition 
in  our international sales grew compared to and represented of our sales for the year 
international growth is a priority and we will continue to pursue international growth opportunities based on a number of factors  including  but not limited to  each market s consumer spending on diamonds and jewelry  adoption rate of online purchasing and overall competitive landscape 
trends throughout  the macroeconomic conditions affected our business 
although us consumer confidence improved in the fourth quarter  high levels of unemployment  unpredictable consumer behavior  economic volatility abroad and various other factors affected consumer spending in these conditions continue to have an impact on consumer spending  including the sale of luxury products such as diamonds and fine jewelry 
our low cost business model provides us the flexibility to operate profitably throughout the difficult consumer environment while the industry as a whole has struggled 
we believe that our broad selection  focus on exceptional service and the value that we offer resonated with consumers  as demonstrated by our sales and earnings growth in fiscal year critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make certain estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported and disclosed in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following are the critical accounting policies that we believe require significant estimation and management judgment 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue and the related gross profit on the date on which ownership passes from blue nile to our customers 
for customers in the us  canada and the us  ownership passes at the time the package is received by the customer 
for customers in other locations  ownership passes at the time the product is shipped 
as we require customer payment prior to order shipment  any payments received prior to the transfer of ownership are not recorded as revenue 
for us  canadian and eu shipments  we utilize our freight vendors tracking information to determine when delivery has occurred  which is typically within one to three days after shipment 
we reduce revenue by a provision for returns  which is estimated based on our historical 
table of contents product return rates and current economic conditions 
our contracts with our suppliers generally allow us to return diamonds purchased and returned by our customers 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation at fair value 
we use the black scholes merton option valuation model  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term and the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term expected volatility 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the estimate of the fair value of employee stock options and consequently  the related amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
we performed the following sensitivity analysis using changes in the expected term and expected volatility that could be reasonably possible in the near term 
if we assumed a six month increase or decrease in the expected term or a basis point increase or decrease in expected volatility  the value of a newly granted hypothetical stock option would increase decrease by the following percentages increase decrease expected term expected volatility sensitivity to change in assumptions was determined using the black scholes merton valuation model compared to the following original assumptions stock price and exercise price equal to the closing market price of blue nile  inc common stock on december   expected term of years  expected volatility of  expected dividend yield of and a risk free interest rate of 
in addition  we estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize stock based compensation expense for grants that are expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience 
to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  stock based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
results of operations the following table presents our historical operating results for the periods indicated as a percentage of net sales year ended year ended year ended january  january  january  net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other income  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income the following describes certain items set forth in our consolidated statements of operations net sales 
substantially all of our net sales consist of diamonds and fine jewelry sold via the internet  net of estimated returns 
historically  net sales have been higher in the fourth quarter as a result of higher 
table of contents consumer spending during the holiday season 
we expect this seasonal trend to continue in the foreseeable future 
gross profit 
our gross profit consists of net sales less the cost of sales 
our cost of sales includes the cost of merchandise sold to customers  inbound and outbound shipping costs  depreciation on assembly related assets  insurance on shipments and the costs incurred to set diamonds into ring  earring and pendant settings  including labor and related facilities costs 
our gross profit has fluctuated historically and we expect it to continue to fluctuate based primarily on our product acquisition costs  product mix and pricing decisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related benefit costs for our employees  stock based compensation  marketing costs and credit card fees 
these expenses also include certain facility related costs  and fulfillment  customer service  technology and depreciation expenses  as well as professional fees and other general corporate expenses 
fiscal year 
our fiscal year generally ends on the sunday closest to december each fiscal year consists of four week quarters  with one extra week added in the fourth quarter every five to six years 
our fiscal year included one extra week in the fourth quarter  or weeks for the fiscal year  as a result of our retail reporting calendar

table of contents shipped to customers 
sales of our non engagement jewelry grew at a rate above our overall sales growth rate 
year over year sales trends started strong in the first quarter but slowed down considerably in the third quarter as us consumers pulled back on spending over concerns about high unemployment rates  limited access to credit and other macroeconomic factors 
us consumer confidence improved in the fourth quarter and combined with our increased marketing and public relations efforts  and expanded product offerings during the holiday season  sales grew to million in the fourth quarter  a record high for any quarter in the company s history 
net sales in the us increased by to million in compared with million in the prior year 
international sales increased to million for the year ended january   compared to million for the year ended january  increased marketing efforts and expanded brand awareness contributed to the increase in us and international sales 
the strength of foreign currencies against the us dollar also contributed to international sales growth 
internally  we monitor our international sales performance on a non gaap basis which eliminates the positive or negative effects that result from translating international sales into us dollars constant exchange rate basis 
international sales growth was positively impacted approximately due to changes in foreign exchange rates in compared to the rates in effect during excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates  international sales increased in the year ended january  gross profit gross profit increased million or in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  the increase in gross profit is primarily due to the increase in net sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales was equivalent to the prior year at in the year ended january  compared to in the year ended january  costs for our jewelry products are impacted by prices for diamonds and precious metals  including gold  platinum and silver  which rise and fall based upon global supply and demand dynamics 
in making retail pricing decisions  we take into account fluctuations in the pricing of diamonds and precious metals  which in turn  affect the gross margin that we realize from such products 
while prices for diamonds and precious metals will continue to fluctuate based upon global supply and demand dynamics  we cannot adequately predict the amount and timing of any such fluctuations 
we expect that gross profit will fluctuate in the future based on changes in product acquisition costs  particularly diamond prices  product mix and pricing decisions 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended january  compared to million in the year ended january  due to several factors 
marketing and advertising costs increased million  primarily due to increased investment in online marketing and public relations to drive brand awareness and traffic in support of our growth initiatives 
compensation and related expenses increased million due to increased headcount in support of key business initiatives and growth in sales volumes  partially offset by lower year over year incentive accruals 
credit card interchange and payment processing fees increased million based upon higher sales volume 
depreciation expense related to additional capitalized assets added approximately million to expenses 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were for each of the years ended january  and january  other income  net the decrease in interest income for the year ended january  as compared with the year ended january  was due to lower interest rates  partially offset by higher overall cash balances 
income taxes the effective income tax rate for the year ended january  was due to lower taxable income in fiscal year as compared to for the year ended january  
table of contents comparison of year ended january  to year ended january  net sales net sales increased in the year ended january   compared with the year ended january  excluding the additional week of sales included in  net sales would have increased in when compared to the prior year 
the increase in net sales was due to an increase in the average retail value per order shipped  partially offset by a decrease in the number of orders shipped to customers 
year over year sales trends improved each quarter of the year culminating with strong performance in the fourth quarter of  which had sales growth 
net sales in the us increased by to million in compared with million in the prior year 
international sales increased to million for the year ended january   compared to million for the year ended january  our core bridal jewelry category experienced sales trends consistent with the overall business 
sales of our non engagement jewelry  which is more discretionary  were more impacted by the pullback in consumer spending and were weak in the first half of our non engagement jewelry sales began to improve in the third quarter and strengthened considerably in the fourth quarter holiday season 
international sales contributed significantly to the overall increase in net sales in  representing of the sales growth 
in  we enhanced our websites  expanding our customers ability to shop and transact in additional foreign currencies 
we believe this expansion  increased marketing efforts and expanded brand awareness contributed to the increase in our international sales in compared to international sales growth was negatively impacted approximately due to changes in foreign exchange rates in compared to the rates in effect during excluding the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates  international sales increased in the year ended january  gross profit gross profit increased million or in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january   primarily due to the million increase in net sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased by basis points to in the year ended january  compared to in the year ended january  the increase in gross profit as a percentage of sales is attributable to the continued emphasis on cost optimization related to product sourcing and product sales mix 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in the year ended january  compared to million in the year ended january  due to several factors 
incentive compensation was approximately million compared to zero in the prior year

depreciation expense related to additional capitalized assets added approximately million to expenses 
credit card processing fees increased million due to higher sales volumes 
stock based compensation expense increased approximately million primarily due to lower expenses in the prior year related to forfeited options of former employees 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in marketing and advertising costs primarily related to decreased spending in online marketing vehicles and a million decrease in legal expenses due to lower spending on intellectual property and other corporate matters 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended january  and january   respectively 
other income  net the decrease in interest income for the year ended january  as compared with the year ended january  was due to lower interest rates 

table of contents income taxes the effective income tax rate for the year ended january  was as compared to for the year ended january  liquidity and capital resources we are primarily funded by our cash flows from operations 
the significant components of our working capital are inventory and liquid assets such as cash and trade accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable and accrued expenses 
our business model provides certain beneficial working capital characteristics 
while we collect cash from sales to customers within several business days of the related sale  we typically have extended payment terms with our suppliers 
our liquidity is primarily dependent upon our net cash from operating activities 
our net cash from operating activities is sensitive to many factors  including changes in working capital 
working capital at any specific point in time is dependent upon many variables  including our operating results  seasonality  inventory management and assortment expansion  the timing of cash receipts and payments  and vendor payment terms 
as of january   working capital totaled million  consisting of cash and cash equivalents of million  inventory of million and other current assets totaling approximately million  offset by accounts payable of million and other current liabilities totaling approximately million 
due to the seasonal nature of our business  cash and cash equivalents  inventory and accounts payable are generally higher in the fourth quarter  resulting in fluctuations in our working capital 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended january  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the year ended january  and net cash used in operating activities of million in the year ended january  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended january  was primarily attributable to higher net income and the tax benefits realized upon the exercise of stock options 
the tax benefit realized from options exercises  which represent the tax deductions in excess of stock compensation expense recorded in the financial statements  increased to million in the year ended january   from million in the year ended january  due to the number of options exercised and the market price of our common stock 
the increase in cash was also due to the working capital dynamics of our model associated with the increase in sales in the fourth quarter and the resulting build up in accounts payable 
accounts payable increased by million in the year ended january  compared to an increase of million in the year ended january  we experience greater cash flow from operations in our fourth quarter compared to other quarters due to the significant increase in revenue from our holiday sales 
in the first quarter we typically have a significant pay down of our accounts payable balance that was accumulated during the fourth quarter holiday season 
these increases were partially offset by a lower cash benefit provided by changes in accrued liabilities 
accrued liabilities increased by million in the year ended january  compared to a net increase of million in the year ended january  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  was primarily attributable to the increase in accounts payable of million in the year ended january  compared to a decrease of million in the year ended january  similarly  accrued liabilities increased million at january  compared to a net decrease of million in the year ended january  tax benefits realized upon the exercise of stock options increased to million in the year ended january   from million in the year ended january  due to the number of options exercised and the market price of our common stock 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in working capital from inventory of million for the year ended january  compared to a net increase in working capital from inventory of million for the year ended january  net cash of million was provided by investing activities in the year ended january   due to the maturity of million in short term investments  partially offset by purchases of million in property and equipment 
net cash of million was used in investing activities in the year ended january  
table of contents due to the purchase of million in short term investments and million of property and equipment 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended january  was due to the net purchase of property and equipment 
our capital needs are generally minimal and include investments in technology and websites enhancements  capital improvements to our leased warehouse and office facilities  and furniture and equipment 
additionally  we have the ability to reduce and or delay capital investments in challenging economic conditions without significant disruption to our business or operations 
over the next months  we expect to purchase property and equipment in connection with our new corporate office space resulting in higher capital expenditures in compared to net cash used by financing activities in the year ended january  was million  primarily related to the repurchases of common stock 
this was partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises of million 
during the year ended january  we repurchased million shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
since the inception of our buyback programs in the first quarter of through january   we have repurchased million shares for a total of million 
shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions or in negotiated transactions off the market 
the timing and amount of any shares repurchased are determined by management based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors 
repurchases may also be made under a rule b plan 
we continually assess market conditions  our cash position  operating results  current forecasts and other factors when making decisions about stock repurchases 
net cash provided by financing activities in the year ended january  was million  primarily related to the proceeds from stock option exercises 
net cash used in financing activities in the year ended january  was million  related to the repurchase of our common stock and partially offset by proceeds from stock option exercises 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and the expected effect on liquidity and cash flows as of january  in thousands 
less than over contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases financing obligation purchase obligations purchase obligations on january   we entered a lease agreement for our new corporate headquarters  which we plan to occupy on may upon the expiration of our current lease 
future rental obligations for the new office lease are not included in the table and are as follows in thousands less than year   years   years and  over years 
includes open merchandise purchase orders at january  includes commitments for advertising and marketing and other services at january  we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
we do not carry any long or short term debt 
however  projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to many factors and to uncertainty 
we continually assess our capital structure and opportunities to obtain credit facilities  sell equity or debt securities  or undertake other transactions for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
however  there can be no assurance that additional equity  debt or other financing transactions will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements at january   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements or relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purposes entities  which are typically established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
impact of inflation the effect of inflation and changing prices on our operations was not significant during the periods presented 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk the majority of our revenue  expense and capital expenditures are transacted in us dollars 
our customers ability to purchase our products in foreign currencies exposes us to foreign currency exchange risk from the transaction date to when the cash is ultimately converted to us dollars 
because the majority of foreign currency transactions are through third party credit cards that settle within three to four business days  the impact of foreign currency exchange was not material to our results of operations for the fiscal years ended january  and january  the functional currency of jewellery  our irish subsidiary is the euro 
assets and liabilities of jewellery are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the end of the period 
income and expenses are translated into us dollars at an average exchange rate during the period 
foreign currency gains and losses from the translation of jewellery s balance sheet and income statement at january  was a net translation loss of million that was recognized in other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk we are exposed to financial market risk that results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates 
we maintain the majority of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in accounts with major financial institutions within and outside the united states  in the form of demand deposits  money market accounts and other short term investments 
deposits in these institutions may exceed the amounts of insurance provided  or deposits may not at all be covered by insurance 
to date  we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in short term  high quality  interest bearing securities 
to minimize our exposure to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain an average maturity of one year or less 
if interest rates had averaged basis points higher than they did in the year ended january   interest income for the year would have increased approximately  or million 
if interest rates had averaged basis points higher than they did in the year ended january   interest income for the year would have increased approximately  or million
