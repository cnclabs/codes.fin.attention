table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
outlook invacare returned to organic net sales growth in and plans to increase the growth rate in as the company shifts to a global operating model  it intends to leverage its regional product strengths into its other geographic markets 
for example  the company will be introducing a new bath lift in the united states that was developed and has already enjoyed success in europe 
the company also has identified a number of internal opportunities to reduce complexity and drive organic net sales 
for instance  the company is integrating its motion concepts seating and positioning subsidiary with its existing invacare branded seating products 
the combined efforts of the invacare and motion concepts teams are expected to lead to improved product design through one product development center  an enhanced sales organization that is focused on one united goal and greater ease in sales and technical support for customers 
similarly  the company intends to deploy its research and development efforts more efficiently to accelerate new product introductions that are expected to show benefits during the year 
for instance  the new invacare fdx power wheelchair  launched in europe and the united states in  is the company s first global power wheelchair platform and it has already started to gain traction with clinicians and providers 
the company will benefit from interest savings in  as a result of paying down higher interest rate debt  namely the million of senior notes retired in the fourth quarter of however  this benefit will be partially offset by a number of items 
first  the new revolving credit facility entered into by the company in october bears a higher interest rate than the previous revolving credit facility 
second  the company s indebtedness has increased as a result of the debt finance charges  premium and fees paid during to extinguish the previous debt structure 
in addition  the new credit facility affords invacare the opportunity to pursue acquisitions or buy back company stock 
the company s organic net sales growth and interest savings will likely be partially offset by the potential for continued increases in freight and commodity costs  particularly in aluminum and steel  which are already being incurred in additionally  as invacare plans for its business in the united states to continue to improve  the company s overall effective tax rate on adjusted pre tax earnings is expected to increase  since the united states tax rate is the highest of the countries in which it does business 
the company anticipates continued volatility related to foreign exchange rates which could be a benefit or a detriment 
the company may also manage potential increases in libor rates by entering into interest rate swap agreements to fix some of its exposure 
in regards to reimbursement  the company is mindful of three key issues 
in the united states  the centers for medicaid and medicare services is moving forward with national competitive bidding in the first nine metropolitan areas 
while the company expects this to be neutral to earnings in  it will remain judicious in its extension of credit to customers and it will monitor whether other payors begin to model their payments on this system 
the company also will closely watch state medicaid budgets and how deficits may impact coverage and payments for home medical equipment and institutional care products 
in the european segment  there is discussion by the french government of reduced wheelchair reimbursement in the second half of this issue was originally anticipated to occur in  but it was delayed 
as part of its regulatory function  the fda routinely inspects the sites of medical device companies  and in  the fda inspected certain of the company s facilities 
in december  the company received a warning letter from the food and drug administration fda related to documentation and procedures at the company s sanford  florida facility 
the letter does not call into question the safety or efficacy of invacare products  and production has not been impacted 
the company is taking these issues very seriously and has added resources to ensure it is addressing all of the fda s concerns in a timely manner 
the costs related to making the process improvements are not expected to be material and have been included in the company s operating plan and guidance

as is the case for many companies operating in the current economic environment  the company is exposed to a number of risks

critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements included in the report include accounts of the company and all majority owned subsidiaries

in preparing the financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
however  application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition invacare s revenues are recognized when products are shipped to unaffiliated customers 
revenue recognition  asc  provides guidance on the application of generally accepted accounting principles to selected revenue recognition issues 
the company has concluded that its revenue recognition policy is appropriate and in accordance with gaap and asc shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
sales are made only to customers with whom the company believes collection is reasonably assured based upon a credit analysis  which may include obtaining a credit application  a signed security agreement  personal guarantee and or a cross corporate guarantee depending on the credit history of the customer 
credit lines are established for new customers after an evaluation of their credit report and or other relevant financial information 
existing credit lines are regularly reviewed and adjusted with consideration given to any outstanding past due amounts 
the company offers discounts and rebates  which are accounted for as reductions to revenue in the period in which the sale is recognized 
discounts offered include cash discounts for prompt payment  base and trade discounts based on contract level for specific classes of customers 
volume discounts and rebates are given based on large purchases and the achievement of certain sales volumes 
product returns are accounted for as a reduction to reported sales with estimates recorded for anticipated returns at the time of sale 
the company does not ship any goods on consignment 
distributed products sold by the company are accounted for in accordance with the revenue recognition guidance in asc the company records distributed product sales gross as a principal since the company takes title to the products and has the risks of loss for collections  delivery and returns

table of contents invacare customers 
as such  interest income is recognized based on the terms of the installment agreements 
installment accounts are monitored and if a customer defaults on payments  interest income is no longer recognized 
all installment accounts are accounted for using the same methodology  regardless of duration of the installment agreements 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on management s evaluation of the financial condition of the customer 
in addition  as a result of the third party financing arrangement  management monitors the collection status of these contracts in accordance with the company s limited recourse obligations and provides amounts necessary for estimated losses in the allowance for doubtful accounts and establishing reserves for specific customers as needed 
the company continues to closely monitor the credit worthiness of its customers and adhere to tight credit policies

the single payment amounts will be used to determine the price that medicare pays for certain durable medical equipment  prosthetics  orthotics and supplies 
the program replaces medicare s existing fee schedule amounts with market based prices 
the company believes the changes announced could have a significant impact on the collectability of accounts receivable for those customers which are in the msa locations impacted and which have a portion of their revenues tied to medicare reimbursement 
as a result  this is an additional risk factor which the company considers when assessing the collectability of accounts receivable 
invacare has an agreement with dll  a third party financing company  to provide the majority of future lease financing to invacare s north america customers 
the dll agreement provides for direct leasing between dll and the invacare customer 
the company retains a recourse obligation for events of default under the contracts 
the company monitors the collections status of these contracts and has provided amounts for estimated losses in its allowances for doubtful accounts 
inventories and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined by the first in  first out method 
inventories have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimated allowance is based on management s review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
a provision for excess and obsolete inventory is recorded as needed based upon the discontinuation of products  redesigning of existing products  new product introductions  market changes and safety issues 
both raw materials and finished goods are reserved for on the balance sheet 
in general  invacare reviews inventory turns as an indicator of obsolescence or slow moving product as well as the impact of new product introductions 
depending on the situation  the company may partially or fully reserve for the individual item

goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets property  equipment  certain intangibles and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives

under intangibles goodwill and other  asc  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests 
furthermore  goodwill and other long lived assets are reviewed for i 
table of contents impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
the company completes its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year 
the discount rates used have a significant impact upon the discounted cash flow methodology utilized in the company s annual impairment testing as higher discount rates decrease the fair value estimates 
the company utilizes a discounted cash flow method model to analyze reporting units for impairment in which the company forecasts income statement and balance sheet amounts based on assumptions regarding future sales growth  profitability  inventory turns  days sales outstanding  etc 
to forecast future cash flows 
the cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital discount rate where the cost of debt is based on quoted rates for year debt of companies of similar credit risk and the cost of equity is based upon the year treasury rate for the risk free rate  a market risk premium  the industry average beta and a small cap stock adjustment 
the assumptions used are based on a market participant s point of view and yielded a discount rate of in compared to in and to in the company also utilizes an ev enterprise value to ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization method to compute the fair value of its reporting units which considers potential acquirers and their ev to ebitda multiples adjusted by an estimated premium 
while more weight is given to the discounted cash flow method  the ev to ebitda method does provide corroborative evidence of the reasonableness of the discounted cash flow method results 
while there was no indication of impairment in related to goodwill  a future potential impairment is possible for any of the company s reporting units should actual results differ materially from forecasted results used in the valuation analysis 
furthermore  the company s annual valuation of goodwill can differ materially if the market inputs used to determine the discount rate change significantly 
for instance  higher interest rates or greater stock price volatility would increase the discount rate and thus increase the chance of impairment 
for example  if the discount rate used were basis points higher for the impairment analysis  there still would not be any indicator of potential impairment for any of the reporting units

product liability reserves are recorded for individual claims based upon historical experience  industry expertise and indications from the third party actuary 
additional reserves  in excess of the specific individual case reserves  are provided for incurred but not reported claims based upon third party actuarial valuations at the time such valuations are conducted 
historical claims experience and other assumptions are taken into consideration by the third party actuary to estimate the ultimate reserves 
for example  the actuarial analysis assumes that historical loss experience is an indicator of future experience  that the distribution of exposures by geographic area and nature of operations for ongoing operations is expected to be very similar to historical operations with no dramatic changes and that the government indices used to trend losses and exposures are appropriate 
estimates made are adjusted on a regular basis and can be impacted by actual loss awards and settlements on claims 
while actuarial analysis is used to help determine adequate reserves  the company is responsible for the determination and recording of adequate reserves in accordance with accepted loss reserving standards and practices
