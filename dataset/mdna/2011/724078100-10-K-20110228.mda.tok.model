executive overview our business principally consists of providing investment banking  institutional brokerage  asset management and related financial services to corporations  private equity groups  public entities  non profit entities and institutional investors in the united states  europe and asia 
we operate through two reportable business segments capital markets the capital markets segment provides institutional sales  trading and research services and investment banking services 
institutional sales  trading and research services focus on the trading of equity and fixed income products with institutions  government  and non profit entities 
revenues are generated through commissions and sales credits earned on equity and fixed income institutional sales activities  net interest revenues on trading securities held in inventory  profits and losses from trading these securities and strategic trading opportunities 
investment banking services include management of and participation in underwritings  merger and acquisition services and public finance activities 
revenues are generated through the receipt of advisory and financing fees 
asset management the asset management segment provides asset management services with product offerings in equity and fixed income securities to institutions and high net worth individuals through proprietary distribution channels 
it generates revenues in the form of management and performance fees 
the majority of our performance fees  if earned  are recognized in the fourth quarter 
as part of our growth strategy  we expanded our asset management business through the acquisition of advisory research  inc ari  a chicago based asset management firm 
the transaction closed on march  for more information on our acquisition of ari  see note of the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our business is a human capital business 
accordingly  compensation and benefits comprise the largest component of our expenses  and our performance is dependent upon our ability to attract  develop and retain highly skilled employees who are motivated and committed to providing the highest quality of service and guidance to our clients 
results for the year ended december  for the year ended december   we recorded net income of million  or per diluted common share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted common share  for the prior year 
net revenues for the year ended december  were million  up percent from million reported in increased revenues from equity financings  advisory services and asset management  driven by our acquisition of ari  were partially offset by lower institutional brokerage revenues 
for the year ended december   non interest expense increased percent to million  compared to this increase was primarily due to higher compensation costs  charges related to restructuring the firm s european operations and the addition of ari  including amortization expense on customer contract intangible assets recorded in conjunction with the acquisition

external factors impacting our business performance in the financial services industry in which we operate is highly correlated to the overall strength of economic conditions and financial market activity 
overall market conditions are a product of many factors  which are beyond our control and mostly unpredictable 
these factors may affect the financial decisions made by investors  including their level of participation in the financial markets 
in turn  these decisions may affect our business results 
with respect to financial market activity  our profitability is sensitive to a variety of factors  including the demand for investment banking services as reflected by the number and size of equity and debt financings and merger and acquisition transactions  the volatility of the equity and fixed income markets  changes in interest rates especially rapid and extreme changes  the level and shape of various yield curves  the volume and value of trading in securities  and the demand for asset management services as reflected by the amount of assets under management 
factors that differentiate our business within the financial services industry also may affect our financial results 
for example  our business focuses on a middle market clientele in specific industry sectors 
if the business environment for our focus sectors is impacted disproportionately as compared to the economy as a whole  or does not recover on pace with other sectors of the economy  our business and results of operations will be negatively impacted 
in addition  our business could be affected differently than overall market trends 
given the variability of the capital markets and securities businesses  our earnings may fluctuate significantly from period to period  and results for any individual period should not be considered indicative of future results 
as a participant in the financial services industry  we are subject to complex and extensive regulation of our business 
in recent years and following the credit crisis of  legislators and regulators increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry  resulting in fundamental changes to the manner in which the industry is regulated and increased regulation in a number of areas 
for example  the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act was enacted in bringing sweeping change to financial services regulation in the us changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate could affect our business and the competitive environment  potentially adversely 

table of contents outlook for during  market conditions continued to improve as the macroeconomic environment strengthened 
equity financing revenues improved significantly and advisory services revenues continued trending upward as the equity market showed increasing momentum  particularly in the fourth quarter 
if the markets remain favorable in  growth sectors of equity capital markets and advisory services should benefit 
however  we are cautious about the potential for volatile periods in the capital markets in the year ahead 
the municipal market environment at the end of was challenging with the increase in interest rates  the expiration of the build america bonds program and concerns about municipal issuer credit quality 
we anticipate that these structural headwinds in the municipal market will continue into  and consequently  that volatility in this market will continue as well 
in  we experienced reduced equity trading volumes  resulting in lower equity institutional brokerage revenues 
we expect this industry wide trend to continue in the acquisition of ari has added scale to our asset management business  provided a more stable revenue stream and a platform to support future organic growth 
restructuring of european operations in the fourth quarter of  we restructured our european operations to focus european resources on two areas the distribution of us and asia securities to european institutional investors and merger and acquisition advisory services 
as a result of the restructuring  we exited the origination and distribution of european securities and incurred a pre tax restructuring charge of million in this action allows us to redeploy resources to china  where we see significant opportunities 

table of contents results of operations financial summary the following table provides a summary of the results of our operations and the results of our operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated

table of contents for the year ended december   we recorded net income of million  which included million after tax of restructuring charges 
net revenues from continuing operations in were million  a percent increase compared to million in in  investment banking revenues increased percent to million  compared with revenues of million in  driven by increased equity financing and advisory services revenues  partially offset by a decline in debt financing revenues 
institutional brokerage revenues decreased percent to million in  from million in  due to a decline in both equity and fixed income trading revenues 
in  net interest income decreased percent to million  compared with million in the decrease was primarily the result of interest expense on the million of variable rate senior notes issued december  to finance a portion of the ari acquisition 
in  asset management fees were million  compared with million in the increased revenues were attributed to the results for ari  which we acquired on march  other income for the year ended december  was million  compared with million in the change in other income was attributable to gains recorded on our firm investments and higher income associated with the forfeitures of stock based compensation 
non interest expenses increased to million in  from million in  due to increased compensation and benefits expenses  million of restructuring expenses and incremental expenses related to the acquisition of ari 
for the year ended december   we recorded net income of million 
net revenues from continuing operations in were million  a percent increase compared to million in in  investment banking revenues increased percent to million compared with revenues of million in equity financing revenues contributed to the majority of the increase as all products  particularly registered direct offerings  reported improved performance compared to institutional brokerage revenues increased percent to million in  from million in driven by significantly higher fixed income sales and trading revenues 
in  we recorded large losses on our tender option bond tob program and high yield and structured products 
in  net interest income decreased percent to million  compared with million in the decrease was primarily the result of a decline in net interest income earned on net inventory balances as we significantly reduced our balance sheet exposure in late and early  and increased financing costs in related to our funding sources 
in  asset management fees were million  compared with million in  due to lower assets under management resulting from reduced asset valuations 
in  other income was million  essentially flat compared to non interest expenses decreased to million in  from million in in  we incurred a million pre tax charge for impairment of goodwill related to our capital markets business and million of restructuring related charges 
consolidated non interest expenses compensation and benefits compensation and benefits expenses  which are the largest component of our expenses  include salaries  incentive compensation  benefits  stock based compensation  employment taxes and other employee costs 
a portion of compensation expense is comprised of variable incentive arrangements  including discretionary incentive compensation  the amount of which fluctuates in proportion to the level of business activity  increasing with higher revenues and operating profits 
other compensation costs  primarily base salaries and benefits  are more fixed in nature 
the timing of incentive compensation payments  which generally occur in february  have a greater impact on our cash position and liquidity than is reflected in our consolidated statements of operations 
in  compensation and benefits expenses increased percent to million from million in this increase was due to higher base salaries and additional compensation expense from the acquisition of ari  partially offset by a million reversal of compensation expense associated with a performance based restricted stock award granted to our leadership team 
in the third quarter of  we deemed it improbable that we will meet the performance target of this award  requiring us to reverse the previously recognized compensation expense 
compensation and benefits expenses as a percentage of net revenues were percent for  compared with percent for excluding the million reversal of compensation expense  compensation and benefits expenses as a percentage of net revenues were percent for 
table of contents compensation and benefits expenses increased percent to million in  from million in this increase was due to higher variable compensation costs resulting from increased net revenues and profitability  offset in part by cost savings associated with restructuring related activities that occurred in late and early compensation and benefits expenses as a percentage of net revenues were percent for  compared with percent for at the end of  a significant portion of our guaranteed incentive compensation matured  resulting in a compensation structure that was more variable and better aligned with profitability and revenues in occupancy and equipment occupancy and equipment expenses were million in  compared with million in the increase was attributable to incremental occupancy costs as we transitioned to new office space in new york city and hong kong 
in  occupancy and equipment expenses were million  compared with million in the decrease was attributable to prior investments in technology and equipment becoming fully depreciated and a decrease in base rent as a result of cost saving initiatives in communications communication expenses include costs for telecommunication and data communication  primarily consisting of expenses for obtaining third party market data information 
in  communication expenses were million  compared with million in the increase was due to higher market data service expenses

marketing and business development marketing and business development expenses include travel and entertainment and promotional and advertising costs 
in  marketing and business development expenses increased percent to million  compared with million in the prior year 
this increase was driven by higher travel costs associated with increased investment banking activities and incremental expense from the acquisition of ari 
in  marketing and business development expenses decreased percent to million  compared with million in the prior year 
this decrease was due to cost saving actions taken in late  as well as a decline in employee travel expenses 
additionally  in we incurred higher travel expenses associated with write offs related to equity financings that were never completed 
outside services outside services expenses include securities processing expenses  outsourced technology functions  outside legal fees and other professional fees 
in  outside services expenses increased percent to million  compared with million in  due primarily to increased legal fees and incremental expenses from our acquisition of ari 
in  outside services expenses decreased to million  compared with million in  primarily due to reductions in legal fees and consulting costs 
also  in we changed vendors for certain outsourced technology functions  which lowered expenses associated with those functions 
offsetting a portion of this decrease was million of legal and professional fees associated with the announced acquisition of ari 
restructuring related expense in  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million  primarily related to restructuring the firm s european operations  consisting of employee severance costs  charges related to leased office space and contract termination costs related to the modification of technology contracts 
in  we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million  primarily consisting of employee severance costs and charges related to leased office space 

table of contents during  we implemented certain expense reduction measures as a means to better align our cost infrastructure with our revenues 
this resulted in a pre tax restructuring charge of million in  consisting of million in severance costs resulting from a reduction of approximately employees  million related to leased office space and million of other restructuring related expenses 
goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of  we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing  which resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million to our capital markets reporting unit 
the charge primarily related to the goodwill resulting from our acquisition by us bancorp  which was retained when we spun off as a separate public company on december  other operating expenses other operating expenses include insurance costs  license and registration fees  expenses related to our charitable giving program  amortization of intangible assets and litigation related expenses  which consist of the amounts we reserve and or pay out related to legal and regulatory matters 
in  other operating expenses were million  compared with million in this increase was primarily due to intangible amortization expense related to ari 
in  other operating expenses were million  essentially the same as income taxes in  our provision for income taxes from continuing operations was million  an effective tax rate of percent  compared with million  an effective tax rate of percent  for  and compared with a benefit of million  an effective tax rate of percent  for our elevated tax rate in was principally due to a million write off of deferred tax assets resulting from restricted stock grants that vested at share prices lower than the grant date share price and our net operating losses in the uk we maintain a percent valuation allowance against our uk based deferred tax assets 
therefore  we did not recognize a tax benefit from the uk net operating losses 

table of contents segment performance we measure financial performance by business segment 
our two reportable segments are capital markets and asset management 
we determined these segments based upon the nature of the financial products and services provided to customers and the company s management organization 
segment pre tax operating income or loss and segment pre tax operating margin are used to evaluate and measure segment performance by our management team in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance in relation to our competitors 
revenues and expenses directly associated with each respective segment are included in determining operating results 
other revenues and expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular segment are allocated based upon the company s allocation methodologies  generally based on each segment s respective net revenues  use of shared resources  headcount or other relevant measures

investment banking revenues comprise all the revenues generated through financing and advisory services activities  including derivative activities that relate to debt financing 
to assess the profitability of investment banking  we aggregate investment banking fees with the net interest income or expense associated with these activities 
investment banking revenues increased percent to million in  compared with million in  driven by increased equity financing and advisory services revenues 
in  equity financing revenues increased to million  compared with million in  resulting from an increase in us and asia equity underwriting activity and higher revenues per transaction driven by increased revenues derived from bookrun transactions

fixed income institutional brokerage revenues were million in  compared with million in the prior year 
fixed income institutional brokerage revenues were particularly robust in as we experienced a very favorable fixed income trading environment 
during  investor concerns over credit quality for municipal issuers and volatility in interest rates led to wider credit spreads and lower client activity resulting in reduced sales and trading performance

in  other income increased to million  compared with million in gains associated with our firm investments and income associated with the forfeiture of stock based compensation were offset in part by interest expense on the million of variable rate senior notes issued in december to fund a portion of the ari acquisition 
capital markets segment pre tax operating margin for was percent  which was reduced by percentage points due to restructuring charges  compared to percent for additionally  in  we experienced a shift in business with investment banking contributing a higher percentage of revenues and fixed income institutional sales and trading contributing a lower percentage 
investment banking activities generally have a higher level of compensation compared to fixed income institutional sales and trading  which drove the decline in our segment pre tax operating margin 
if this mix of business continues  we anticipate continued pressure on our capital markets segment pre tax operating margin 
investment banking revenues increased percent to million in  compared with million in driven by significant increases in equity financing revenues in all products

recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements are set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k  and are incorporated herein by reference 
critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies comply with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and conform to practices within the securities industry 
the preparation of financial statements in compliance with gaap and industry practices requires us to make estimates and assumptions that could materially affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those policies that we believe to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require us to make estimates that are difficult  subjective or complex 
most accounting policies are not considered by us to be critical accounting policies 
several factors are considered in determining whether or not a policy is critical  including whether the estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements taken as a whole  the nature of the estimates  the ability to readily validate the estimates with other information eg third party or independent sources  the sensitivity of the estimates to changes in economic conditions and whether alternative accounting methods may be used under gaap 

table of contents for a full description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following are our critical accounting policies 
valuation of financial instruments financial instruments and other inventory positions owned  financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  and certain firm investments on our consolidated statements of financial condition consist of financial instruments recorded at fair value  either as required by accounting guidance or through the fair value election 
unrealized gains and losses related to these financial instruments are reflected on our consolidated statements of operations 
the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in an orderly transaction between market participants 
the degree of judgment used in measuring fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
when available  we use observable market prices  observable market parameters  or broker or dealer prices bid and ask prices to derive the fair value of the instrument 
in the case of financial instruments transacted on recognized exchanges  the observable market prices represent quotations for completed transactions from the exchange on which the financial instrument is principally traded 
bid prices represent the highest price a buyer is willing to pay for a financial instrument at a particular time 
ask prices represent the lowest price a seller is willing to accept for a financial instrument at a particular time 
a substantial percentage of the fair value of our financial instruments and other inventory positions owned  and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  are based on observable market prices  observable market parameters  or derived from broker or dealer prices 
the availability of observable market prices and pricing parameters can vary from product to product and significant management judgment does not affect the determination of fair value 
where available  observable market prices and pricing or market parameters in a product may be used to derive a price without requiring significant judgment 
in certain markets  observable market prices or market parameters are not available for all products  and fair value is determined using techniques appropriate for each particular product 
these techniques may involve some degree of judgment 
results from valuation models and other valuation techniques in one period may not be indicative of the future period fair value measurement 
for investments in illiquid or privately held securities that do not have readily determinable fair values  the determination of fair value requires us to estimate the value of the securities using the best information available 
among the factors considered by us in determining the fair value of such financial instruments are the cost  terms and liquidity of the investment  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  the quoted market price of publicly traded securities with similar quality and yield  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
in instances where a security is subject to transfer restrictions  the value of the security is based primarily on the quoted price of a similar security without restriction but may be reduced by an amount estimated to reflect such restrictions 
even where the value of a security is derived from an independent source  certain assumptions may be required to determine the security s fair value 
for example  we assume that the size of positions that we hold would not be large enough to affect the quoted price of the securities if we sell them  and that any such sale would happen in an orderly manner 
the actual value realized upon disposition could be different from the current estimated fair value 
depending upon the product and terms of the transaction  the fair value of the company s derivative contracts can be observed or priced using models based on the net present value of estimated future cash flows 
our models generally incorporate inputs that we believe are representative of inputs other market participants would use to determine fair value of the same instruments  including contractual terms  market prices  yield curves  credit curves and measures of volatility 
the valuation models are monitored over the life of the derivative product 
if there are any changes in the underlying inputs  the model is updated for those new inputs 

table of contents fasb accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the objective of a fair value measurement is to determine the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date the exit price 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level i measurements and the lowest priority to inputs with little or no pricing observability level iii measurements 
assets and liabilities are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the following table reflects the composition of our level iii assets and level iii liabilities by asset class level iii december  december  dollars in thousands assets financial instruments and other inventory positions owned corporate securities equity securities convertible securities fixed income securities municipal securities tax exempt securities short term securities asset backed securities derivative instruments total financial instruments and other inventory positions owned investments total assets liabilities financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased corporate securities convertible securities fixed income securities asset backed securities derivative instruments total financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased investments total liabilities

we employ specific control processes to determine the reasonableness of the fair value of our financial instruments 
our processes are designed to ensure that the values received or internally estimated are accurately recorded and that the data inputs and the valuation techniques used are appropriate  consistently applied  and that the assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value 
individuals outside of the trading departments obtain independent fair values  as appropriate 
where a pricing model is used to determine fair value  recently executed comparable transactions and other observable market data are considered for purposes of validating assumptions underlying the valuation technique 
these control processes are designed to ensure that the values used for financial reporting are based on observable inputs wherever possible 
in the event that observable inputs are not available  the control processes are designed to ensure that the valuation approach utilized is appropriate and consistently applied and that the assumptions are reasonable 
goodwill and intangible assets we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill and other intangible assets  at fair value 
determining the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired requires certain management estimates 
at december   we had goodwill of million 
this goodwill balance primarily consists of million recorded in as a result of the acquisition of ari  million recorded in as a result of the acquisition of famco  and million as a result of the acquisition by us bancorp of our predecessor  piper jaffray companies inc  and its subsidiaries 
under fasb accounting standards codification topic  intangibles goodwill and other  we are required to perform impairment tests of our goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets annually and on an interim basis when certain events or circumstances exist that could indicate possible impairment 
we have elected to test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each calendar year 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process  which requires management to make judgments in determining what assumptions to use in the calculation 
the first step of the process consists of estimating the fair value of our reporting units based on the following factors our market capitalization  a discounted cash flow model using revenue and profit forecasts  public market comparables and multiples of recent mergers and acquisitions of similar businesses 
valuation multiples may be based on revenues  price to earnings and tangible capital ratios of comparable public companies and business segments 
these multiples may be adjusted to consider competitive differences including size  operating leverage and other factors 
the estimated fair values of our reporting units are compared with their carrying values  which includes the allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair values are less than the carrying values  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment by determining an implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of a reporting unit s implied fair value of goodwill requires us to allocate the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to its corresponding carrying value 

table of contents as noted above  the initial recognition of goodwill and other intangible assets and the subsequent impairment analysis requires management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates of how the acquired assets or businesses will perform in the future using valuation methods including discounted cash flow analysis 
our estimated cash flows typically extend for five years and  by their nature  are difficult to determine over an extended time period 
events and factors that may significantly affect the estimates include  among others  competitive forces and changes in revenue growth trends  cost structures  technology  discount rates and market conditions 
to assess the reasonableness of cash flow estimates and validate assumptions used in our estimates  we review historical performance of the underlying assets or similar assets 
in assessing the fair value of our reporting units  the volatile nature of the securities markets and our industry requires us to consider the business and market cycle and assess the stage of the cycle in estimating the timing and extent of future cash flows 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of november   and no impairment was identified 
we also tested the intangible assets indefinite and definite life acquired as part of the famco and ari acquisitions and concluded there was no impairment 
stock based compensation as part of our compensation to employees and directors  we use stock based compensation  consisting of restricted stock and stock options 
the company accounts for equity awards in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  compensation stock compensation  asc  which requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at grant date fair value over the service period of the award  net of estimated forfeitures 
we grant shares of restricted stock to current employees as part of year end compensation annual grants and as a retention tool  and to new employees as sign on awards 
we have also granted restricted stock awards with service conditions to key employees retention grants  as well as restricted stock awards with performance conditions to certain executive leaders performance grants 
annual grants are made each february for the prior fiscal year performance and constitute a portion of an employee s annual incentive for the prior year 
we recognize the compensation expense prior to the grant date of the award as we determined that the service inception date precedes the grant date 
these grants are not subject to service requirements that employees must fulfill in exchange for the right to these awards  as the grants continue to vest after termination of employment  so long as the employee does not violate certain post termination restrictions as set forth in the award agreements or any agreements entered into upon termination 
the annual grants have a three year cliff vesting period  which is the period over which post termination restrictions apply 
these post termination restrictions do not meet the criteria for an in substance service condition as defined by asc accordingly  such shares of restricted stock comprising annual grants are expensed in the period to which those awards are deemed to be earned  which is the calendar year preceding the february grant date 
if any of these awards are forfeited  the lower of the fair value at grant date or the fair value at the date of forfeiture is recorded within the consolidated statements of operations as other income 
sign on equity awards are issued to current employees as a retention tool and used as a recruiting tool for new employees 
the majority of sign on awards have three year cliff vesting terms and employees must fulfill service requirements in exchange for the right to the awards 
compensation expense is amortized on a straight line basis from the date of grant over the requisite service period 
employees forfeit unvested shares upon termination of employment and a reversal of the related compensation expense is recorded 
retention grants are subject to ratable vesting based upon a five year service requirement and are amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis from the grant date over the requisite service period 
employees forfeit unvested retention shares upon termination of employment and a reversal of compensation expense is recorded 
performance based restricted stock awards granted in and vest upon achievement of a specific performance based metric prior to may performance grants are amortized on a straight line basis over the period we expect the performance target to be met 
the performance condition must be met for the awards to vest and total compensation cost will be recognized only if the performance condition is satisfied 
the probability that the performance conditions will be achieved and that the awards will vest is reevaluated each reporting period with 
table of contents changes in actual or estimated outcomes accounted for using a cumulative effect adjustment to compensation expense 
stock based compensation granted to our non employee directors is in the form of unrestricted common shares of piper jaffray companies stock 
the stock based compensation paid to directors is immediately expensed and is included in our results of operations as outside services expense as of the date of grant 
we granted stock options in fiscal years through the options were expensed on a straight line basis over the required service period  based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date using a black scholes option pricing model 
this model required management to exercise judgment with respect to certain assumptions  including the expected dividend yield  the expected volatility  and the expected life of the options 
as described above pertaining to our annual grants of restricted shares  stock options granted to employees were expensed in the calendar year preceding the annual february grant 
contingencies we are involved in various pending and potential legal proceedings related to our business  including litigation  arbitration and regulatory proceedings 
some of these matters involve claims for substantial amounts  including claims for punitive and other special damages 
we have  after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  contingencies  to the extent that claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the determination of these reserve amounts requires significant judgment on the part of management 
in making these determinations  we consider many factors  including  but not limited to  the loss and damages sought by the plaintiff or claimant  the basis and validity of the claim  the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim  and the potential for  and magnitude of  damages or settlements from such pending and potential litigation and arbitration proceedings  and fines and penalties or orders from regulatory agencies 
given the uncertainties regarding timing  size  volume and outcome of pending and potential legal proceedings and other factors  the amounts of reserves are difficult to determine and of necessity subject to future revision 
subject to the foregoing  we believe  based on our current knowledge  after appropriate consultation with outside legal counsel and after taking into account our established reserves  that pending litigation  arbitration and regulatory proceedings will be resolved with no material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  if  during any period  a potential adverse contingency should become probable or resolved for an amount in excess of the established reserves  the results of operations in that period could be materially adversely affected 
income taxes we file a consolidated us federal income tax return  which includes all of our qualifying subsidiaries 
we also are subject to income tax in various states and municipalities and those foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
amounts provided for income taxes are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for tax loss carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences in reporting certain items  principally  amortization of share based compensation 
the realization of deferred tax assets is assessed and a valuation allowance is recorded to the extent that it is more likely than not that any portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we believe that our future taxable profits will be sufficient to recognize our us and asia subsidiary deferred tax assets 
if however  our projections of future taxable profits do not materialize  we may conclude that a valuation allowance is necessary  which would impact our results of operations in that period 
we have recorded a deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million related to uk subsidiary net operating loss carry forwards 

table of contents we record deferred tax benefits for future tax deductions expected upon the vesting of share based compensation 
if deductions reported on our tax return for share based compensation ie  the value of the share based compensation at the time of vesting exceed the cumulative cost of those instruments recognized for financial reporting ie  the grant date fair value of the compensation computed in accordance with asc  we record the excess tax benefit as additional paid in capital 
conversely  if deductions reported on our tax return for share based compensation are less than the cumulative cost of those instruments recognized for financial reporting  we offset the deficiency first to any previously recognized excess tax benefits recorded as additional paid in capital and any remaining deficiency is recorded as income tax expense 
as of december   we did not have any available excess tax benefits within additional paid in capital 
approximately  shares of restricted stock vested in at values less than the grant date fair value resulting in million of income tax expense in approximately  shares vested in february at values greater than the grant date fair value resulting in million of excess tax benefits recorded as additional paid in capital in the first quarter in we establish reserves for uncertain income tax positions in accordance with fasb accounting standards codification topic  income taxes when  it is not more likely than not that a certain position or component of a position will be ultimately upheld by the relevant taxing authorities 
significant judgment is required in evaluating uncertain tax positions 
our tax provision and related accruals include the impact of estimates for uncertain tax positions and changes to the reserves that are considered appropriate 
to the extent the probable tax outcome of these matters changes  such change in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period of change and  in turn  our results of operations 
liquidity  funding and capital resources liquidity is of critical importance to us given the nature of our business 
insufficient liquidity resulting from adverse circumstances contributes to  and may be the cause of  financial institution failure 
accordingly  we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including our cash and net capital positions  and we have implemented a liquidity strategy designed to enable our business to continue to operate even under adverse circumstances  although there can be no assurance that our strategy will be successful under all circumstances 
the majority of our tangible assets consist of assets readily convertible into cash 
financial instruments and other inventory positions owned are stated at fair value and are generally readily marketable in most market conditions 
receivables and payables with customers and brokers and dealers usually settle within a few days 
as part of our liquidity strategy  we emphasize diversification of funding sources to the extent possible and maximize our lower cost financing alternatives 
our assets are financed by our cash flows from operations  equity capital  and other funding arrangements 
the fluctuations in cash flows from financing activities are directly related to daily operating activities from our various businesses 
the following are financial instruments that are cash and cash equivalents  or are deemed by management to be generally readily convertible into cash  marginable or accessible for liquidity purposes within a relatively short period of time december  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents cash in banks money market investments total cash and cash equivalents cash and securities segregated consists of deposits in accordance with rule c of the securities exchange act of  which subjects piper jaffray co  our us broker dealer subsidiary carrying client accounts  to requirements related to maintaining cash or qualified securities in a segregated reserve account for the exclusive benefit of our clients 

table of contents use of financial instruments for liquidity purposes by our regulated entities is limited by net capital requirements or would curtail many of our revenue producing activities if it reduced our net capital 
certain market conditions can impact the liquidity of our inventory positions  requiring us to hold larger inventory positions for longer than expected or requiring us to take other actions that may adversely impact our results 
a significant component of our employees compensation is paid in annual discretionary incentive compensation 
the timing of these incentive compensation payments  which generally are made in february  has a significant impact on our cash position and liquidity 
we currently do not pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not plan to in the foreseeable future 
additionally  we recently entered into a bank syndicated credit agreement  as described in note to our consolidated financial statements  and it includes a restrictive covenant that restricts our ability to pay cash dividends 
in  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million in shares of our common stock through june  in the first half of  we repurchased  shares or million of our common stock under this authorization 
in aggregate  we repurchased million in shares of our common stock under this million authorization 
our board of directors approved a new repurchase authorization on july   of up to million in shares of our common stock 
under this new authorization  we repurchased  shares or million of our common stock during the third and fourth quarters of this new authorization expires on september  cash flows cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  from december  operating activities used million of cash due to an increase in operating assets  particularly our net financial instruments and other inventory positions owned 
during  market conditions improved and as a result  we increased certain securities inventory balances to take advantage of opportunities in the market and to serve our clients 
investing activities in used million of cash  the majority of which related to our acquisition of ari 
cash of million was provided through financing activities  primarily an increase in repurchase agreements and issuance of commercial paper  offset in part by million utilized to repurchase common stock 
cash from financing activities was used to fund our acquisition of ari and increased levels of securities inventory 
additionally  we entered into a bank syndicated credit agreement in late  which provided million in financing that was used to repay the million in variable rate senior notes that were due on december  cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from december  operating activities used million of cash due primarily to an increase in operating assets  particularly our net financial instruments and other inventory positions owned 
in  we significantly decreased our inventory positions owned to reduce our market exposure 
in late  as the market environment improved  we began to bring our inventory to more normalized levels 
investing activities used million of cash for the purchase of fixed assets 
cash of million was provided through financing activities due in part to the issuance of variable rate senior notes in the amount of million and commercial paper in the amount of million during the additional cash provided by the issuance of variable rate senior notes and commercial paper reduced the need to enter into repurchase agreements at december   resulting in an million decrease in cash inflows related to repurchase agreements 
additionally  million was utilized to repurchase common stock 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from december  operating activities provided cash of million due to cash received from a reduction in net financial instruments and other inventory positions owned as we reduced our inventory positions during to reduce our market exposure 
partially offsetting this fluctuation was our net operating loss 
investing activities used million of cash for the payment to the former owners of famco in accordance with performance conditions set forth in the purchase agreement and the purchase of fixed assets 
cash of million was used in financing 
table of contents activities due in part to a million decrease in secured financing activities and million utilized to repurchase common stock 
funding sources short term financing our day to day funding and liquidity is obtained primarily through the use of repurchase agreements  commercial paper issuance  and bank lines of credit  and is typically collateralized by our securities inventory 
these funding sources are critical to our ability to finance and hold inventory  which is a necessary part of our institutional brokerage business 
the majority of our inventory is very liquid and is therefore funded by overnight facilities 
however  we have established and structured certain funding sources with longer maturities ie  our committed line and commercial paper to mitigate changes in the liquidity of our inventory based on changing market conditions 
our funding sources are also dependant on the types of inventory counterparties are willing to accept as collateral and the number of counterparties available 
we currently have a limited number of counterparties that will enter into municipal repurchase agreements 
the majority of our bank lines will accept municipal inventory which helps mitigate this municipal repurchase counterparty risk 
we also have established arrangements to obtain financing by another broker dealer at the end of each business day related specifically to our convertible inventory 
funding is generally obtained at rates based upon the federal funds rate and or the london interbank offer rate 
uncommitted lines we use uncommitted lines in the ordinary course of business to fund a portion of our daily operations  and the amount borrowed under our uncommitted lines varies daily based on our funding needs 
our uncommitted secured lines total million with three banks and are dependent on having appropriate collateral  as determined by the bank agreement  to secure an advance under the line 
collateral limitations could reduce the amount of funding available under these secured lines 
we also have a million uncommitted unsecured facility with one of these banks 
these uncommitted lines are discretionary and are not a commitment by the bank to provide an advance under the line 
these lines are subject to approval by the respective bank each time an advance is requested and advances may be denied 
we manage our relationships with the banks that provide these uncommitted facilities in order to have appropriate levels of funding for our business 
at december   we had no advances against these lines of credit 
committed lines our committed line is a million revolving secured credit facility 
we use this credit facility in the ordinary course of business to fund a portion of our daily operations  and the amount borrowed under the facility varies daily based on our funding needs 
advances under this facility are secured by certain marketable securities 
the facility includes a covenant that requires piper jaffray co  our us broker dealer subsidiary  to maintain a minimum net capital of million  and the unpaid principal amount of all advances under the facility will be due on december  at december   we had million in advances against our committed line of credit 
commercial paper program in  we initiated a secured commercial paper program to fund a portion of our securities inventories 
the maximum amount that may be issued under the program is million  of which million was outstanding at december  the commercial paper notes are secured by our securities inventory with maturities on the commercial paper ranging from days to days from date of issuance

the average funding balance in the third quarter of declined to million  compared with million during the second quarter of  due to a decline in average inventory balances 
the average funding balance for the fourth quarter of was million  compared with million in the third quarter of  driven by increased inventories  specifically municipal bonds 
three year bank syndicated credit agreement on december   we entered into a three year bank syndicated credit agreement credit agreement  comprised of a million amortizing term loan and a million revolving credit facility 
suntrust bank is the administrative agent agent for the lenders 
the term loan amortizes in year one  in year two and in year three 
as of december   million had been drawn on the revolving credit facility 
the credit agreement includes customary events of default  including failure to pay principal when due or failure to pay interest within three business days of when due  failure to comply with the covenants in the credit agreement and related documents  failure to pay or another event of default under other material indebtedness in an amount exceeding million  bankruptcy or insolvency of the company or any of our subsidiaries  a change in control of the company or a failure of piper jaffray co 
to extend  renew or refinance our existing million committed revolving secured credit facility on substantially the same terms as the existing committed facility 
if there is any event of default under the credit agreement  the agent may declare the entire principal and any accrued interest on the loans under the credit agreement to be due and payable and exercise other customary remedies 
the credit agreement includes covenants that  among other things  limit our leverage ratio  require maintenance of certain levels of cash and regulatory net capital  require our asset management segment to achieve minimum earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and impose certain limitations on our ability to make acquisitions and make payments on our capital stock 
with respect to the net capital covenant  our 
table of contents us broker dealer subsidiary is required to maintain minimum net capital of million 
at december   we were in compliance with all covenants 
variable rate senior notes on december   we issued variable rate senior notes notes in the amount of million 
the initial holders of the notes were entities advised by pacific investment management company llc pimco 
the unpaid principal and interest amount of the notes were paid off in full on december  from the proceeds of the credit agreement 
contractual obligations in the normal course of business  we enter into various contractual obligations that may require future cash payments 
the following table summarizes the contractual amounts at december   in total and by remaining maturity 
excluded from the table are a number of obligations recorded in the consolidated statements of financial condition that generally are short term in nature  including secured financing transactions  trading liabilities  short term borrowings and other payables and accrued liabilities

b we commit to merchant banking financing for our clients or make commitments to underwrite debt 
we are unable to estimate the timing on the funding of these commitments 
c the acquisition of famco included the potential for additional cash consideration to be paid in the form of three annual payments related to  and contingent upon revenue exceeding certain revenue run rate thresholds 
the amount of the three annual payments assuming the revenue run rate threshold has been met will be equal to a percentage of earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization for the previous year 
we made payments of additional cash consideration of million in  million related to  and million related to additionally  we have accrued million for a final true up payment anticipated to be made related to purchase commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase commitments with variable pricing provisions are included in the table based on the minimum contractual amounts 
certain purchase commitments contain termination or renewal provisions 
the table reflects the minimum contractual amounts likely to be paid under these agreements assuming the contracts are not terminated 
the amounts presented in the table above may not necessarily reflect our actual future cash funding requirements  because the actual timing of the future payments made may vary from the stated contractual obligation 
in addition  due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits as of december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authority 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligation table above 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of income taxes 

table of contents capital requirements as a registered broker dealer and member firm of finra  our us broker dealer subsidiary is subject to the uniform net capital rule of the sec and the net capital rule of finra 
we have elected to use the alternative method permitted by the uniform net capital rule  which requires that we maintain minimum net capital of the greater of million or percent of aggregate debit balances arising from customer transactions  as this is defined in the rule 
finra may prohibit a member firm from expanding its business or paying dividends if resulting net capital would be less than percent of aggregate debit balances 
advances to affiliates  repayment of subordinated liabilities  dividend payments and other equity withdrawals are subject to certain notification and other provisions of the uniform net capital rules 
we expect that these provisions will not impact our ability to meet current and future obligations 
we also are subject to certain notification requirements related to withdrawals of excess net capital from our broker dealer subsidiary 
at december   our net capital under the sec s uniform net capital rule was million  and exceeded the minimum net capital required under the sec rule by million 
although we operate with a level of net capital substantially greater than the minimum thresholds established by finra and the sec  a substantial reduction of our capital would curtail many of our revenue producing activities 
piper jaffray ltd  our broker dealer subsidiary registered in the united kingdom  is subject to the capital requirements of the uk financial services authority 
each of our piper jaffray asia entities licensed by the hong kong securities and futures commission is subject to the liquid capital requirements of the securities and futures financial resources rule promulgated under the securities and futures ordinance 
off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business we enter into various types of off balance sheet arrangements 
the following table summarizes our off balance sheet arrangements at december  and total expiration per period at december  contractual amount december  later dollars in thousands customer matched book derivative contracts trading securities derivative contracts credit default swap index contracts foreign currency forward contracts loan commitments private equity and other principal investments consists of interest rate swaps 
we have minimal market risk related to these matched book derivative contracts  however  we do have counterparty risk with two major financial institutions  which is mitigated by collateral deposits 
in addition  we have a limited number of counterparties contractual amount of million at december  who are not required to post collateral 
based on market movements  the uncollateralized amounts representing the fair value of the derivative contracts could become material  exposing us to the credit risk of these counterparties 
at december   we had million of credit exposure with these counterparties  including million of credit exposure with one counterparty 
we believe the fair value of these derivative contracts is a more relevant measure of the obligations because we believe the notional or contract amount overstates the expected payout 
at december  and  the net fair value of these derivative contracts approximated million and million  respectively 

table of contents derivatives derivatives notional contract amounts are not reflected as assets or liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial condition 
rather  the market value  or fair value  of the derivative transactions are reported on the consolidated statements of financial condition as assets or liabilities in financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  as applicable 
derivatives are presented on a net basis by counterparty when a legal right of offset exists and on a net basis by cross product when applicable provisions are stated in a master netting agreement 
we enter into derivative contracts in a principal capacity as a dealer to satisfy the financial needs of clients 
we also use derivative products to hedge the interest rate and market value risks associated with our security positions 
our interest rate hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating interest rate risk 
for a complete discussion of our activities related to derivative products  see note  financial instruments and other inventory positions owned and financial instruments and other inventory positions sold  but not yet purchased  in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
loan commitments we may commit to merchant banking financing for our clients or make commitments to underwrite corporate debt 
we had no loan commitments outstanding at december  private equity and other principal investments as of december   we have investments in various entities  typically partnerships or limited liability companies  established for the purpose of investing in equity and debt securities of public and private companies 
we commit capital or act as the managing partner of these entities 
some of these entities are deemed to be variable interest entities

enterprise risk management risk is an inherent part of our business 
in the course of conducting business operations  we are exposed to a variety of risks 
market risk  liquidity risk  credit risk  operational risk  legal  regulatory and compliance risk  and reputational risk are the principal risks we face in operating our business 
we seek to identify  assess and monitor each risk in accordance with defined policies and procedures 
the extent to which we properly identify and effectively manage each of these risks is critical to our financial condition and profitability 
with respect to market risk and credit risk  the cornerstone of our risk management process is daily communication among traders  trading department management and senior management concerning our inventory positions and overall risk profile 
our risk management functions supplement this communication process by providing their independent perspectives on our market and credit risk profile on a daily basis 
the broader goals of our risk management functions are to understand the risk profile of each trading area  to consolidate risk monitoring company wide  to assist in implementing effective hedging strategies  to articulate large trading or position risks to senior management  and to ensure accurate mark to market pricing 
in addition to supporting daily risk management processes on the trading desks  our risk management functions support our financial risk committee 
this committee oversees risk management practices  including defining acceptable risk tolerances and approving risk management policies 

table of contents risk management techniques  processes and strategies may not be fully effective in mitigating our risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk  and any risk management failures could expose us to material unanticipated losses 
market risk market risk represents the risk of financial volatility that may result from the change in value of a financial instrument due to fluctuations in its market price 
our exposure to market risk is directly related to our role as a financial intermediary for our clients  to our market making activities and our proprietary activities 
market risks are inherent to both cash and derivative financial instruments 
the scope of our market risk management policies and procedures includes all market sensitive financial instruments 
our different types of market risk include interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the potential volatility from changes in market interest rates 
we are exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates  changes in the shape of the yield curve  changes in credit spreads  and the rate of prepayments 
interest rate risk is managed through the use of appropriate hedging in us government securities  agency securities  mortgage backed securities  corporate debt securities  interest rate swaps  options  futures and forward contracts 
we utilize interest rate swap contracts to hedge a portion of our fixed income inventory and to hedge rate lock agreements and forward bond purchase agreements we may enter into with our public finance customers 
additionally  we historically used interest rate swap agreements to hedge residual cash flows from our tender option bond program 
our interest rate hedging strategies may not work in all market environments and as a result may not be effective in mitigating interest rate risk 
these interest rate swap contracts are recorded at fair value with the changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
equity price risk equity price risk represents the potential loss in value due to adverse changes in the level or volatility of equity prices 
we are exposed to equity price risk through our trading activities in the us market on both listed and over the counter equity markets 
we attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our market making and in our inventory of equity securities by establishing limits on the notional level of our inventory and by managing net position levels within those limits 
currency risk currency risk arises from the possibility that fluctuations in foreign exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
a portion of our business is conducted in currencies other than the us dollar  and changes in foreign exchange rates relative to the us dollar can therefore affect the value of non us dollar net assets  revenues and expenses 
a change in the foreign currency rates could create either a foreign currency transaction gain loss recorded in our consolidated statements of operations or a foreign currency translation adjustment to the stockholders equity section of our consolidated statements of financial condition 
value at risk value at risk var is the potential loss in value of our trading positions due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon with a specified confidence level 
we perform a daily var analysis on substantially all of our trading positions  including fixed income  equities  convertible bonds  exchange traded options  and all associated economic hedges 
these positions encompass both customer related activities and proprietary investments 
we use a var model because it provides a common metric for assessing market risk across business lines and products 
changes in var between reporting periods are generally due to changes in levels of risk exposure  volatilities and or correlations among asset classes and individual securities 
we use a monte carlo simulation methodology for var calculations 
we believe this methodology provides var results that properly reflect the risk profile of all our instruments  including those that contain optionality  and also accurately models correlation movements among all of our asset classes 
in addition  it provides improved tail results as there are no assumptions of distribution  and can provide additional insight for scenario shock analysis 
model based var derived from simulation has inherent limitations including reliance on historical data to predict future market risk  var calculated using a one day time horizon does not fully capture the market risk of 
table of contents positions that cannot be liquidated or offset with hedges within one day  and published var results reflect past trading positions while future risk depends on future positions 
the modeling of the market risk characteristics of our trading positions involves a number of assumptions and approximations 
while we believe that these assumptions and approximations are reasonable  different assumptions and approximations could produce materially different var estimates 
the following table quantifies the model based var simulated for each component of market risk for the periods presented computed using the past days of historical data 
when calculating var we use a percent confidence level and a one day time horizon 
this means that  over time  there is a in chance that daily trading net revenues will fall below the expected daily trading net revenues by an amount at least as large as the reported var 
shortfalls on a single day can exceed reported var by significant amounts 
shortfalls can also accumulate over a longer time horizon  such as a number of consecutive trading days 
therefore  there can be no assurance that actual losses occurring on any given day arising from changes in market conditions will not exceed the var amounts shown below or that such losses will not occur more than once in a day trading period 
at december  dollars in thousands interest rate risk equity price risk diversification effect total value at risk equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the two risk categories 
this effect arises because the two market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
we view average var over a period of time as more representative of trends in the business than var at any single point in time 
the table below illustrates the daily high  low and average value at risk calculated for each component of market risk during the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december  dollars in thousands high low average interest rate risk equity price risk diversification effect total value at risk for the year ended december  dollars in thousands high low average interest rate risk equity price risk diversification effect total value at risk equals the difference between total var and the sum of the vars for the two risk categories 
this effect arises because the two market risk categories are not perfectly correlated 
because high and low var numbers for these risk categories may have occurred on different days  high and low numbers for diversification benefit would not be meaningful 
trading losses incurred on a single day exceeded our one day var on occasions during 
table of contents the aggregate var as of december  was lower compared to levels reported as of december  although end of year inventory levels are slightly higher from those reported for the previous year  current inventories are made up of lower var assets 
in addition to var  we also employ additional measures to monitor and manage market risk exposure including the following net market position  duration exposure  option sensitivities  and inventory turnover 
all metrics are aggregated by asset concentration and are used for monitoring limits and exception approvals 
liquidity risk market risk can be exacerbated in times of trading illiquidity when market participants refrain from transacting in normal quantities and or at normal bid offer spreads 
depending on the specific security  the structure of the financial product  and or overall market conditions  we may be forced to hold a security for substantially longer than we had planned 
our inventory positions subject us to potential financial losses from the reduction in value of illiquid positions 
we are also exposed to liquidity risk in our day to day funding activities 
we have a relatively low leverage ratio of as of december  we calculate our leverage ratio by dividing total assets by total shareholders equity 
we manage liquidity risk by diversifying our funding sources across products and among individual counterparties within those products 
for example  our treasury department actively manages the use of a committed bank line  repurchase agreements  securities lending arrangements  commercial paper issuance and secured and unsecured bank borrowings each day depending on pricing  availability of funding  available collateral and lending parameters from any one of these sources 
in addition to managing our capital and funding  the treasury department oversees the management of net interest income risk and the overall use of our capital  funding  and balance sheet 
we currently act as the remarketing agent for approximately billion of variable rate demand notes  all of which have a financial institution providing a liquidity guarantee 
at certain times  demand from buyers of variable rate demand notes is less than the supply generated by sellers of these instruments
