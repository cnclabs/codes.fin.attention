item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global provider of commercial high resolution earth imagery products and services 
our products and services support a wide variety of uses  including defense  intelligence and homeland security applications  mapping and analysis  environmental monitoring  oil and gas exploration  and infrastructure management 
our principal customers include us and foreign defense and intelligence agencies and a wide variety of commercial customers  such as internet portals  companies in the energy  telecommunications  utility and agricultural industries  and us and foreign civil government agencies 
the imagery that forms the foundation of our products and services is collected daily via our three high resolution imagery satellites and managed in our content archive  which we refer to as our imagelibrary 
we believe our imagelibrary is the largest  most up to date and comprehensive archive of high resolution earth imagery commercially available  containing more than billion square kilometers of imagery  with new imagery added every day 
with the addition of our worldview satellite  which achieved full operational capacity foc on january   our collection capacity has expanded to approximately million square kilometers per year 
products and services we offer earth imagery products and services that are comprised of imagery from our three satellite constellation  and aerial imagery that we acquire from third party suppliers 
we process our imagery to varying levels according to the customer s specifications and deliver our products using the distribution method that best suits our customers needs 
customers can purchase satellite or aerial images that are archived in our imagelibrary 
customers can also order imagery content by placing custom orders  which require tasking of our satellites  for a specific area of interest  or as a bundle of imagery and data for a region or type of location  such as cities  ports and harbors or airports 
for example citysphere  an imagelibrary product  features color imagery for of the world s largest cities that is refreshed on a routine basis 
customers specify how they want the imagery content that they are purchasing from us to be produced 
we deliver our satellite imagery content at three processing levels i basic imagery with the least amount of processing  ii standard imagery with radiometric and geometric correction  and iii ortho rectified imagery with radiometric  geometric  and topographic correction 
radiometric correction enables images to appear uniformly illuminated with the right level of brightness 
geometric correction allows a user to identify the latitudinal  longitudinal and altitudinal location of any point in an image 
topographic correction accounts for terrain and projects images onto the earth as they would be seen by the human eye 
all of our aerial imagery is delivered as ortho rectified imagery

table of contents we also use enhanced processing to produce mosaic and stereo imagery products 
the mosaic process takes multiple imagery scenes  collected at different times and dates  and merges them into a single seamless imagery product 
we use specialized collection and enhanced processing to produce stereo imagery products 
stereo imagery products consist of two images collected from two different viewpoints along the satellite orbit track that are produced as basic products  but can be viewed in stereo d using specialized software 
stereo imagery products are used for the creation of digital elevation maps  for the more accurate creation of d maps and flight simulations 
we offer a range of on and off line distribution options designed to enable customers to easily access and integrate our imagery into their business operations and applications  including desktop software applications  web services that provide for direct on line access to our imagelibrary  file transfer protocol ftp  and physical media such as cd  dvd  and hard drive 
we offer an additional distribution option through our dap that allows certain customers  approved by the us government  to task and download data directly from our worldview and worldview satellites within their regional area of interest 
dap is designed to meet the enhanced information and operational security needs of a select and limited number of defense and intelligence customers and certain commercial customers 
to date we have signed four customer contracts for our dap 
we sell our products and services through a combination of direct and indirect channels  a global network of resellers  strategic partners  direct enterprise sales and web services 
significant customer in september  we entered into the nextview agreement with the national geospatial intelligence agency nga under which we agreed to provide a minimum of million of imagery products and services from our worldview satellite 
of this amount  million was received between september and november  the date worldview became operational  and was used to offset the construction costs of the satellite 
the remaining million commitment was to be received upon the delivery of imagery once worldview achieved full operational capability foc 
in january  we amended the nextview agreement from image based ordering to a service level agreement sla and increased the amount we received under the nextview agreement from million to million nextview sla 
on june   the nextview sla agreement was further amended to extend the term from july  through march  in consideration for payment of an additional million  payable at million per month during the extended term 
on february  the nextview agreement was amended to provide nga with an option to extend the agreement for three months on the same terms from april  to june  and six additional options each for a one month period with the last option term expiring on december  on march   nga exercised the option to extend through june  on june   nga exercised its first monthly option to extend through july   and on july  exercised its second monthly option to extend through august  the nextview sla expired august  on august   we entered into the enhancedview contract with nga 
the sla portion of the enhancedview contract  enhancedview sla has an effective date of september   commencing upon the expiration of the nextview sla 
the enhancedview contract has a ten year term  inclusive of nine one year options exercisable by nga  and is subject to congressional appropriations and the federal budget process  and the right of nga to terminate or suspend the contract at any time 
the enhancedview sla portion of the award is sized at billion over the term of the contract assuming nga exercises all of its options and we perform as specified  million annually  or million per month  for the first four contract years  commencing september   with an increase to million annually  or million per month  for the remaining six years of the contract term 
the award also provides for up to million for value added products  infrastructure enhancements and other services  including the option for nga to require us to lower the altitude of worldview to an altitude of km at any time after september  digitalglobe will be required to meet certain service level requirements related to the operational performance of the satellites comprising the worldview constellation and related ground systems 
to support requirements under this agreement  we have begun the procurement and construction of our next satellite  worldview as well as certain other infrastructure improvements 
we recognize revenue for the billion in services to be provided under the enhancedview sla using a proportional performance method based upon the estimated capacity of our constellation made available to nga compared to the total capacity to be provided over the life of the contract 
the contract requires the company to increase capacity of the constellation through the installation of additional remote ground terminals  which communicate directly with our satellites  as well as the addition of an entirely new satellite  worldview our worldview satellite is expected to be ready for launch in the second half of as capacity is added to our constellation  we recognize revenue in direct proportion to the amount of incremental capacity that is made available to nga 
commencing in september  we recognized approximately million of revenue monthly through december   under the enhancedview sla 
given the significant amount of constellation capacity expected to be generated by worldview satellite and the increasing percentage of capacity that nga will acquire from us once worldview satellite becomes operational  we anticipate a material increase in revenue once worldview satellite reaches foc

table of contents under the enhancedview sla  and assuming all option years under the agreement are exercised and funded  we will receive a consistent  monthly non refundable cash payment of approximately million from nga during the first four years of the enhancedview contract  with an increase to million per month in years five though ten 
each month is subject to a holdback  up to of the monthly payment scheduled  depending upon the company s performance against pre defined criteria 
if we have been certified as having performed all requirements in the agreement each month  no holdback will be applied to that month 
if funds are held back  the company retains the cash  however  those funds can be applied to future products and services or will fund a pro rated extension beyond the current contract period 
accordingly  all amounts held back will cause the company to defer recognition of a corresponding revenue amount until such additional products or services have been provided 
from september  to december   we satisfied all performance criteria under the agreement  and therefore had no holdback applied for the period 
revenue our principal source of revenue is the licensing of our earth imagery products and services to end users and resellers 
we conduct our business through two segments i defense and intelligence and ii commercial 
we have organized our business into these two segments because we believe that customers in these two groups are functionally similar in terms of their areas of focus and purchasing habits 
our imagery products and services are comprised of imagery that we process to varying levels according to the customer s specifications 
we deliver our products and services using the distribution method that best suits our customers needs 
customers can purchase satellite or aerial images that are archived in our imagelibrary 
customers can also order imagery content by placing custom orders  which require tasking of our satellites  for a specific area of interest  or as a bundle of imagery and data for a region or type of location  such as cities  ports and harbors or airports

table of contents defense and intelligence revenue our defense and intelligence segment consists of customers who are principally defense and intelligence agencies of us or foreign governments 
the us government  through nga  purchases our imagery products and services on behalf of various entities within the us government  including the military commands and other government agencies 
we also sell to other us defense and intelligence customers including defense and intelligence contractors who provide an additional outlet for our imagery by providing value added services to our imagery to deliver a final end product to a customer 
our defense and intelligence customers focus on image quality  including resolution  frequency of area revisit and coverage  as well as ensuring availability of a certain amount of our capacity as they integrate our products and services into their operational planning 
our customers in this segment typically operate under contracts with purchase commitments  through which we receive monthly or quarterly payments in exchange for delivering specific orders to the customer 
our revenue from our defense and intelligence customers has historically been largely from tasking orders  with a smaller portion from sales of imagery from our imagelibrary 
we believe this trend will continue 
we sell to our defense and intelligence customers both directly and through resellers 
by the second half of  we commissioned all four of our dap customers ground terminals and began generating revenue from providing satellite access time to these customers 
only one dap customer had been commissioned in we earn revenue based on facility and maintenance amortization and access minute fees 
we do not recognize revenue from a dap customer until we commission into operation the ground terminal and can provide contractually specified access to our operational satellites 
the costs associated with the dap s are deferred until the commencement of operations  and are being amortized to cost of revenue associated with the dap 
we amortize the cost of each facility ratably over the customer relationship period assumed to be the life of the worldview satellite  or currently through the first quarter of

commercial business also includes customers that add our content to enhance and expand the information products and services that they develop and sell to the commercial market 
we call this second type of customer an integrated information customer 
the company has defined americas to include north america  south america and central america and international revenue to include all revenue outside of the americas 
most of our traditional commercial customers purchase our imagery products and services on an as needed basis  either from the imagelibrary or by placing tasking orders 
by contrast  some of our integrated information customers prefer contracts to maintain access to our imagery archive  or purchase subscriptions to access our imagelibrary 
our commercial customers are located throughout the world 
we sell to these customers both directly and through resellers

table of contents for the twelve months ended december   we generated approximately of our commercial revenue from paid tasking and from our imagelibrary 
for the year ended december  and  our top five commercial customers accounted for and of our commercial revenue 
we believe that we will have additional growth opportunities internationally especially in countries with rapidly developing economies  such as brazil  china  india and russia  and  as a result  we expect that long term sales growth in our commercial segment will be higher outside of the united states 
year ended december  commercial revenue americas international total commercial revenue revenue as a percent of total americas revenue international revenue reseller and direct sales direct sales resellers expenses most of our revenue is generated by the sale of products and services comprised of imagery from our quickbird  worldview and worldview satellites 
given that most of the operating costs of a satellite are related to the pre operation capital expenditures required to build and launch a satellite  there is no significant direct relationship between our cost of revenue and changes in our revenue 
our cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of personnel  as well as the cost of operations directly associated with operating our satellites  retrieving information from the satellites  and processing the data retrieved 
costs of acquiring aerial imagery from third parties are capitalized and amortized on an accelerated basis as a cost of revenue 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of labor  benefits  travel  rent  insurance  utilities and related overhead costs  third party consultant payments  sales commissions and marketing expenses 
our total selling  general and administrative expenses have been increasing in recent years  and we expect the increase in costs to continue  as we expand our sales and administrative resources to enable our revenue growth and increase capacity for product sales and distribution 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses may be offset in future years by the capitalization of labor costs incurred in the development of new assets  especially during the construction of a new satellite 
with the initiation of worldview satellite and other capital investments related to the enhancedview program  we anticipate we will be capitalizing increasing amounts of direct labor costs that are associated with the development of these programs 
depreciation and amortization consist primarily of depreciation of our satellites and other operating assets 
on january   when the worldview satellite reached foc  we began depreciating this asset at a rate of approximately million each quarter 
our interest charges consist primarily of interest payments on borrowings used to finance satellite construction and are capitalized as a cost of our satellite construction 
during  all interest incurred was capitalized to our worldview satellite and other assets under construction 
with the successful commissioning of worldview  the total capitalized interest amount was significantly smaller in  increasing our interest expense 
based on our capitalization policies  we expect our future interest expense to decrease due to capitalization of these costs to the construction of our worldview satellite and other infrastructure 
the costs of our satellites include capitalized interest costs incurred during the construction and development period of the satellite 
in addition  capitalized costs of our satellites and related ground systems include internal direct labor costs incurred in their construction

the million increase in cost of revenue is primarily attributable to million of amortization of deferred contract costs arising from the construction of the dap facilities and the costs associated with maintenance and a million increase in subcontracting costs 
the cost of revenue increase also includes a million increase in labor related costs  primarily driven by headcount growth as well as the cost of employee labor which had previously been capitalized as part of the worldview development  but which has now been reallocated to other operating functions within the company 
these increases were offset by a million decrease in amortization of the purchased aerial imagery library

we invested in our people and infrastructure  leading to an increase in both cost of revenue and selling  general and administrative costs in absolute terms and as a percent of our total revenue 
increases in cost of revenue were realized due to increases in production  satellite operations and information technology costs

cost of revenue grew as a percentage of revenue in the million increase in selling  general and administrative costs was attributable to million in labor  travel and related benefit costs  million increase in stock compensation as a result of a grant given at the time of the ipo and stock option grants for new board members  million sales commissions to third party consultants  million related to software licenses and hardware costs  and million increase in bad debt 
these increases were offset by a decrease in consulting and professional services of million 
sales  general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of revenue 
depreciation and amortization decreased by million due to a decrease of million related to extending the life of the quickbird satellite 
the loss from early extinguishment of debt for was million due to our issuance of senior secured notes with a face value of million in april and repayment in full of our senior credit facility and our senior subordinated notes 
the early extinguishment of debt represents the expensing of the deferred financing costs of million related to the senior credit facility and senior subordinated notes  and includes a prepayment penalty of million related to the senior subordinated notes 
due to an amendment made to our senior secured debt in the first quarter of  our swap arrangements became ineffective for accounting purposes and a million loss was recorded through earnings 
in april  in connection with the repayment of our senior secured notes  our swap was terminated 
the change from interest expense to interest income is primarily due to all interest expense being capitalized in our total costs incurred on worldview exceeded our outstanding debt  whereas only a portion of our interest was capitalized in based on our spending level on the satellite and other projects 
upon operational commissioning of worldview  most of our interest was no longer capitalized 
the decrease in income tax expense is primarily due to a decrease in pre tax income 
in addition  in the second quarter of we made an out of period adjustment  which resulted in an increase in income tax expense of million 
in connection with the preparation of the second quarter income tax provision and the federal income tax return  we became aware of certain adjustments that should have been made to release the valuation allowance that was recorded in the fourth quarter of the net operating loss carry forward recorded as a deferred tax asset as of december   and related income tax benefit for the year ended december  should have been reduced by million  due to tax basis and related tax depreciation differences 
assets the company s total assets increased million in  as compared to  primarily as a result of an increase in cash  deferred taxes and deferred contract costs 
the company s cash balance increased million due to cash flows from operations and reflecting lower expenditures related to construction in progress due to the commissioning of the worldview satellite during the first quarter of and not starting construction on the worldview satellite until late in the third quarter of we anticipate that our cash balance will decrease due to the commencement of capital expenditures related to the worldview satellite and other infrastructure projects 
deferred tax assets increased million for the year this is due to the award of the enhancedview agreement which will generate a significant amount of taxable income in allowing the utilization of a significant portion of the nols within the year 
the deferred tax assets related to these net operating losses were reclassified from net long term deferred tax liabilities to short term deferred tax asset  as we expect to utilize them within one year

liquidity and capital resources we believe that the combination of funds currently available to us and funds expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to finance our operations and development activities for the next twelve months 
our nextview agreement with nga was replaced by the enhancedview agreement which was signed during august we cannot assure you that the us government will continue to purchase earth imagery from us at similar levels or similar terms 
all of our contracts with the us government agencies are subject to risks of termination or reduction in scope due to changes in us government policies and priorities  or reduced congressional funding level commitments 
pursuant to the contract terms  us government agencies can terminate  modify or suspend our contracts at any time with or without cause 
the us government accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  if the us government were not to renew or extend our contract at similar levels or similar terms  we believe we would be able to maintain operations with existing cash and cash equivalents for the next twelve months 
in summary  our cash flows were in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities in  our operating cash flow increased by million to million  primarily as a result of an increase in deferred revenue due to enhancedview and the dafs  offset by cash outflows for deferred contract costs and other changes in working capital 
cash flows used in investing activities decreased from million in to million in  due to the decrease in capital expenditures primarily related to lower construction in progress on new assets 
the decrease in construction in progress is due to the completion and capitalization of the worldview satellite during the first quarter of and materially lower capital expenditures during most of until we commenced construction of worldview late in the third quarter of as disclosed in the contractual obligations table  we have million that is contractually due to third party vendors  due throughout the next four years 
these contractual obligations are primarily related to the procurement and construction of our worldview satellite and related ground systems 
cash provided by financing activities decreased from million provided during to million in during  we paid in full our senior credit facility and senior subordinated notes and received proceeds from the issuance of our senior secured notes resulting in a net cash inflow of million 
we also received million in proceeds of the ipo that occurred during the second quarter of during  there were million of stock option exercises 
in  cash flows provided by operating activities decreased by million from our net income decreased million as compared to  driven by growth in operating expenses at a faster rate than our revenue growth 
this lower net income resulted in a decrease in utilization of net operating losses

adjusted ebitda should not be considered an alternative to net income  as an indication of financial performance  or as an alternative to cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity 
there are limitations to using non gaap financial measures  including the difficulty associated with comparing companies in different industries that use similar performance measures whose calculations may differ from ours 
adjusted ebitda is a key measure used in internal operating reports by management and the board of directors to evaluate the performance of our operations and is also used by analysts  investment banks and lenders for the same purpose 
adjusted ebitda is also a key driver of the company wide bonus incentive plan 
adjusted ebitda is a measure of our current period operating performance  excluding charges for capital  depreciation related to prior period capital expenditures and items which are generally non core in nature  and including enhancedview deferred revenue and enhancedview outstanding invoices not yet paid by nga  and excluding the amortization of pre foc payments related to our nextview contract 
enhancedview outstanding invoices not yet paid by nga represent an irrevocable right to be paid in cash by nga 
we believe that the elimination of material non cash  non operating items enables a more consistent measurement of period to period performance of our operations 
in addition  we believe that elimination of these items in combination with the addition of the nonrefundable enhancedview deferred revenue and enhancedview outstanding invoices not yet paid by nga as well as the elimination of amortization of pre foc payments related to nextview  facilitate comparison of our operating performance to companies in our industry 
we believe this adjusted ebitda measure is particularly important in a capital intensive industry such as ours  in which our current period depreciation is not a good indication of our current or future period capital expenditures 
the cost to construct and launch a satellite and build the related ground infrastructure may vary greatly from one satellite to another  depending on the satellite s size  type and capabilities 
for example  our quickbird satellite  which we are currently depreciating  cost significantly less than our worldview and worldview satellites 
current depreciation expense is not indicative of the revenue generating potential of the satellite 
adjusted ebitda excludes interest income  interest expense  income taxes and loss on early extinguishment of debt because these items are associated with our capitalization and tax structures 
adjusted ebitda also excludes depreciation and amortization expense because these non cash expenses reflect the impact of prior capital expenditure decisions which are not indicative of future capital expenditure requirements 
adjusted ebitda excludes non cash stock compensation expense  because these items are non cash expenses and loss on derivative instrument and disposal of assets because these are not related to our primary operations 
we use adjusted ebitda in conjunction with traditional gaap operating performance measures as part of our overall assessment of our performance and we do not place undue reliance on this measure as our only measure of operating performance 
adjusted ebitda should not be considered a substitute for other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of gaap that require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to our financial statements

revenue recognition our principal source of revenue is the licensing of earth imagery products and services for end users and resellers 
revenue is recognized when the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable and the collection of funds is reasonably assured 
revenue from sales arrangements that include software that is essential to the functionality of non software deliverables is recognized under software accounting guidance 
we have a number of agreements with multiple deliverables that we review to determine whether any or all of the deliverables can be separated from one another 
if separable  arrangement consideration is allocated to the various deliverables based on their relative fair value and recognized for each deliverable when the revenue recognition criteria for that specific deliverable are achieved 
if fair value cannot be determined for the undelivered elements  the delivered elements are combined with the undelivered elements and revenue recognition is determined as a single unit of accounting 
our revenue is generated from i licenses of imagery  ii subscription services and other service arrangements  and iii the recognition of deferred revenue 
we recognize revenue from each of our revenue sources as follows licenses 
revenue from sales of imagery licenses is recognized when the images are physically delivered to the customer or  in the case of electronic delivery  when the customer is able to directly download the image off of our system 
in certain customer arrangements  we have acceptance provisions 
for these arrangements  revenue is recognized upon acceptance by these customers 
revenue is recognized net of contractually agreed discounts

table of contents subscriptions 
the company sells online subscriptions to our products 
these arrangements allow customers access to our products via the internet for a set period of time and a fixed fee 
customers pay for the subscription at the beginning of the subscription period 
the subscription revenue is recorded as deferred revenue and recognized ratably over the subscription period 
in addition  we have other arrangements in which the customer pays for their subscription to one of the company s web based products by paying for a set number of product accesses for instance each time users click on an image of their home 
in the case of prepayment each time a product is accessed  a portion of the customer s prepayment is earned 
these prepayments are recorded as deferred revenue when received and the revenue is recognized based on the number of times the product is accessed 
revenue is recognized net of contractually agreed discounts 
service level agreements 
we recognize service level agreement revenue net of any allowances resulting from failure to meet certain stated monthly performance metrics 
net revenue is either recognized each month because the fee for each month is fixed and non refundable and is for a defined and fixed level of service each month  or based on proportional performance when the level of service each month changes based on certain criteria stated in the agreement 
royalties 
revenue from royalties is based on agreements or licenses with third parties that allow the third party to incorporate our product into their value added product for commercial distribution 
revenue from these royalty arrangements is recorded in the period earned or on a systematic basis over the term of the license agreement 
for those royalties that are due to third parties based on our revenue sharing arrangements  we report royalty revenue on a net basis 
deferred revenue 
occasionally we receive payment for products or services in advance of meeting the criteria for revenue recognition set out above 
these payments are recorded as deferred revenue when received and are recognized as revenue when earned 
if the contract does not have a specified contractual life  we make an assessment as to the likely term of the remaining period of the contractual relationship with the customer 
a review of the contractual relationship is performed by management at least annually  and  as such  the potential amortization of the deferred revenue may be adjusted as appropriate 
the majority of our deferred revenue relates to the following types of arrangements i prepayments from nga and ii the dap 
prepayment from nga 
under the nextview agreement  nga paid us million to partially offset the cost of the construction and launch of worldview these payments were recorded as deferred revenue when received 
when worldview reached foc in november  we began recognizing the deferred revenue on a straight line basis over the year estimated useful life of worldview we will evaluate the estimated life of worldview when events suggest the period may have changed or at least on an annual basis  and may make adjustments to the amortization period if a change to the estimated life of the satellite is made 
as of december  and deferred revenue for these pre payments was million and million  respectively 
under the enhancedview agreement  we are currently receiving a monthly non refundable cash payment of million 
we recognize revenue under the enhancedview agreement using a proportional performance method based upon the percentage of capacity of our constellation made available to nga compared to the total capacity estimated to be provided over the life of the contract 
the difference between the cash received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue  and will be recognized into earnings during the later years of the agreement as additional capacity is provided 
as of december   deferred revenue from the enhancedview agreement was million 
direct access program 
sales under the direct access program include construction of the direct access facility  consisting of hardware  software and operational type maintenance support  and an arrangement to allow the customer access to the satellite to task and download imagery 
this arrangement has been treated as a single unit of accounting as vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for undelivered items cannot be determined nor are believed to have stand alone value 
accordingly  all funds received are initially recorded as deferred revenue and all direct costs of these arrangements are recorded as deferred contract costs 
as the direct access facilities are brought into service  the deferred revenue and deferred contracts costs are amortized ratably over the estimated customer relationship period  which is consistent with the estimated remaining useful life of the satellite being used 
if both satellites are being used  the satellite with the longer life will be used as the basis for the amortization 
based on terms and conditions specified in each arrangement  the facility revenue will be recognized gross or net of facility costs 
access fees under each arrangement are recognized pro rata each month based on actual usage 
as of december  and deferred revenue related to prepayments for the direct access facility  maintenance  and access fees was million and million  respectively 
asset valuation and estimated useful lives of satellites asset valuation includes assessing the recorded value of certain assets  including accounts receivable  goodwill  capitalized contract and related satellite costs and other intangible assets 
we use a variety of factors to assess valuation  depending upon the asset 
accounts receivable are evaluated based upon the creditworthiness of our customers  historical experience  the age of the receivable and current market and economic conditions 
should current market and economic conditions deteriorate or if our other assumptions are not met  our actual bad debt experience could exceed our estimate 
digitalglobe logo page of 
table of contents we capitalize interest  an allocated portion of launch insurance premiums  contract costs and internal direct labor costs incurred 
once a satellite is operational  we depreciate the asset over the expected operational life 
changes in the estimates of the operational life of the asset are reflected in subsequent periods as adjustments to future depreciation expenses 
following each launch  and at least annually thereafter  we review the expected operational life of our satellites 
we determine a satellite s expected operational life using a complex calculation involving the probabilities of failure of the satellite s components from design or manufacturing defects  environmental stresses or other causes 
the expected operational lives of our satellites are affected by a number of factors  including the quality of construction  the supply of fuel  the expected gradual environmental degradation of solar panels and other components  levels of solar radiation  the durability of various satellite components and the orbits in which the satellites are placed 
other intangible assets are evaluated based upon the expected period during which the asset will be utilized  forecasted cash flows  changes in technology and customer demand 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
the fair value of our reporting units is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  which is used to determine if we have a goodwill impairment 
the analysis considers estimated revenue and expense growth rates 
the estimates are based upon our historical experience and projections of future activity  considering customer demand  changes in technology and a cost structure necessary to achieve the related revenue 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could materially impact the value of the asset 
income taxes the current provision for income taxes represents actual or estimated amounts payable or refundable on tax returns filed each year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects attributable to the temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in enacted tax laws is recognized as an adjustment to the tax provision or benefit in the period of enactment 
the overall change in deferred tax assets and liabilities during the period is equal to the deferred tax expense or benefit for the period 
the carrying value of deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based upon the judgmental assessment of available evidence  it is deemed more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realizable 
as of december   there are no income tax positions for which we currently believe that the unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease during the next twelve months 
tax years still open for examination by federal and major state agencies as of december  are through federal and state agencies may disallow research tax carryforwards  net operating loss carryforwards and other carryforwards previously claimed 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset future federal and state taxable income 
if not used  the net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various times during the period from to under section of the internal revenue code of  or the code  in general  an aggregate increase of more than in the percentage ownership in value of our stock by or greater stockholders including public groups over a running three year period constitutes an ownership change for federal income tax purposes 
such an ownership change may limit our ability to use  for both regular and alternative minimum tax purposes  any net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the periods prior to the ownership change 
we believe that such ownership changes have occurred and may occur in the future to further limit the use of our net operating loss carryforwards 
we also believe that any future ownership changes should not have a material adverse effect on the use of our existing net operating loss carryforwards 
in  we generated a taxable loss resulting from accelerated depreciation on the worldview satellite 
current tax law allowed this loss to be carried back to prior years and generated a refund of all previously paid amt 
property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost 
the cost of our satellite includes capitalized interest cost incurred during the construction and development period 
in addition  capitalized costs of our satellite and related ground systems include internal direct labor costs incurred in the construction and development 
ground systems are placed into service when they are ready for their intended use 
while under construction  the costs of our satellites are capitalized during the construction phase  assuming the eventual successful launch and in orbit operation of the satellite 
if a satellite were to fail during launch or while in orbit  the resulting loss would be charged to expense in the period in which such loss were to occur 
the amount of any such loss would be reduced to the extent of insurance proceeds received as a result of the launch or in orbit failure 
digitalglobe logo page of 
table of contents we capitalize certain internal and external software development costs incurred to develop software for internal use 
we expense the costs of developing computer software until the software has reached the application development stage and capitalize all costs incurred from that time until the software is ready for its intended use  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
determination of when the software has reached the application development stage is based upon completion of conceptual designs  evaluation of alternative designs and performance requirements 
costs of major enhancements to internal use software are capitalized while routine maintenance of existing software is charged to expense as incurred 
the determination of when the software is in the application development stage and the ongoing assessment of the recoverability of capitalized computer software development costs requires considerable judgment by management with respect to certain factors  including  but not limited to estimated economic life and changes in software and hardware technology 
internal use capitalized software costs are amortized on a product by product basis over their expected useful life  which is generally three to five years 
software costs that are directly related to a satellite are capitalized with the satellite and amortized over the satellite s useful life 
amortization expense related to capitalized software costs  exclusive of software costs amortized as part of the cost of our satellites  was million  million and million  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets  such as three to seven years for computer equipment and seven to eleven years for most other assets  including the satellite and ground stations 
leasehold improvements and assets used pursuant to capital lease obligations are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of their useful lives or lease terms  such amortization is included in depreciation expense 
upon sale or retirement  the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in operations 
repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred 
accounting for stock options we apply the fair value recognition provisions of stock based compensation expense and measure stock compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize it as expense over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
in order to determine the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant for purposes of calculating the fair value of our stock option grants  we utilize the most recent publicly traded stock price on the grant date 
we established a peer group of comparable publicly traded companies and utilized their reported cash operating earnings and revenue multiples as of each valuation date 
annually  we review the companies that comprise the peer group and  from time to time have changed the composition of the peer group  based on changes to our business or the business of the comparable companies and other factors outside of our control  such as mergers and consolidations 
at each stock option grant date  we utilized the peer group data to calculate our expected volatility 
expected volatility was based on comparable companies four year history for options granted prior to  and five year history for options granted after expected term and forfeiture rate were based on existing employee exercise patterns and our historical pre vested forfeiture experience 
the risk free rate was based on an average of the yields of the treasury note with a maturity corresponding to the expected term of the option assumed at the grant date 
changes to the underlying assumptions  including increased forfeiture rates  may have a significant impact on the underlying value of the stock options  which could have a material impact on our financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements from time to time  the fasb or other standards setting bodies issue new accounting pronouncements 
updates to the fasb accounting standards codification asc are communicated through issuance of an accounting standards update asu 
in october  the fasb issued asu  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements and asu  certain revenue arrangements that include software elements 
asu and asu are required to be adopted concurrently in fiscal years beginning on or after june  fiscal year for digitalglobe 
asu changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each deliverable based on the relative selling price 
the selling price for each deliverable is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe if available  third party evidence tpe if vsoe is not available  or best estimate selling price besp if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
asu excludes software that is contained on a tangible product from the scope of software revenue guidance if the software is essential to the tangible product s functionality 
asu and asu were adopted prospectively january  the adoption could have a material impact on the presentation  classification and recognition of revenue for multiple element arrangements in our financial statements 
digitalglobe logo page of 
table of contents in january  the fasb issued new guidance that requires new disclosures for fair value measurements and provides clarification for existing disclosures requirements 
more specifically  it requires reporting entities to disclose separately the amount of significant transfers into and out of level and level fair value measurements and to describe the reasons for the transfers  and provide information on purchases  sales  issuances and settlements on a gross basis rather than net in the reconciliation of level fair value measurements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the level fair value measurements disclosures that are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of the updated guidance will not have an effect on the company s financial statements 
seasonality seasonality has not and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our business in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not currently have any material interest rate risk exposure
