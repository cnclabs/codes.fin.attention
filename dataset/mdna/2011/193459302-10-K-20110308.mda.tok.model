we assume no obligation to update any of these forward looking statements 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in this report 
overview and outlook our demand levels for increased significantly from levels as the industry and most of our end markets experienced a year of improving economic conditions 
overall  our volumes  measured in total pounds shipped  
table of contents increased in compared to  with relatively stronger increases in our oem business  as well as in industrial related product categories  as market demand in both areas was favorably impacted by increased industrial output in the us from levels 
other areas remain challenging  however  with particular weakness persisting in those channels and product categories linked to construction end markets 
additionally  overall demand levels in the us remain below pre recessionary levels  as the magnitude of economic growth and recovery in the developing world has outpaced that in the us this coupled with excess capacity in the wire and cable industry has continued to cause pricing pressure which was exacerbated during the second half of by a sharp rise in copper prices 
such price fluctuations can significantly impact our sales and profitability  as copper constitutes the primary component of our product input costs  accounting for approximately of our total costs of goods sold in the sharp increase in copper prices during the second half of appeared to reflect a number of factors  including increased end user demand  particularly within developing countries  as well as heightened financial and investor interest in a range of commodity based investments  including copper 
as a result  the average monthly price of copper cathode on the comex increased during each successive month during the second half of  with a total increase of recorded between the monthly average of per pound for june and an average of per pound in december copper prices have continued to increase during the first two months of  with the average monthly price of copper on the comex reaching in february these sharp price increases can reduce the spread between the cost of copper in our products and the prices we are able to charge for our products  as was the case during the second half of  when we experienced a degree of gross profit contraction 
despite the challenges posed by such factors  our overall financial and operating performance in was strong earnings of per diluted share for  as compared to a loss of per diluted share for on an adjusted basis  we recorded adjusted eps of per common share  as compared to adjusted eps of per share in  ebitda for reached million  as compared to ebitda of million in on an adjusted basis  we recorded adjusted ebitda of million in  as compared to adjusted ebitda of million in  overall reported revenues increased in to million as compared to million in  with an increase of in total volume shipped  strong improvement in both oem and distribution operating income  with increases of and  respectively  recorded in as compared to  had no borrowings outstanding under our million revolving credit facility at the end of  with combined cash and excess availability of million at year end  and we issued million in senior unsecured notes due  which refinanced million of debt due  and provided excess cash to fund future acquisitions or other investments to grow our business 
both the above noted gaap results and non gaap measures  including our definition of such non gaap measures and their reconciliation to gaap measures  are set forth in greater detail as part of the consolidated results of operations section that follows 
looking to  we anticipate continued modest growth in demand for both our distribution and oem businesses  though year over year comparisons will likely be subdued given the rebound experienced in 
table of contents from levels 
commodity prices remain a concern 
further fluctuations in copper prices  or in other raw material inputs such as petroleum based compounds or transportation costs  could impact our profitability 
in addition  despite more favorable economic conditions overall  a number of end markets such as commercial and residential construction remained soft in  and any meaningful recovery in within these end markets appears unlikely 
we believe that softness in such areas  however  will be balanced by potentially increased volume levels in industrial end markets 
we generated strong results in in part from proactively managing our business during the downturn of and we believe the actions we took to adjust and realign our capacity and expense structure during the downturn were key in our ability to capitalize on the improved economic conditions and demand levels for if general us economic conditions continue to improve in  we would expect to benefit given the diversity of our product offering despite challenges which may persist in particular end markets  and we remain confident the company is well positioned heading into we have and intend to continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that have the potential to materially increase the size of our business operation or provide us with strategic advantage 
the consummation of any acquisition  including those currently under consideration  may result in increased borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  our consolidated statement of operations data in thousands of dollars and as a percentage of net sales 
year ended december  amount amount in thousands  except per share data net sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses intangible asset amortization asset impairments restructuring charges operating income loss interest expense gain on repurchase of senior notes loss on extinguishment of senior notes other income income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss diluted earnings loss per share in addition to net income determined in accordance with gaap  we use certain non gaap measures in assessing our operating performance 
these non gaap measures used by management include ebitda  which we define as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expense ebitda  adjusted ebitda  which is our measure of ebitda adjusted to exclude the impact of certain specifically identified items adjusted ebitda  and adjusted earnings per share  which we calculate as diluted earnings per share adjusted to exclude the estimated per share impact of the same specifically identified items used to calculate adjusted ebitda adjusted eps 
for the periods presented in this report  the specifically identified items include asset impairments and restructuring charges  gains on our repurchase of our 
table of contents senior notes in  the loss recorded in connection with the extinguishment of our senior notes in  share based compensation expense  and foreign currency transaction gains recorded at our canadian subsidiary 
we believe both ebitda and adjusted ebitda serve as appropriate measures to be used in evaluating the performance of our business 
we employ the use of these measures in the preparation of our annual operating budgets and in determining levels of operating and capital investments 
we believe both ebitda and adjusted ebitda allow us to readily view operating trends  perform analytical comparisons and identify strategies to improve operating performance 
we also believe both ebitda and adjusted ebitda are performance measures that provide investors  securities analysts and other interested parties a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures  business acquisitions  capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies in our industry 
however  the usefulness of both ebitda and adjusted ebitda as performance measures are limited by the fact that they both exclude the impact of interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense  and taxes 
we borrow money in order to finance our operations  therefore  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate revenue 
similarly  our use of capital assets makes depreciation and amortization expense a necessary element of our costs and ability to generate income 
since we are subject to state and federal income taxes  any measure that excludes tax expense has material limitations 
due to these limitations  we do not  and you should not  use either ebitda or adjusted ebitda as the only measures of our performance 
we also use  and recommend that you consider  net income in accordance with gaap as a measure of our performance 
finally  other companies may define ebitda and adjusted ebitda differently and  as a result  our measure of ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to ebitda and adjusted ebitda measures of other companies 
similarly  we believe our use of adjusted eps provides an appropriate measure to use in assessing our performance across periods given that this measure provides an adjustment for certain significant items  the magnitude of which may vary significantly from period to period 
however  we do not  and do not recommend that you  solely use adjusted eps to assess our financial and earnings performance 
we also use  and recommend that you use  diluted earnings per share in addition to adjusted eps in assessing our earnings performance 
finally  other companies may define adjusted eps differently and  as a result  our measure of adjusted eps may not be directly comparable to adjusted eps measures of other companies 
the following tables  which reconcile our measure of adjusted eps to diluted earnings per share  and ebitda and adjusted ebitda to net income  respectively  should be used along with the above statements of operations for the periods presented  in conjunction with the results of operations review that follows 
diluted earnings per share  as determined in accordance with gaap  to adjusted eps year ended december  diluted earnings loss per share asset impairments restructuring charges loss gain on extinguishment repurchase of debt share based compensation expense foreign currency transaction gain adjusted eps 
table of contents net income  as determined in accordance with gaap  to ebitda and adjusted ebitda year ended december  in thousands net income loss interest expense a income tax expense benefit depreciation and amortization expense a ebitda asset impairments restructuring charges loss gain on extinguishment repurchase of debt share based compensation expense foreign currency transaction gain adjusted ebitda a depreciation and amortization expense shown in the above schedule excludes amortization of debt issuance costs  which are included as a component of interest expense 
the nature of each individual item set forth in the table above which has been excluded from net income and ebitda in order to arrive at our measures of adjusted eps and adjusted ebitda  respectively  for each of the periods presented is detailed in the analysis of operating results that follows 
earnings and performance summary we recorded net income of million or per diluted share in  as compared to a net loss of million or a loss of per diluted share for for  we recorded ebitda of million as compared to ebitda of million in as set forth below  results for these periods were impacted by certain items  the magnitude of which may vary significantly from period to period and  thereby  have a disproportionate effect on the earnings reported for any given period 
the income statement review below contains further detail regarding each of these items 
asset impairments we recorded million million after tax  or per diluted share and million million after tax  or per diluted share in non cash asset impairments in and  respectively 
the million in asset impairments recorded in related to properties held for sale 
the million asset impairment recorded in was primarily a result of a non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded during the first quarter of relative to our distribution segment 
restructuring charges our results for and included million million after tax or per diluted share and million million after tax or per diluted share  respectively  in restructuring charges primarily related to lease liabilities associated with certain leased facilities closed during which were acquired as part of business acquisitions completed in  as well as our two plant closures 
loss gain on extinguishment repurchase of senior notes we refinanced our senior notes during the first quarter of by issuing million in senior notes 
we recorded a loss of million million after tax  or per diluted share associated with this refinancing 
in  we repurchased approximately million in aggregate par value of our senior notes and recorded an associated gain of million million after tax  or per diluted share 
share based compensation expense our results for and included share based compensation expense of million million after tax or per diluted share and million million 
table of contents after tax or per diluted share  respectively 
share based compensation is excluded from our measures of adjusted ebitda and adjusted eps in order for such measures to more closely reflect a measure of underlying operating results given periodic fluctuations in the estimated fair value of a significant portion of the underlying share based instruments 
foreign currency transaction gain we recorded a foreign currency transaction gain of million million after tax  or per diluted share in and foreign currency transaction gain of million million after tax  or per diluted share in related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations at our canadian subsidiary 
excluding the impact of the above noted items  our results for as compared to  primarily reflected the impact of improved market conditions which have resulted in increased demand levels  and the favorable impact of such increased demand on our profitability  primarily in the form of higher overall gross profit 
the following is a reconciliation for the periods indicated of cash flow from operating activities  as determined in accordance with gaap  to ebitda 
year ended december  in thousands net cash flow from operating activities interest expense income tax expense benefit deferred taxes loss on disposals of fixed assets share based compensation expense gain loss on repurchase extinguishment of debt asset impairments foreign currency transaction gain amortization of debt issuance costs a changes in operating assets and liabilities ebitda a amortization of debt issuance costs are included within depreciation and amortization for cash flow presentation  and are included as a component of interest expense for income statement presentation 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  net sales year ended december  amount percent of total amount percent of total in thousands net sales distribution oem total segments our net sales for were million compared to million for  an increase of million  or 
the increase in net sales reflected both higher average copper prices and higher sales volumes for as compared to during  the average daily selling price of copper cathode on the comex was per pound as compared to an average of per pound in  an increase of 
our total sales volume measured in total pounds shipped increased for million pounds compared to 
table of contents million pounds  with volumes increasing in our distribution segment million pounds in  compared to million in and in our oem segment million pounds in  compared to million pounds in 
the overall increase reflected improved overall market conditions and  to a lesser degree  volume added as a result of new products introduced in the relatively higher year over year volume growth within our oem segment reflected the impact of increased demand in from existing customers that had been particularly affected by the global economic downturn in we anticipate overall demand levels will improve modestly in as compared to measures of year over year volume growth  particularly within oem  will likely be muted in  however  as such year over year growth measures for were favorably impacted by the sharp rebound in demand from the downturn of additionally  while we anticipate modest demand increases for  overall demand remains below pre recessionary levels 
we therefore remain cautious given the potential for additional pricing pressure in light of this fact coupled with excess capacity in the wire and cable industry  and uncertainty regarding the overall sustainability of the economic recovery 
gross profit we generated million in total gross profit for  as compared to million in  an increase of million  or 
the significant increase in gross profit primarily reflected the impact of the above noted volume increases  with increased gross profit being recorded in both our distribution and oem segments as compared to the increase also reflected the favorable impact of lower overhead variances and increased expense leverage as our fixed costs were spread over an increased net sales base 
our gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross profit rate was for  as compared to for the decline in our gross profit rate primarily reflected the impact of a rapid rise in copper prices during the second half of  partially offset by improved leverage of fixed costs in given higher overall sales levels as compared to the average monthly price of copper cathode on the comex increased during each successive month during the second half of  with a total increase of recorded between the june average of per pound and an average of per pound for december a portion of our business  roughly of total volume for  is priced to generate a constant amount of gross profit per pound sold which causes a contraction in gross profit rates as copper prices increase 
further to this fact  the degree and rapid rate of copper price increases experienced during the second half of  coupled with marketplace pricing pressure in light of excess industry capacity  combined to cause a lowering in the spread between the cost of copper in our manufactured products and the prices we were able to charge for our products which resulted in gross profit rate contraction during second half of selling  general and administrative sg a expense we incurred total sg a expense of million for  as compared to million for  which represented an increase of million  or 
however  our sg a as a percentage of total net sales decreased to for  as compared to for this decline in the sg a rate reflected the favorable impact of increased expense leverage as our fixed costs were spread over a higher net sales base 
the million increase was due primarily to a million increase in commission expenses given higher sales volumes in compared to  and increase in payroll related expenses of million  primarily due to discretionary bonuses given improved overall performance  and a net increase of million across a number of general expense areas 
intangible amortization expense intangible amortization expense for was million as compared to million for  with the expense in both periods arising from the amortization of intangible assets recorded in relation to prior acquisitions occurring in these intangible assets are amortized using an accelerated amortization method which reflects our estimate of the pattern in which the economic benefit derived from such assets is to be consumed 
amortization expense for was lower than in primarily as a function of the impact of the aforementioned accelerated amortization methodology 
asset impairments we recorded a total of million in asset impairments in for write downs associated with properties being held for sale  as compared to a million asset impairment recorded in  which was primarily comprised of a non cash goodwill impairment charge 
during the first quarter of  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment analysis based on a combination of factors which were in existence at that time  including a significant decline in our 
table of contents market capitalization during the first quarter of  as well as the recessionary economic environment in existence at that time and its then estimated potential impact on our business 
as a result of performing the related impairment test during the first quarter of  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  which represented impairment charges incurred within three of the four reporting units within our distribution segment electrical distribution  wire and cable distribution and industrial distribution 
further goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur  including further deterioration in the macro economic environment or in the equity markets  including the market value of our common shares  deterioration in our performance or our future projections  or changes in our plans for our businesses 
the remaining million in asset impairment charges recorded in related to write downs of certain closed properties which have since been sold 
restructuring charges restructuring charges were million in  as compared to million for for both years  these expenses were comprised of holding costs incurred relative to facilities we closed in and  with the expense also including severance costs related to facility closures in that year 
in  we closed both our east long meadow  massachusetts and oswego  new york facilities 
entering  we had a total of nine closed facilities  consisting of five leased and four owned facilities 
during  we sold three of the four owned facilities  and negotiated an early termination of the leases for two of the five leased facilities 
as a result  at the end of  we had four closed facilities remaining  three of which are leased for various lengths of time through  and one of which is owned  and for which we are obligated to pay holding costs 
we do not currently have any significant restructuring initiatives planned for accordingly  we anticipate incurring between million and million in restructuring costs in related to existing closed facilities  without giving effect to our successfully negotiating any potential sales  alterations to or additional subleases  or lease buy outs in relation to one or more of these properties 
however  it should be noted that management is continually adjusting plans and production schedules in light of sales trends  the macro economic environment and other demand indicators  and the possibility exists that we may determine further plant closings  restructurings and workforce reductions are necessary  some of which may be significant 
operating income the following table sets forth operating income by segment  in thousands of dollars and segment operating income as a percentage of segment net sales 
year ended december  amount amount in thousands operating income loss distribution oem total segments corporate consolidated operating income loss operating income represents income from continuing operations before interest expense  other income or expense  and income taxes 
corporate consists of items not charged or allocated to the segments  including costs for employee relocation  discretionary bonuses  professional fees  restructuring expenses  asset impairments  share based compensation  and intangible amortization 
our segments have common production processes  and manufacturing and distribution capacity 
accordingly  we do not identify net assets to our segments 
the accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in part ii  item of this document 
distribution segment operating income was million for  as compared to million for  an increase of million  primarily reflecting the above noted impact of increased sales volumes in  
table of contents partially offset by higher sg a expense 
our segment operating income rate was for  as compared to for the decline in the operating income rate in was primarily due to the above noted decline in our gross profit rate  primarily due to higher copper prices and market pricing pressure 
oem segment operating income was million for  as compared to an operating income of million for  an increase of million  primarily reflecting the above noted impact of increased sales volumes in  partially offset by higher sg a expense 
our segment operating income rate was for  as compared to for the increase in the operating income rate was primarily due to increased expense leverage of fixed expenses given the higher sales base for as compared to interest expense we incurred million in interest expense for  as compared to million for the increase in interest expense was due primarily to higher average outstanding borrowings in as compared to the same time period last year 
gain on repurchase of senior notes we recorded a million gain in resulting from our repurchase of million in aggregate par value of our senior notes 
loss on extinguishment of senior notes we recorded a loss of million in on the early extinguishment of our senior notes 
this amount included the write off of approximately million of remaining unamortized debt issuance costs and bond premium amounts related to the senior notes  as well as the impact of the call and tender premiums paid in connection with the refinancing 
other income we recorded other income of million and million in and  respectively  with the amounts in both years reflecting the impact of exchange rate changes at our canadian subsidiary 
income tax expense benefit we recorded income tax expense of million in  compared to an income tax benefit of million for our effective tax rate for was compared to an effective tax rate of for this increase in our effective tax rate primarily reflects the impact of the million pre tax  non cash goodwill impairment charge recorded during a significant amount of the related goodwill did not have a corresponding tax basis  thereby reducing the associated tax benefit for the pre tax charge 
the difference from the federal statutory rate in both periods also reflected the fact that we utilized a tax credit 
net sales by groups of products net sales across our four major product lines were as follows year ended december  net sales by groups of products in thousands industrial wire and cable assembled wire and cable products electronic wire fabricated bare wire total as noted previously  we are organized internally according to the customers we serve  which is reflected in the structure of our reportable segments oem and distribution 
therefore  we do not focus internally on the operating performance or profitability of our business by product grouping 
in relation to the data presented above  however  we note that all product categories experienced net sales increases in as compared to  primarily reflective of improved overall market conditions and increased copper prices 
as noted above  the price of copper on the comex  averaged for  an increase of from the more pronounced increase in net sales within the industrial wire and cable product grouping as compared to the other product groupings  in part reflected both an increase in the placement of new products in and strong market demand improvement in this area as industrial output in the us increased from levels 
net sales within assembled 
table of contents wire and cable products benefited from underlying volume growth 
while we do not have visibility to the specific end markets into which our products are ultimately sold  based on the nature of  and general applications for such products  we believe the relatively lower level of growth within the electronic wire grouping is reflective of the fact that a portion of the products within this category  such as thermostat and irrigation wire  are used in residential and commercial construction  which have not returned to pre recessionary volume levels 
conversely  the relatively higher level of growth in net sales recorded within fabricated bare wire reflected improved volume as well as the impact on net sales from higher copper prices given the high copper content of such products 
liquidity and capital resources debt our outstanding debt including capital lease obligations was as follows as of december  in thousands revolving credit facility expiring april  senior notes due february  and senior notes extinguished january  respectively capital lease obligations total debt as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million as of december  we also had approximately million in remaining excess availability under our revolving credit facility at december   as compared to million of excess availability at december  senior secured revolving credit facility our revolving credit facility  which expires april   is a senior secured facility that provides for aggregate borrowings of up to million  subject to certain limitations as discussed below revolving credit facility 
the proceeds from the revolving credit facility are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes  including merger and acquisition activity 
interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility is payable  at our option  at the lender s prime rate plus a range of to or the eurodollar rate plus a range of to  in each case based on quarterly average excess availability under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  we pay a unused line fee pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility for unutilized availability 
pursuant to the terms of the revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain a minimum of million in excess availability under the facility at all times 
borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility is limited to the lesser of million or the sum of of eligible accounts receivable  of eligible inventory and an advance rate to be determined of certain appraised fixed assets  with a million sublimit for letters of credit 
borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility for foreign subsidiaries is limited to the greater of the sum of of the aggregate book value of accounts receivable of such foreign subsidiaries plus of the aggregate book value of the inventory of such foreign subsidiaries and million excluding permitted intercompany indebtedness of such foreign subsidiaries 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by our domestic subsidiary and is secured by substantially all of our assets and the assets of our domestic subsidiary  including accounts receivable  inventory and any other tangible and intangible assets including real estate  machinery and equipment and intellectual property as well as by a pledge of all the capital stock of our domestic subsidiary and of the capital stock of our canadian foreign subsidiary  but not our chinese owned entity 

table of contents the revolving credit facility contains financial and other covenants that limit or restrict our ability to pay dividends or distributions  incur indebtedness  permit liens on property  make investments  provide guarantees  enter into mergers  acquisitions or consolidations  conduct asset sales  enter into leases or sale and lease back transactions  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
in addition to maintaining a minimum of million in excess availability under the facility at all times  the financial covenants in the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to for any month during which our excess availability under the revolving credit facility falls below million 
we maintained greater than million of monthly excess availability during refinancing of senior notes with senior notes in the first quarter of  in order to take advantage of what we believed were favorable refinancing conditions  we undertook a refinancing of our senior notes in order to extend the maturity date of such long term  unsecured debt  and lower the coupon rate on such debt 
in total  we issued million of senior notes defined below  which resulted in million in proceeds after giving effect to million in original issuance discounts and million of prepaid interest 
a portion of these proceeds were used to retire million in par value of our remaining senior notes  and the remainder is available to be used in the future for general corporate purposes  including potential acquisitions 
as detailed below  the issuance of our senior notes occurred in two parts  both completed during the first quarter of on february  we completed a private placement under rule a under the securities act of  as amended the securities act of million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due in the initial private placement to refinance our senior notes 
the initial private placement resulted in gross proceeds of approximately million  which reflects a discounted issue price of of the principal amount 
the proceeds were used  together with other available funds  for payment of consideration and costs related to a cash tender offer and consent solicitation for our senior notes 
a total of million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes were tendered  which represented approximately of the million aggregate principal amount of the senior notes outstanding 
we redeemed the remaining million of senior notes on march  on march   we completed another private placement offering under rule a under the securities act the supplemental private placement of million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes due in together with the senior notes offered in the initial private placement  the senior notes 
we received gross proceeds from the supplemental private placement of approximately million  which reflects a discounted issue price of of the principal amount 
the proceeds were used  together with the proceeds of the initial private placement  for payment of consideration and costs relating to a cash tender offer for the final million of original senior note redemptions 
the senior notes mature on february  and interest on these notes accrues at a rate of per annum and is payable semi annually on each february and august pursuant to the terms of registration rights agreements we entered into in connection with the issuance of the senior notes  we agreed  among other things  to exchange the senior notes for registered notes substantially identical in all material respects to the senior notes the exchange notes 
with the exchange offer  million  or  of the outstanding senior notes were exchanged for exchange notes on july  we recorded a loss of million in the first quarter of on the early extinguishment of our senior notes 
this amount included the write off of approximately million of remaining unamortized debt issuance costs and bond premium amounts related to the senior notes  as well as the impact of the call and tender premiums paid in connection with the refinancing 
in connection with the issuance of senior notes  we incurred approximately million in costs that have been recorded as deferred financing costs to be amortized over the term of the senior notes 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the covenants of our senior notes 

table of contents current and future liquidity in general  we require cash for working capital  capital expenditures  debt repayment and interest 
our working capital requirements tend to increase when we experience significant increased demand for products or significant copper price increases 
accordingly  we may be required to borrow against our revolving credit facility in the future if  among a number of other potential factors  the price of copper continues to increase  thereby increasing our working capital requirements 
our management assesses the future cash needs of our business by considering a number of factors  including historical earnings and cash flow performance  future working capital needs  current and projected debt service expenses  planned capital expenditures  and our ability to borrow additional funds under the terms of our revolving credit facility 
based on the foregoing  we believe that our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  meet our debt service requirements and fund our planned capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions for the foreseeable future 
we have initiated renegotiation of the revolving credit facility and anticipate completing its renegotiation in the next twelve months 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings against our million revolving credit facility and a corresponding million in excess availability as well as million in cash on hand 
if we experience a deficiency in earnings with respect to our fixed charges in the future  we would need to fund the fixed charges through a combination of cash flows from operations and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
if cash flows generated from our operations  together with borrowings under our revolving credit facility  are not sufficient to fund our operations  meet our debt service requirements and fund our planned capital expenditures and we need to seek additional sources of capital  the limitations on our ability to incur debt contained in the revolving credit facility and the indenture relating to our senior notes could prevent us from securing additional capital through the issuance of debt 
in that case  we would need to secure additional capital through other means  such as the issuance of equity 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain additional debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
if we were not able to secure additional capital  we could be required to delay or forego capital spending or other corporate initiatives  such as the development of products  or acquisition opportunities 
our revolving credit facility permits us to redeem  retire or repurchase our senior notes subject to certain limitations 
we may repurchase senior notes in the future but whether we do so will depend on a number of factors and there can be no assurance that we will repurchase any amounts of our senior notes 
cash flow summary a summary of our cash flows for and was as follows as of december  in thousands net income loss non cash items changes in working capital assets and liabilities net cash from operating activities net cash from investing activities net cash from financing activities effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and equivalents at beginning of year cash and equivalents at end of year 
table of contents operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for and  respectively 
the million decline in cash provided by operating activities for as compared to was largely the result of the impact of changes in working capital items  primarily changes in accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable 
increased accounts receivable levels at december   as compared to december   resulted in a net use of million of cash related to accounts receivable during our accounts receivable balance was million at the end of  a increase from the balance of million in outstanding accounts receivable at the end of  with the increase attributable mainly to increased sales in the fourth quarter of  as compared to the fourth quarter of this increase was reflective of increased demand levels manifested in higher volumes  as well as increased copper prices 
similarly  increased inventory levels at december   as compared to december   resulted in a net use of million of cash related to inventory during our inventory balance was million at the end of  a increase from the balance of million in inventory at the end of  with the increase reflecting the impact of increased copper prices and production levels given higher demand  partially offset by an improvement in inventory turnover 
the year over year impact on operating cash flows of changes in accounts receivable and inventory levels was partially offset by changes in our accounts payable levels over the same period 
for  we recorded million in cash provided by accounts payable as accounts payable levels at the end of were higher than at the end of primarily as a function of increased payables brought about by the above noted increased inventory levels over the same time period 
investing activities net cash utilized for investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
the primary use of cash for investing activities in both and was for capital expenditures  mainly new production equipment 
we had a total of million in capital expenditures in as compared to million in we would expect our capital expenditures to approximate levels 
in addition  during  we generated million in proceeds from the disposal of fixed assets  primarily in connection with the sale of three properties we had previously closed  and we used million in cash to fund certain investments 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million in  as compared to a net use of million in cash for financing activities in net cash provided by financing activities for was due primarily to the issuance of our senior notes and extinguishment of our senior notes 
we generated proceeds of million from the issuance of the senior notes 
in connection therewith  we incurred million in issuance costs and used million of the total proceeds to retire our senior notes  inclusive of accrued interest and other extinguishment costs 
in addition we repaid our outstanding revolving credit facility balance of approximately million in the first quarter of the million used in financing activities for included million in net repayments made under our revolving credit facility during due to a reduction in debt primarily brought about by efforts to reduce our levels of working capital  million used to repurchase a portion of our senior notes  and million paid to amend our revolving credit facility 
seasonality we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  certain seasonal trends in our net sales and cash flow 
we generally require increased levels of cash during the second and third quarters of the year to build inventories in anticipation of higher demand during the late fall and early winter months 
in general  the trade receivables generated from these periods of relatively higher sales is subsequently collected during the late fourth and early first quarter of each year 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize sales of our products when the products are shipped to customers and title passes to the customer in accordance with the terms of sale 
we provide incentive allowances to our customers  with the amount of such promotional allowances being tied primarily to the particular customer s level of purchasing activity during a specified time period or periods 
we record an accrual for such promotional allowances and reflect the expenses as a reduction of our net sales when we determine that it is probable the allowances will be earned by the customer and the amount of the allowances can be reasonably estimated 
we base our accruals primarily on sales activity and our historical experience with each customer 
allowance for uncollectible accounts we record an allowance for uncollectible accounts to reflect management s best estimate of losses inherent in our receivables as of the balance sheet date given the facts available to us at the time the allowance is recorded 
establishing this allowance involves considerable judgment 
in calculating the necessary allowance for uncollectible accounts  we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers 
we consider both the current financial condition of individual customers and historical write off patterns in establishing our allowance 
when we become aware that  due to deterioration of their financial condition or for some other reason  a particular customer is unable or unwilling to pay an amount owed to us  we record a specific allowance for receivables related to that customer to reflect our best estimate of the realizability of amounts owed 
actual future collections of receivables could differ significantly from our estimates as a function of future  unforeseen changes in general  industry and specific customers financial conditions 
in addition  we reserve for customer credits and discounts expected to be issued relative to our accounts receivable balance 
these reserves are intended to reflect an estimate of future credits and discounts that are probable of issuance in relation to the existing accounts receivable balance  and these estimates are based on historical experience 
inventories inventories include material  labor and overhead costs and are recorded at the lower of cost or market using the first in first out fifo method 
in applying fifo  we evaluate the realizability of our inventory on a product by product basis 
in circumstances where inventory levels are in excess of anticipated market demand  where inventory is deemed technologically obsolete or not saleable due to its condition or where the inventory cost for an item exceeds its net realizable value  we record a charge to cost of goods sold and reduce the inventory to its net realizable value 
copper constitutes our primary inventory component 
plant and equipment and other long lived assets plant and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from three to twenty years  using principally the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax reporting purposes 
our other long lived assets consist primarily of customer related intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions occurring in these intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using an accelerated amortization methodology which reflects our estimate of the pattern in which the economic benefit derived from such assets is to be consumed 
the carrying value of all long lived assets is evaluated periodically to determine if adjustment to the depreciation period or the carrying value is 
table of contents warranted 
when events and circumstances indicate that our long lived assets should be reviewed for possible impairment  we test for the existence of impairment by developing and utilizing projections of future cash flows expected to be generated from the use and eventual disposition of the assets or asset groups in question 
our asset groups reflect the shared nature of our facilities and manufacturing capacity 
expected cash flows are projected on an undiscounted basis over the remaining life of the assets or asset groups in question to determine whether such cash flows are expected to exceed the recorded carrying amount of the assets involved 
if we identify the existence of impairment as a result of this test  we determine the amount of the impairment loss by the extent to which the carrying value of the impaired assets exceed their fair values as determined by valuation techniques including  as appropriate  the use of discounted cash flows to measure estimated fair value 
the long lived asset impairment test uses significant assumptions  estimates and judgments  and is subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity 
estimating projected cash flows associated with our asset groups involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to numerous factors  including future sales  gross profit  selling  general and administrative expense rates  and cash flows 
the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments  such as the estimated future undiscounted cash flows  could significantly increase or decrease the related impairment test results 
goodwill and other intangible assets under goodwill accounting rules  we are required to assess goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill employs a two step process 
the first step involves the estimation of fair value of our reporting units 
if step one indicates that impairment of goodwill potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment exists when the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment test as of december   with no indication of potential impairment 
our test indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with recorded goodwill as of december  was significantly in excess of its related carrying value  with no such reporting unit having an excess of fair value less than of its carrying value 
as stated below  the use of different assumptions  estimates or judgments in the goodwill impairment testing process may significantly increase or decrease the estimated fair value of a reporting unit 
however  as of the december  annual impairment test date  the above noted conclusion  that no indication of goodwill impairment existed as of the test date  would not have changed had the test been conducted assuming a decrease in the aggregate estimated undiscounted cash flows of our reporting units without any change in the discount rate  a basis point increase in the discount rate used to discount the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units to their net present value in determining their estimated fair values without any change in the aggregate estimated cash flows of our reporting units  or decrease in the estimated sales growth rate without a change in the discount rate of each reporting unit 
goodwill impairment charges may be recognized in future periods to the extent changes in factors or circumstances occur  including deterioration in the macro economic environment or in the equity markets  including the market value of our common shares  deterioration in our performance or our future projections  or changes in our plans for one or more reporting units 
during the first quarter of  we concluded that there were sufficient indicators to require us to perform an interim goodwill impairment test based on a combination of factors which were in existence at that time  including a significant decline in our market capitalization  as well as the recessionary economic environment and its then estimated potential impact on our business 
as a result of this test  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  representing our best estimate of the impairment loss incurred within three of the four reporting units comprising our distribution segment electrical distribution  wire and cable distribution and industrial distribution 

table of contents the goodwill impairment testing process involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments  and is subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity 
estimating a reporting unit s projected cash flows involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to numerous factors  including future sales  gross profit  selling  general and administrative expense rates  capital expenditures  and cash flows 
these estimates are based on our business plans and forecasts 
these estimates are then discounted  which necessitates the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the discount rates used reflect market based estimates of the risks associated with the projected cash flows of the reporting unit 
the allocation of the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the estimated fair value of their net assets required under the second step of the goodwill impairment test also involves the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments  which are based on the best information available to management as of the date of the assessment 
we test the carrying amount of our long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets and property  plant and equipment  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
this assessment employs a two step approach 
the first step is used to determine if a potential impairment exists while the second step measures the associated impairment loss if any 
an impairment loss is recognized if  in performing the impairment review  it is determined that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset or asset group and its eventual disposition 
the asset groups tested under our impairment tests reflect the shared nature of our facilities and manufacturing capacity 
the second step of the impairment tests involves measuring the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded 
the amount of the impairment loss recorded is equal to the excess of the asset or asset group s carrying value over its fair value 
for and  no asset impairments were identified relative to either our long lived property  plant and equipment or our finite lived intangible assets  other than among assets held for sale 
the long lived asset impairment test uses significant assumptions  estimates and judgments  and is subject to inherent uncertainties and subjectivity 
estimating projected cash flows associated with our asset groups involved the use of significant assumptions  estimates and judgments with respect to numerous factors  including future sales  gross profit  selling  general and administrative expense rates  discount rates and cash flows 
income taxes we use the asset and liability approach in accounting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
a provision for income tax expense is recognized for income taxes payable for the current period  plus the net changes in deferred tax amounts adjusted for other comprehensive income 
we periodically assess the realizability of deferred tax assets and the adequacy of deferred tax liabilities  including the results of local  state or federal tax audits 
new accounting pronouncements goodwill in december  the fasb issued an update to the accounting guidance for evaluating goodwill for impairment 
accordingly  new accounting standards concerning the treatment of goodwill were issued 
this guidance addresses the effects on certain provisions of evaluating reporting units with zero or negative carrying values 
the accounting update is effective for a reporting entity s first annual reporting period that begins after december  for interim periods within that first annual reporting period and for interim and annual reporting periods thereafter 
we do not anticipate that this guidance  which is effective for the first quarter of  will have a significant impact on our financial statements 
variable interest entity in june  the fasb issued an update to the accounting guidance for consolidation 
accordingly  new accounting standards concerning the treatment of variable interest entities were issued 
this guidance addresses 
table of contents the effects on certain provisions of consolidation of variable interest entities as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept 
this guidance also addresses the ability to provide timely and useful information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this update  which was effective for the first quarter of  did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
disclosures about fair value measurements in january  the fasb issued an accounting standards update to improve disclosures about fair value measurements 
the update amends existing accounting rules regarding fair value measurements and disclosures to add new requirements for disclosures related to transfers into and out of investment levels and  and separate disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level investment measurements 
it also clarifies existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation  as well as inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the update is effective for the first reporting period beginning after december   except for the requirement to provide the level activity of purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements on a gross basis  which will be effective for years beginning after december  as this update only related to financial statement disclosures  it did not have an impact on our results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
see note for further discussion regarding our fair value measurements of financial assets and liabilities
