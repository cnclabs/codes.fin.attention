item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for further discussion of our indebtedness 
dependence on key personnel may expose us to additional risks 
our business is dependent on the performance of certain key employees  including executive officers and senior operational personnel 
while we have entered into change of control agreements with some of our key executives  we do not enter into employment agreements with most of our key executive officers and senior operational personnel 
we also employ several on air personalities who have significant loyal audiences in their respective markets  with whom we have entered into employment agreements 
we cannot assure you that all such key personnel or on air personalities will remain with us or that our on air personalities will renew their contracts 
the loss of any key personnel could harm our operations and financial results 
failure of our information technology systems would disrupt our operations  which could reduce our customer base and result in lost revenue 
our computer systems are vulnerable to viruses  unauthorized tampering  system failures and potential obsolescence 
our operations depend on the continued and uninterrupted performance of our information technology systems 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers and computer systems are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
our computer systems are also subject to potential system failures and obsolescence 
any of these events could cause system interruption  delays and loss of critical data that would adversely affect our reputation and result in a loss of customers 
our recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities 
our ownership and operation of fisher plaza is subject to risks  including those relating to the economic climate  local real estate conditions  potential inability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  potential collection problems  reliance on significant tenants  and regulatory risks 
revenue and operating income from  and the value of  fisher plaza may be adversely affected by the general economic climate  the seattle economic climate and real estate conditions  including prospective tenants perceptions of the attractiveness of the property and the availability of space in other competing properties 
in addition  the economic conditions in the telecommunications and high tech sectors may significantly affect our ability to attract tenants to fisher plaza  because space at fisher plaza is marketed in significant part to organizations from these sectors 
other risks relating to the operation of fisher plaza include the potential inability to provide adequate management  maintenance and insurance  and the potential inability to collect rent  due to bankruptcy or insolvency of tenants or otherwise  especially in light of the current difficult economic environment 
we also risk facing lower rents due to the continuing uncertain economic conditions and abundance of available commercial space in downtown seattle 
real estate income and values may also be adversely affected by such factors as applicable laws and regulations  including tax and environmental laws  interest rate levels and the availability of financing 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rent loss insurance with respect to fisher plaza 
there are  however  certain losses that may be either uninsurable  not economically insurable  or in excess of our current insurance coverage limits 
if an uninsured loss occurs  it could harm our operating results 
we may experience volatility in the market price of our common stock due to the lower trading volume and lower public ownership of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to continue to be highly volatile 
in particular  the volatility of our shares is influenced by lower trading volume and lower public ownership relative to many of our publicly held competitors  as well as the recent turmoil in the stock market 
for example  our closing stock price has ranged from a high of per share to a low of per share during the period between january  and february  because several of our shareholders own significant portions of our outstanding shares  our stock is relatively less liquid and therefore more susceptible to large price fluctuations than many other companies shares 
if these shareholders were to sell all or a portion of their holdings of our common stock  the market price of our common stock could be negatively impacted 
the effect of such sales  or of significant portions of our stock being offered or made available for sale  could result in strong downward pressure on our stock price 
investors should be aware that they could experience significant short term volatility in our stock if such shareholders decide to sell all or a portion of their holdings of our common stock at once or within a short period of time 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  including without limitation  quarterly variations in operating results  announcements by us or our competitors  announcements relating to strategic decisions or key personnel  industry developments  service disruptions  acts of war  terrorism  or national calamities  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by security analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us  and news reports relating to trends in our markets or general economic conditions 
in addition  the stock market has recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
these fluctuations are often unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
when the market price of a company s stock drops significantly  shareholders often institute securities class action litigation against that company 
any litigation against us could cause us to incur substantial costs  divert the time and attention of our management and other resources or otherwise harm our business 
we are subject to the ongoing internal control provisions of section of the sarbanes oxley act of material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting  if identified in future periods  could indicate a lack of proper controls to generate accurate financial statements 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of and related sec rules  we are required to furnish a report of management s assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as part of our annual report on form k 
our independent registered public accountants are required to audit and provide a separate opinion on their evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting 
to issue our report  we document our internal control design and the testing processes that support our evaluation and conclusion  and then we test and evaluate the results 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to remediate material weaknesses  if any  that may be identified in future periods  or maintain all of the controls necessary for continued compliance 
we have in the past discovered  and may in the future discover  areas of our internal control over financial reporting that need improvement 
if we or our independent registered public accountants discover a material weakness  the disclosure of that fact  even if quickly remedied  could reduce the market s confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price 
we may not be able to effectively and timely implement necessary control changes and employee training to ensure continued compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and other regulatory and reporting requirements 
there likewise can be no assurance that we will be able to retain sufficient skilled finance and accounting personnel  especially in light of the increased demand for such personnel among publicly traded companies 
our operations may be adversely affected by earthquakes and other natural catastrophes in the pacific northwest or california 
our corporate headquarters  fisher plaza and the majority of our operations are located in the pacific northwest and we own two television stations in california 
the pacific northwest and california have from time to time experienced earthquakes 
we do not know the ultimate impact on our operations of being located near major earthquake faults  but an earthquake could harm our operating results 
our broadcasting towers may also be affected by other natural catastrophes  such as forest fires 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover the losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes or other natural catastrophes 
we could be negatively affected as a result of a currently threatened proxy fight 
in january  a dissident shareholder declared its intention to nominate four individuals for election to our board of directors at the annual meeting of shareholders 
a proxy contest could negatively affect us because responding to proxy contests and other actions by dissident shareholders can be costly and time consuming  disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of management and our employees  perceived uncertainties as to our future direction may impact our existing and potential strategic and operational relationships and opportunities and may make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel  if individuals are elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda  it may adversely affect our ability to effectively and timely implement our current business plan which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition  and a proxy contest could cause our stock price to experience periods of volatility

you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which are based on our current expectations and projections about future events  are not guarantees of future performance  are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions including those described herein and apply only as of the date of this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in the section entitled risk factors as well as those discussed in this section and elsewhere in this annual report 
this discussion is intended to provide an analysis of significant trends and material changes in our financial condition and operating results during the period from through overview we are an integrated media company 
we own and operate full power including a owned television station and seven low power television stations and ten owned or managed radio stations 
our television stations are located in washington  oregon  idaho and california  and our radio stations are located in washington and montana 
we also own and operate fisher plaza  a mixed use commercial facility located near downtown seattle that serves as the home for our corporate offices and our seattle television and radio stations 
we lease a majority of the space at fisher plaza to a variety of unaffiliated companies 
our broadcasting operations receive revenue from the sale of local  regional and national advertising and  to a much lesser extent  from retransmission consent fees  tower rental and commercial production activities 
our operating results are  therefore  sensitive to broad economic trends that affect the broadcasting industry in general  as well as local and regional trends  particularly those affecting the pacific northwest economy 
the advertising revenue of our stations is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year  due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring  and retail advertising in the period leading up to and including the holiday season 
in addition  advertising revenue is generally higher during national election years due to spending by political candidates and advocacy groups 
this political spending typically is heaviest during the fourth quarter 
our television revenue is significantly affected by network affiliation and the success of programming offered by those networks 
our two largest television stations  komo tv and katu tv  accounted for approximately percent of our television broadcasting revenue in and are affiliated with the abc television network 
we have twelve television stations which are affiliated with one of the four major networks 
six of our television stations are affiliated with univision spanish language and the remainder of our television stations are independent or subscribe to various programming services

our affiliation agreement with univision expires in september the non renewal of any of our major network affiliation agreements could adversely affect our business and results 
our broadcasting operations are subject to competitive pressures from traditional broadcasting sources  as well as from alternative methods of delivering information and entertainment  and these pressures may cause fluctuations in operating results 
in addition to our broadcasting operations  we own and operate fisher plaza  and we lease space to other companies that are attracted by the property location and the infrastructure provided at this facility 
at december   approximately of fisher plaza was occupied or committed for occupancy occupied by fisher entities  compared to occupied or committed for occupancy at december  occupied by fisher entities 
revenue and operating income from fisher plaza are dependent upon the general economic climate  the seattle economic climate  the outlook of the telecommunications and technology sectors and commercial real estate conditions  including the availability of space in other competing properties

the acquisition contributed million in additional television revenue for the year ended december  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates including  but not limited to  those affecting revenues  goodwill and intangibles impairment  the useful lives of tangible and intangible assets  valuation allowances for receivables and broadcast rights  stock based compensation expense  valuation allowances for deferred income taxes and liabilities and contingencies 
the brief discussion below is intended to highlight some of the judgments and uncertainties that can impact the application of these policies and the specific dollar amounts reported on our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
many of our estimates or judgments are based on anticipated future events or performance  and as such are forward looking in nature  and are subject to many risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report 
except as otherwise required by law  we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this discussion to reflect any future events or circumstances 
we have identified below our accounting policies that we consider critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this is not a complete list of all of our accounting policies  and there may be other accounting policies that are significant to us 
for a detailed discussion of the application of these and our other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them  as presented in this annual report 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of purchase price of certain media properties over the fair value of acquired tangible and identifiable intangible net assets 
indefinite lived intangible assets consist of certain television licenses primarily fcc licenses 
in making estimates of fair values for the purposes of allocating the purchase price  we rely primarily on our extensive knowledge of the market and  if considered appropriate  will obtain valuations from independent third party specialists 
in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired  we consider information obtained as a result of pre acquisition due diligence  including third party reports that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective assets 
we evaluate the potential for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually  or whenever events indicate that an impairment may exist 
if the fair value of these assets is less than the carrying value  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
the goodwill impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units with the carrying amounts of net assets  including goodwill  related to each reporting unit 
if the carrying amount exceeds a reporting unit s fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the impairment loss is measured based on the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill in the reporting unit being tested 
fair values are determined based on valuations that rely primarily on the discounted cash flow method and market multiples of current earnings 
this method uses future projections of cash flows from each of our reporting units and includes  among other estimates  projections of future advertising revenue and operating expenses  market supply and demand  projected capital spending and an assumption of our weighted average cost of capital  as adjusted for market participant data 
our indefinite lived assets broadcast licenses  which are not subject to amortization  are tested for impairment at least on an annual basis by applying a fair value based test as required 
our evaluations of fair values include analyses based on the estimated future cash flows generated by the underlying assets  estimated trends  and other relevant determinants of fair value for these assets 
if the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and its carrying value 
changes in any of these estimates  projections and assumptions could have a material effect on the fair value of these assets in future measurement periods and result in an impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles which could materially affect our results of operations 
the impairment test for fcc licenses consists of a station by station comparison of the carrying amount of fcc licenses with their fair value  using a discounted cash flow analysis 
we believe our estimate of the value of our goodwill and broadcasting licenses is a critical accounting estimate as the value is significant in relation to our total assets  and our estimate of the value uses assumptions that incorporate variables based on past experiences and judgments about future performance of our stations 
tangible long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived tangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
we use our judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment analysis is necessary 
factors we consider which could trigger an impairment analysis include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results  a significant decrease in the market value of an asset  a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or significant negative cash flows or industry trends 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value  which is primarily based on market transactions for comparable businesses  discounted cash flows and a review of the underlying assets of the reporting unit 
in estimating future cash flows  we use future projections of cash flows directly associated with  and that were expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of the assets 
these projections rely on significant assumptions 
if it is determined that a long lived asset is not recoverable  an impairment loss would be calculated based on the excess of the carrying amount of the long lived asset over its fair value 
changes in any of our estimates could have a material effect on the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset and could result in a future impairment of the involved assets with a material effect on our future results of operations 
television and radio broadcast rights 
television and radio broadcast rights are recorded as assets when the license period begins and the programs are available for broadcast  at the gross amount of the related obligations or  for non sports first run programming  at the amount of the annual obligation 
costs incurred in connection with the purchase of programs to be broadcast within one year are classified as current assets  while costs of those programs to be broadcast after one year are considered non current 
these programming costs are charged to operations over their estimated broadcast periods using the straight line method 
program obligations are classified as current or non current in accordance with the payment terms of the license agreement 
revenue recognition 
television and radio revenue is recognized  net of advertising agency commissions  when the advertisement is broadcast  subject to meeting certain conditions such as persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
these criteria are generally met at the time an advertisement is broadcast  and the revenue is recorded net of advertising agency commission 
we may trade certain advertising time for products or services  as well as barter advertising time for program material 
trade transactions are generally reported at the estimated fair value of the product or service received  while barter transactions are reported at management s estimate of the value of the advertising time exchanged  which approximates the fair value of the program material received 
revenue is reported on trade and barter transactions when commercials are broadcast and expenses are reported when products or services are utilized or when programming airs 
we receive consideration from certain satellite  cable and wireless providers in return for consent to the retransmission of the signals of our television stations 
revenue from production of broadcast media content is recognized when a contracted production is available for distribution 
revenues from retransmission consent and satellite transmission services are recognized when the service is performed 
website advertising revenue is recognized as services are delivered 
rentals from real estate leases are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  while revenue from related service fees is recognized when the services are delivered 
accrued retirement benefits 
we maintain a noncontributory supplemental retirement program that was established for key management 
no new participants have been admitted to this program since and the benefits of active participants were frozen in the program participants do not include any of our current executive officers 
the program provides for vesting of benefits under certain circumstances 
funding is not required  but we have made investments in annuity contracts and maintain life insurance policies on the lives of the individual participants to assist in our payment of retirement benefits 
we are the owner and beneficiary of the annuity contracts and life insurance policies 
accordingly  the cash value of the annuity contracts and the cash surrender value of the life insurance policies are reported in the consolidated balance sheet 
the supplemental retirement program requires continued employment or disability through the date of expected retirement 
the cost of the program is recognized over the participants average expected future lifetime 
the cost of this program is reported and accounted for in accordance with accounting rules that require significant assumptions regarding such factors as discount rates 
we use an independent actuarial consulting firm to assist in estimating the supplemental retirement obligation and related periodic expenses 
the discount rate used in determining the actuarial present value of the projected benefit obligation was at december  and at december  the rate of increase in future compensation was no longer applicable at december  or due to freezing plan benefits for active participants 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable for these key actuarial assumptions  future actual results could differ from our estimates 
changes in benefits provided by us may also affect future plan costs 
income taxes 
the preparation of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
these estimates and judgments must be used in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities because of differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
in assessing whether  and to what extent  deferred tax assets can be realized  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover some or all our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration and are required to establish valuation allowances against that portion of our deferred tax assets not considered recoverable 
the determination of required valuation allowances involves significant judgment and is based upon our best estimate of anticipated taxable profits in various jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated 
changes in expectations and actual future results could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowances and material changes to our provision for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
at december   we have not recorded a valuation allowance on our federal deferred tax assets as management believes that it is more likely than not that our federal deferred tax assets are realizable 
the amount of net deferred tax assets considered realizable  however  could be reduced in the future if our projections of future taxable income are reduced or if we do not perform at the levels we are projecting 
this could result in the need to establish a valuation allowance for our federal deferred tax assets 
due to the uncertainty of our ability to generate sufficient state taxable income to realize our deferred state tax assets  we have established a valuation allowance for financial reporting purposes 
the valuation allowance was million at december  and our federal and state income tax returns are subject to periodic examination and the tax authorities may challenge certain of our tax positions as a result of examinations 
we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we would vigorously defend these positions if challenged 
the final disposition of any positions challenged by the tax authorities could require us to make additional tax payments 
the application of income tax law is inherently complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are sometimes ambiguous 
as such  we are required to make certain subjective assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
accordingly  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets and statements of operations 
we believe that we have appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on our tax returns and that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors  including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded for the years ended december  and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific reserve to reduce the amounts recorded to what we believe will be collected 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on factors such as the level of past due balances for each business unit  as well as changes in current economic conditions 
variable interest entities 
we may enter into jsas or lmas with non owned stations 
under the terms of these agreements  we make specific periodic payments to the station s owner operator in exchange for the right to provide programming and or sell advertising on a portion of the station s broadcast time 
nevertheless  the owner operator retains control and responsibility for the operation of the station  including responsibility over all programming broadcast on the station 
generally  we continue to operate the station and sell advertising under the lma agreement and sell advertising under the jsa agreement until the termination of such agreement 
as a result of these agreements  we may determine that the station is a variable interest entity vie and that we are the primary beneficiary of the variable interest 
this typically occurs if we also have an agreement to acquire a station and the conditions to close are considered to be perfunctory 
we also may determine that a station is a vie in connection with other types of local service agreements entered into with stations in markets in which we own and operate a station 
stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards 
our estimation of the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price  as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected life of the award  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the award  forfeitures and projected exercise behaviors 
the black scholes option pricing model requires the input of subjective assumptions and other reasonable assumptions could provide differing results 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings regarding contractual and employment relationships and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when a loss is assessed to be probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
assessing probability of loss and estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  including in some cases judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
consolidated results of operations we report financial data for three reportable segments television  radio and fisher plaza 
the television segment includes the operations of our owned and operated television stations including a owned television station and internet business

broadcasting revenue increased primarily due to the robust political spending in california  washington and oregon and the continued economic recovery in our markets  which lead to improvements in some of our key sectors  including automotive and retail 
we also experienced higher than normal political advertising revenue in  in light of the recent united states supreme court decision in citizens united v 
fec in which the court struck down federal laws banning independent electoral and issue advocacy sponsored by nonprofit and for profit corporations 
political spending was also positively affected by the competitive races and robust initiatives in our markets

many of these costs are relatively fixed in nature and do not necessarily vary on a proportional basis with revenue 
television 
the increase in direct operating costs of million  or  for the television segment in as compared to was primarily the result of an increase in our network programming costs  an increase in news rating services and an increase in our compensation costs 
the increase in compensation costs was primarily due to increases in personal services contracts and union rates  state unemployment rates and employee benefits 
the decrease in direct operating costs of million  or  for the television segment in as compared to was primarily the result of a reduction in personnel and associated compensation costs and benefits  plus a reduction in promotional spending

the decrease in direct operating costs of  or  at fisher plaza in as compared to was primarily attributable to decreased management costs and repair and maintenance expenditures 
other 
the other category consists primarily of the reclassification and elimination of certain operating expenses between operating segments

there was no amortization of program rights related to the mariners agreement in or impairment of goodwill and intangible assets based on our annual impairment analysis as of october   we determined that it was not necessary to record an impairment charge because the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units is greater than the carrying value 
the individual carrying value of one reporting unit is within of its estimated fair value 
the aggregate carrying value of goodwill at this reporting unit was million at december  we recorded an impairment charge of million during the fourth quarter of that included a million impairment to the carrying values of fcc licenses  related to five of our television stations and two of our radio stations  a  impairment to the carrying value of a network affiliation agreement for one of our television stations  and a million impairment to the carrying values of goodwill  related to six reporting units consisting of eleven of our television stations and five of our radio stations 
we tested our fcc licenses and goodwill for impairment at december   between the annual impairment tests  because we believed events had occurred and circumstances changed that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts and that our fcc licenses might be impaired 
these events included a decline in the price of our common stock as of december   the deterioration of overall economic conditions  and the decline in advertising revenues at our radio and television stations

recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update to authoritative guidance on consolidation 
this update addresses the effects on certain provisions of previous accounting guidance related to the consolidation of variable interest entities as a result of the elimination of the qualifying special purpose entity concept and concerns about the application of certain key provisions of consolidation guidance  including those in which the accounting and disclosures under the standard do not always provide timely and useful information about an enterprise s involvement in a variable interest entity 
this update was effective january  based on the updated authoritative guidance discussed above  we determined it was appropriate to consolidate our investment in southwest oregon broadcasting corporation 
we own of the outstanding stock of southwest oregon broadcasting corporation  licensee of a television station in roseburg  oregon for which we serve as the manager 
the consolidation of this equity investment did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the market risk in our consolidated financial instruments represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in financial rates 
we are currently exposed to market risk in the areas of interest rates 
this exposure is directly related to our normal funding activities 
interest rate exposure the aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due is at a fixed rate 
the fair market value of long term fixed interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally  the fair market value of fixed interest rate debt will increase as interest rates fall and decrease as interest rates rise 
as of december   our fixed rate debt totaled million 
the estimated fair value of our long term debt at december  was approximately million  which was approximately million more than its carrying value 
market risk is estimated as the potential change in fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates and  as of december   amounted to approximately million 
fair market values are determined based on market quotes by brokers 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes do not impact book value  operations  or cash flows
