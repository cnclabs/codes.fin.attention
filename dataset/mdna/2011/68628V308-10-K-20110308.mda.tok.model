ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap as measures of operating performance  liquidity or ability to service debt obligations 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies

unless the context requires otherwise  when we refer to we  us and our  we are describing orion marine group  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
overview we are a leading marine specialty contractor serving the heavy civil marine infrastructure market 
we provide a broad range of marine construction and specialty services on  over and under the water along the gulf coast  the atlantic seaboard  the pacific northwest and the caribbean basin 
our customers include federal  state and municipal governments  the combination of which accounted for approximately of our revenue in the year ended december   as well as private commercial and industrial enterprises 
we are headquartered in houston  texas 
recap and outlook in january  we acquired texas based tw laquay dredging  llc twld for approximately million in cash  utilizing proceeds raised in our august public stock offering to fund the acquisition 
the acquisition provided us with additional dredging resources for deep channel dredging capability as well as additional experienced personnel 
through its backlog  the acquisition immediately contributed to revenue 
in february  we expanded our operations and established a base in the pacific northwest through the purchase of a marine construction business  at a total price of million in cash 
as the fair value of the business purchased exceeded the purchase price  we recognized a gain  net of the associated tax effect  of million on this transaction 
despite a difficult and challenging economic environment and increased competition along the eastern seaboard  our revenues increased in as compared with  including the liquidation of the twld backlog 
the mix of contracts in progress and those completed during shifted more toward the public sector  with of revenue generated from state agencies and local municipalities  as well as the federal government  which includes the us army corps of engineers 
we are not dependent upon a single sector as a source of revenue 
we continued to invest in specialized equipment to enhance our lift capabilities and expand our fleet 
our capital expenditures in totaled million  excluding the assets acquired in our two acquisitions 
in june  we entered into a larger credit facility  which provides for a revolving credit line of up to million  with an additional million available at the lender s discretion 
our credit facility extends to june  during the year ended december   our operations provided cash from operations of million and our cash position at december  exceeded million 
our operations are not currently dependent on external sources of capital and we have not utilized the million available to us under our revolving credit facility 
our overall performance generally depends on spending in the heavy civil marine infrastructure market 
spending by our customers  both government and private  is impacted by several important trends affecting our industry  including the following port and channel expansion and maintenance  deteriorating condition of intracoastal waterways and bridges  continued demand in the cruise industry  infrastructure spending by the united states navy and coast guard  near shore oil and gas capital expenditures ongoing us coastal wetlands restoration and reclamation  recurring hurricane restoration and repair 
despite the uncertain economic and political environments  we continue to see positive long term trends in our end markets  including ports in our geographic markets have released plans for expansion as a result of recent cargo volume increases and expected future increases as larger ships begin to transit the panama canal  good opportunities for coastal restoration and protection projects  and 
the continuation of the highway transportation program for highway construction  including bridges over water 
our focus in will be to concentrate on our core business objectives  to manage our business effectively and efficiently  while maintaining pricing discipline  to pursue rational growth strategies while closely monitoring the costs of our operations  and to maintain our strong balance sheet 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements contained in this report were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect both the company s carrying values of its assets and liabilities  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
although our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into construction contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  most are made on a fixed price basis 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method 
the percentage of completion method measures the ratio of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
this requires us to prepare on going estimates of the costs to complete each contract as the project progresses 
in preparing these estimates  we make significant judgments and assumptions concerning our significant cost drivers of materials  labor and equipment  and we evaluate contingencies based on possible schedule variances  production delays or other productivity factors 
actual costs may vary from the costs we estimated 
variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in fixed price contracts may result in actual revenue and gross profits differing from those we estimated and could result in losses on projects 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined  without regard to the percentage of completion 
we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change  but not for price associated with that scope change 
these costs are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred 
we recognize revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved change orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated amount is equal to or greater than our cost related to the unapproved change order and the related margin when the change order is formally approved by the customer 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in contract costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts on the balance sheet 
we consider claims to be amounts that we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer caused changes in contract specifications or design  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes 
revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims  which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract 
costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred 
depending on the size of a particular project  variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
we believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts is limited by the relatively short duration of the contracts we undertake and our management s experience in estimating contract costs 
long lived assets our long lived assets consist primarily of equipment used in our operations 
fixed assets are carried at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from one to thirty years  using the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax reporting purposes 
the carrying value of our long lived assets is evaluated periodically based on utilization of the asset and physical condition of the asset  as well as the useful life of the asset to determine if adjustment to the depreciation period or the carrying value is warranted 
if events and circumstances such as poor utilization or deteriorated physical condition indicate that the asset s should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows  including disposition  on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of those assets to determine if an impairment exists 
if we identify a potential impairment  we will estimate the fair value of the asset through known market transactions of similar equipment and other valuation techniques  which could include the use of similar projections on a discounted basis 
we will report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair values 
goodwill we have acquired businesses and assets in purchase transactions that resulted in the recognition of goodwill 
in accordance with us gaap  acquired goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset more likely than not may be impaired 
goodwill recorded on our consolidated balance sheets is subject to impairment testing at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the asset more likely than not may be impaired 
we evaluate goodwill at the reporting unit level 
we have determined that we have three reporting units  which are based on geography  and are referred to internally as east coast  gulf coast and pacific northwest 
each reporting unit conducts similar business as described in this annual report on form k  which includes marine construction specialty services 
this reporting unit grouping reflects our internal management structure  which is based on the geographic location of our primary field offices 
two reporting units  gulf coast and east coast have goodwill and are tested for impairment 
at december   goodwill totaled million  of which million related to the gulf coast including goodwill acquired from the acquisition of tw laquay  and million resulted from the acquisition of equipment on the east coast in we assess the fair value of our two reporting units based on a weighted average of valuations based on market multiples  discounted cash flows  and consideration of our market capitalization 
the key assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuations are discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to cash flow projections 
also inherent in the discounted cash flow valuation models are past performance  projections and assumptions in current operating plans  and revenue growth rates over the next five years 
these assumptions contemplate business  market and overall economic conditions 
we also consider assumptions that market participants may use 
as required by the company s policy  annual impairment tests of goodwill are performed during the fourth quarter of each year or when circumstances arise that indicate a possible impairment might exist 
based on this testing  we determined that the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values as of october   goodwill was not impaired  and no events have occurred since that date that would require an interim impairment test 
in the future  our estimated fair value could be negatively impacted by deteriorating economic conditions  which may reduce our revenue growth potential 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the liability method prescribed by us gaap 
we evaluate valuation allowances for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain 
the estimation of required valuation allowance includes estimates of future taxable income 
in our assessment of our deferred tax assets at december   we considered that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions asc  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on our consolidated tax return 
we evaluate and record any uncertain tax positions based on the amount that management deems is more likely than not to be sustained upon ultimate settlement with the tax authorities in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
insurance coverage  litigation  claims and contingencies we maintain insurance coverage for our business and operations 
insurance related to property  equipment  automobile  general liability and a portion of workers compensation is provided through traditional policies  subject to a deductible 
a portion of our workers compensation exposure is covered through a mutual association  which is subject to supplemental calls 
the company maintains five levels of excess loss insurance coverage  totaling million in excess of primary coverage  which excess loss coverage responds to all of the company s insurance policies other than a portion of its workers compensation coverage and employee health care coverage 
the company s excess loss coverage responds to most of its policies when a primary limit of million has been exhausted  provided that the primary limit for maritime employer s liability is million and the watercraft pollution policy primary limit is million 
we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles  limits and retentions under our insurance programs 
losses on these policies up to the deductible amounts are accrued in our consolidated financial statements based on known claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
we derive our accruals from known facts  historical trends and industry averages to determine the best estimate of the ultimate expected loss 
actual claims may vary from our estimate 
we include any adjustments to such reserves in our consolidated results of operations in the period in which they become known 
accounting for stock issued to employees and others we measure the cost of equity compensation to our employees and independent directors based on the estimated grant date fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the fair value of the awards of equity instruments 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in the computation 
changes in these assumptions can cause significant fluctuations in the fair value of the option award 
consolidated results of operations current year year ended december  compared with year ended december  the following information is derived from our historical results of operations dollars in thousands twelve months ended december  amount percent amount percent contract revenues cost of contract revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income other income expense gain from bargain purchase interest income interest expense other income expense  net income before income taxes income tax expense net income contract revenues 
total revenue in increased million or  as compared with  of which approximately million related to liquidation of backlog from contracts acquired in the acquisition of tw laquay dredging 
the assets of tw laquay dredging were absorbed into the normal operations of our business and are not a separate reporting unit 
the remaining increase in revenue was attributable to the size and type of projects in backlog  the productivity of our labor force  the utilization of our equipment and the progress schedules in the mix of projects between periods  all of which factor into and affect the rate at which revenue is recognized as projects are completed 
our typical project duration is between three to nine months  and comparisons of individual projects between reporting periods are not indicators of future results 
in  our mix of contracts due to the projects we chose to bid and were awarded  as well as the backlog obtained from tw laquay dredging shifted  such that of revenues were generated from federally funded projects 
overall  of revenues were generated from governmentally funded projects  with generated from the private sector 
our customer base changes over time  and we are not dependent on a single sector or customer for the projects we bid 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or as compared with the prior year  primarily as a result of the increase in revenues 
however  gross margin decreased in to of revenues from of revenues in the decrease was due to pricing pressure experienced on the east coast which reduced profitability on certain jobs throughout the year 
in the fourth quarter  production issues on three projects negatively impacted gross profit and margin 
in addition  the mix of contracts in progress required the use of outside subcontractors  more than is historically our norm  which reduced our overall self performance rate to and contributed to the decrease in gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expense 
as compared with the prior year  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased approximately million or in in the current year  million was related to the costs of the acquisitions in early  while in approximately million was related to the amortization of construction contracts in backlog acquired in upon the acquisition of a dredging business along the eastern seaboard 
excluding these two items in each year  sg a increased by approximately million  primarily related to additional overheads to support our business growth 
other income  net of expense 
other income of million in resulted from a gain of million on the purchase of the business in the pacific northwest in february  which fair value  net of the related deferred tax liability  exceeded the purchase price 
the balance related to interest expense  net of interest income 
income tax expense 
our effective rate for the year ended december  was 
this differed from the company s statutory rate of primarily due to state income taxes and the non deductibility of certain permanent tax items  such as incentive stock compensation expense  and which in the current year included a reduction of taxable income related to the net gain on the bargain purchase of the business in the pacific northwest

total revenue in increased million or  as compared with the increase in revenue was attributable to the progress schedules and rate of completion of the contracts in progress in our mix of projects during the year shifted toward the public sector  which totaled of revenues  with revenues generated from the private sector representing 
in  of revenues were generated from government agencies and from the private sector 
an increase in spending by the corps of engineers  partly targeting economic recovery  resulted in of total revenues generated from federally funded projects  as compared with in the prior year 
gross profit 
gross profit increased by million  or and gross margin improved to in from in we achieved an improvement in gross margin related to the increase in revenues despite a reduction in our contract self performance rate to of total costs  as compared with a self performance rate of in in addition  during  significant production delays which resulted from unexpected amounts of trash and unforeseen site conditions on two projects involving dredging services  negatively affected gross margins in that period  and which did not reoccur in selling  general and administrative expense 
as compared with the prior year  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million or in the increase was due primarily to additional overheads to support our business growth 
in the prior year  we benefitted from lower group medical and workers compensation expenses 
income tax expense 
our effective rate for the year ended december  was and differed from the company s statutory rate of primarily related to state income taxes and the non deductibility of certain permanent tax items  such as incentive stock compensation expense  offset in part by the benefit of the domestic production activities deduction on our federal tax return  which net effect increased our overall effective tax rate 
our effective tax rate of in differed from our statutory rate of  primarily due to the benefit of the domestic production activities deduction on the company s tax return and true ups of federal and state deferred taxes 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are for financing working capital  investment in capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions 
historically  our sources of liquidity have been cash provided by our operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
our working capital position fluctuates from period to period due to normal increases and decreases in operations activity 
at december   our working capital was million as compared with million at december   of which million in the prior year balance was related to the proceeds received from the sale of common stock in august as of december   we had available cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility of million 
during  our operations provided cash from operations of million 
our operations are not currently dependent on external sources of capital  and we have not utilized our available borrowing of million under our credit facility 
we expect to meet our future internal liquidity and working capital needs  and maintain our equipment fleet through capital expenditure purchases and major repairs  from funds generated in our operating activities  and from the proceeds received from our common stock offering  for at least the next months 
we believe our cash position  combined with the capacity available under our revolving credit facility  is adequate for our general business requirements 
the following table provides information regarding our cash flows and our capital expenditures for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above operating activities 
fluctuations in cash generated by operating activities are generally the result of timing differences related to the nature and volume of contracts in any given year 
our operations provided net cash of million during fiscal the change between periods of million  as compared with was due to an increase in our deferred income taxes of million due to an increase in deferred tax liability related to timing differences in book and tax depreciation resulting from the acquisitions in the year  an increase of million of depreciation expense related to the increase in our fleet  an increase of million of stock based compensation expense  due to the increase in the fair value of our stock at the time of grants  offset by a decrease of million in working capital components  as described below 
in  the changes in working capital included a decrease in trade payables of million compared with  related to the timing of payments to vendors  and based on the mix of contracts in progress 
amounts unbilled to customers  net of our liability related to progress billings  increased by million as compared with and was related to the timing of billings to customers and our contractual ability to bill for materials received but not installed 
due to the timing of estimated federal income tax deposits  our prepaid taxes increased by approximately million  and we recorded a receivable of approximately million related to the finalization of the purchase price of tw laquay dredging 
we manage our working capital components in total  rather than by the individual elements  and fluctuations in accounts receivable and payable balances are normal within our business 
in  our accounts receivable and payable balances increased by million and million  respectively  and amounts unbilled to customers exceeded billings to customers on our contracts in progress 
investing activities 
we purchase capital equipment as well as perform major maintenance and upgrades of our existing fleet and construction equipment to support our construction activities 
capital expenditures supporting our operations and enhancing our fleet totaled million in  an increase of million as compared with  some of which related to the purchase of additional heavy lift capacity 
also in  we acquired the business of tw laquay dredging for approximately million  and expanded into the pacific northwest through a business acquisition totaling million 
in  our capital expenditures totaled million  which included the purchase of specialized equipment for approximately million 
in  we purchased assets to expand our dredging capabilities along the atlantic seaboard for a total purchase price of million 
proceeds from the sale of property and equipment in included million received from the sale of a vessel no longer considered integral to our fleet 
financing activities 
financing activities in primarily related to loan costs incurred upon the entry into a new credit agreement in june and to proceeds received from the exercise of stock options 
in august  we completed a public offering of common stock  receiving proceeds  net of expenses  of approximately million 
with a portion of the proceeds  we repaid the outstanding balance on our credit facility 
in addition  we received proceeds from stock option exercises  including related tax benefits of million 
cash provided by financing activities in was attributable to our borrowing of million under our line of credit to fund the purchase of assets 
sources of capital on june   the company entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association  as administrative agent  and wells fargo securities  llc as sole lead arranger and bookrunner  and the lenders from time to time as party thereto 
the credit agreement provides for borrowings of up to  under revolving and swingline loans as defined in the credit agreement with a  sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit 
an additional million is available under the facility subject to the lenders discretion together  the credit facility 
the credit facility matures on september   and is guaranteed by the subsidiaries of the company 
the credit facility may be used to finance working capital  repay indebtedness  fund acquisitions  and for other general corporate purposes 
revolving loans may be designated as prime rate based loans abr loans or eurodollar loans  at the company s request  and may be made in integrals of  in the case of an abr loan  or  in the case of a eurodollar loan 
swingline loans may only be designated as abr loans  and may be made in amounts equal to integral multiples of  the company may convert  change or modify such designations from time to time 
interest is computed based on the designation of the loans  and bear interest at either a prime based interest rate or a libor based interest rate 
principal balances drawn under the credit facility may be prepaid at any time  in whole or in part  without premium or penalty 
amounts repaid under the credit facility may be re borrowed 
the credit facility contains certain restrictive financial covenants that are usual and customary for similar transactions  including  a fixed charge coverage ratio of not less than to at all times  a leverage ratio of not greater than to at all times  a minimum net worth of not less than million on the effective date  and at the end of each fiscal quarter thereafter  minimum net worth required as of the end of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter plus of the borrower s and its subsidiaries consolidated net income for that quarter  plus of all issuances of equity interests by borrower during that quarter 
in addition  the credit facility contains events of default that are usual and customary for similar transactions  including non payment of principal  interest or fees  inaccuracy of representations and warranties  violation of covenants  bankruptcy and insolvency events  and events constituting a change of control 
the company is subject to a commitment fee  payable quarterly in arrears on the unused portion of the credit facility at a current rate of of the unused balance 
as of december   no amounts had been drawn under the credit facility 
at december   the company was in compliance with all its financial covenants with a sufficient margin as to not impair its ability to incur additional debt or violate the terms of the credit facility  and had outstanding letters of credit of  historically  the company has not relied on debt financing to fund its operations or working capital 
bonding capacity we are generally required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide additional security to our customers for our performance under certain government and private sector contracts 
our ability to obtain surety bonds depends on our capitalization  working capital  past performance and external factors  including the capacity of the overall surety market 
at december   we believe our capacity under our current bonding arrangement was in excess of million  of which we had approximately million in surety bonds outstanding 
we believe our strong balance sheet and working capital position will allow us to continue to access our bonding capacity 
effect of inflation we are subject to the effects of inflation through increases in the cost of raw materials  and other items such as fuel 
because the typical duration of a project is between three to nine months we do not believe inflation has had a material impact on our operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently have no off balance sheet arrangements  other than operating leases to which we are a party  and which are discussed above under bonding capacity and sources of capital and which arise in the normal course of business 
these arrangements are not reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial condition  or results of operations that is material to investors 
see note commitments and contingencies of notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  payment due by period total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total commitments pursuant to other purchase orders and subcontracts related to construction contracts are not included since such amounts are expected to be funded under contract billings 
to manage risks of changes in the material prices and subcontracting costs used in tendering bids for construction contracts  we obtain firm quotations from our suppliers and subcontractors before submitting a bid 
these quotations do not include any quantity guarantees  and we have no obligation for materials or subcontract services beyond those required to complete the contracts that we are awarded for which quotations have been provided 
recently issued accounting pronouncements disclosures about fair value measurements in january  the fasb issued a new accounting standard update asu which clarifies and provides additional disclosure requirements on the transfers of assets and liabilities between level quoted prices in active market for identical assets or liabilities and level significant other observable inputs of the fair value measurement hierarchy  including the reasons for and the timing of the transfers 
additionally  the guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases  sales  issuance  and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs level fair value measurements 
this asu is effective for us in  except for the requirements to provide level activity which will become effective for us in the adoption of the currently effective provisions of this asu did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements  and we do not expect the adoption of the remaining provisions of this asu to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
during the periods presented in these financial statements  the company implemented other new accounting pronouncements other than the one above that are discussed in the notes where applicable 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading  speculation or other purposes that would expose the company to market risk 
in the normal course of business  our results of operations are subject to risks related to fluctuation in commodity prices and fluctuations in interest rates 
commodity price risk we are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices for concrete  steel products and fuel 
although we attempt to secure firm quotes from our suppliers  we generally do not hedge against increases in prices for concrete  steel and fuel 
commodity price risks may have an impact on our results of operations due to the fixed price nature of many of our contracts  although the short term duration of our projects may allow us to include price increases in the costs of our bids 
interest rate risk at december   we had no borrowings under our credit agreement 
interest expense interest related primarily to the amortization of costs associated with the entry into the credit facility in june 
our credit facility expires in june our objectives in managing interest rate risk are to lower our overall borrowing costs and limit interest rate changes on our earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this  we closely monitor changes in interest rates and we utilize cash from operations to reduce our debt position
