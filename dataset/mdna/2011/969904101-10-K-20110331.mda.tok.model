each of our brands ended the year stronger than it began  and aggressive and proactive initiatives across the organization led to new milestones in profitability

retail net revenues in fiscal increased by  or  compared to fiscal this increase was driven by growth of in comparable store sales  partially offset by a year over year reduction in retail leased square footage  including net fewer stores 
increased net revenues during fiscal were driven by the pottery barn  west elm and williams sonoma brands 
in our core brands  net revenues increased compared to fiscal led by growth in the pottery barn brand 
sales trends improved in every concept and we saw significant growth in new customer acquisition 
in our emerging brands  net revenues increased led by west elm and pbteen  which continued to see net revenue and operating margin increases 
in williams sonoma home  we completed the retail restructuring of the brand by closing all stand alone retail stores 
fiscal operational results in our supply chain  we continued to see ongoing customer service and cost reduction benefits from our distribution  transportation  packaging  and quality returns initiatives 
these initiatives included implementing the first phase of our multi year east coast distribution center consolidation  optimizing our inbound and outbound packaging  improving efficiency in our personalization operations  and consolidating shipments of customers furniture and non furniture orders into one delivery 
another significant supply chain initiative was asian sourcing where we expanded our in country operations 
this initiative has allowed us to establish factory specific expertise  improve vendor performance and reduce returns  replacements and damages 
we are gaining similar efficiencies from the expansion of our north carolina upholstered furniture operation  which is now a major supplier of our upholstered furniture 
in information technology  we made significant progress in e commerce  particularly in the areas of on site search  customer engagement  mobile and social media 
all of these investments drove increased traffic  higher conversion and a superior on site experience for our customers 
we also launched new e gift card functionality in all brands and a new member based shipping program in the williams sonoma brand 
in direct marketing  we implemented new functionality that allowed us to make significant advancements in the relevance of our e marketing programs 

table of contents in real estate  for the second consecutive year  we successfully reduced our retail occupancy costs and closed an additional stores  or of our retail leased square footage 
in business development  global expansion was a key focus for us this year as we opened our first six franchised stores in dubai and kuwait

h 
alshaya 
together  we are expecting to open additional stores in this region  including seven in fiscal we are also in the preliminary exploration phase for retail expansion in other parts of the world  with a goal to open in new regions in fiscal fiscal as we look forward to  our focus is on gaining market share and improving profitability 
to gain market share  we will continue to attract new customers to our brands through creative  innovative and relevant product offerings  including exclusive internet assortments  increased investment in e commerce  highly targeted multi channel marketing  including the expansion of our in store clienteling services  and the expansion of our brands into new categories  new markets and new geographies  including the rollout of international shipping in the back half of the year 
the internet is our fastest growing channel and a key component of our future strategy 
we have a longstanding direct to customer heritage  a rich house file and an expansive digital asset portfolio 
as such  we are planning to increase our internet investments in fiscal to capitalize on the significant opportunity we see ahead 
the internet has changed the way our customers shop and the on line brand experience has to be inspiring and seamless 
our customer service initiatives are also a key focus this year as we expand our clienteling services and in store event programs 
we believe the customer experience  whether on line or in our retail stores  is a significant brand differentiator and these initiatives are engaging new customers in our brands  while at the same time allowing us to take our existing customer relationships to new levels 
to improve profitability in fiscal  we plan to implement new efficiencies in our worldwide supply chain  drive increased traffic and higher sales per square foot in our retail stores by reinventing the customer experience  and continue to expand e commerce 
e commerce is not only our fastest growing but also our most profitable channel and  therefore  its growth as a percentage of total company revenues increases overall corporate profitability 
in  internet growth is expected to drive the direct to customer segment to of total company revenues versus in fiscal from an investment perspective in fiscal  we expect capital spending to be in the range of  to  with over a third of that in e commerce and the supply chain that supports it 
an additional  in fiscal is expected to be invested in incremental selling  general and administrative functions to support our longer term e commerce  international and business development growth strategies as compared to fiscal while these selling  general and administrative investments are dilutive to earnings in fiscal  we expect them to begin to lever in fiscal and beyond 
from a business development perspective  we will continue to invest in organic growth strategies 
this has always been a key strength of ours and we believe we should always have several great ideas under development at any time 
but we also believe that there are opportunities to acquire new businesses that could help us more quickly achieve our growth objectives and we will assess these opportunities as they come along 
including all of these investments  in fiscal  we expect net revenues to increase in the range of to and diluted earnings per share to increase in the range of to 
also  during fiscal  we expect to return nearly  to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases

comparable store sales comparable stores are defined as those stores in which gross square footage did not change by more than in the previous months and which have been open for at least consecutive months without closure for seven or more consecutive days 
by measuring the year over year sales of merchandise in the stores that have a history of being open for a full comparable months or more  we can better gauge how the core store base is performing since it excludes new store openings  store remodelings and expansions 
comparable stores exclude new retail concepts until such time as we believe that comparable store results in those concepts are of sufficient size to evaluate the performance of the retail strategy  therefore  fiscal  and total comparable store sales exclude the west elm and williams sonoma home concepts 

table of contents percentages represent changes in comparable store sales versus the same period in the prior year 
growth decline in comparable store sales fiscal fiscal fiscal williams sonoma pottery barn pottery barn kids outlets total various factors affect comparable store sales  including the overall economic and general retail sales environment as well as current local and global economic conditions  each of which were significant factors in our comparable store sales results for fiscal additional factors have affected our comparable store sales results in the past and may continue to affect them in the future  such as the number  size and location of stores we open  close  remodel or expand in any period  consumer preferences and buying trends  changes in sales mix among distribution channels  our ability to efficiently source and distribute products  changes in our merchandise mix  competition including competitive promotional activity and discount retailers  the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events  the success of marketing programs  the cannibalization of existing store sales by our new stores  the benefits of closing underperforming stores in multi store markets  changes in catalog circulation and in our direct to customer business and fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
among other things  weather conditions can affect comparable store sales because inclement weather can alter consumer behavior or require us to close certain stores temporarily and thus reduce store traffic 
even if stores are not closed  many customers may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather 
these factors have caused our comparable store sales to fluctuate significantly in the past on an annual  quarterly and monthly basis and  as a result  we expect that comparable store sales will continue to fluctuate in the future

to determine if the value of our inventory should be marked down below cost  we consider current and anticipated demand  customer preferences  age of the merchandise and fashion trends 
our inventory value is adjusted periodically to reflect current market conditions  which requires management judgments that may significantly affect the ending inventory valuation  as well as gross margin 
the significant estimates used in inventory valuation are obsolescence including excess and slow moving inventory and lower of cost or market reserves and estimates of inventory shrinkage 
we reserve for obsolescence based on historical trends  aging reports  specific identification and our estimates of future retail sales prices 
reserves for shrinkage are estimated and recorded throughout the year  at the concept and channel level  as a percentage of net sales based on historical shrinkage results  expectations of future shrinkage and current inventory levels 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based on the results of our physical inventory count and can vary from our estimates due to such factors as changes in operations within our distribution centers  the mix of our inventory which ranges from large furniture to small tabletop items and execution against loss prevention initiatives in our stores  distribution centers  off site storage locations  and with our third party transportation providers 
accordingly  there is no remaining shrinkage reserve balance at year end 
due to these factors  our obsolescence and shrinkage reserves contain uncertainties 
both estimates have calculations that require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding a number of factors  including market conditions  the selling environment  historical results and current inventory trends 
if actual obsolescence or shrinkage estimates change from our original estimate  we will adjust our reserves accordingly throughout the year 
management does not believe that changes in the assumptions used in these estimates would have a significant effect on our inventory balances 
we have made no material changes to our assumptions included in the calculations of the obsolescence and shrinkage reserves throughout the year 
in addition  we do not believe a change in our inventory reserves would have a material effect on net earnings 
as of january  and january   our inventory obsolescence reserves were  and  respectively 
advertising and prepaid catalog expenses advertising expenses consist of media and production costs related to catalog mailings  e commerce advertising and other direct marketing activities 
all advertising costs are expensed as incurred  or upon the release of the initial advertisement  with the exception of prepaid catalog expenses 
prepaid catalog expenses consist primarily of third party incremental direct costs  including creative design  paper  printing  postage and mailing costs for all of our direct response catalogs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog expenses and are amortized over 
table of contents their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon the ratio of actual revenues to the total of actual and estimated future revenues on an individual catalog basis 
estimated future revenues are based upon various factors such as the total number of catalogs and pages circulated  the probability and magnitude of consumer response and the assortment of merchandise offered 
each catalog is generally fully amortized over a six to nine month period  with the majority of the amortization occurring within the first four to five months 
prepaid catalog expenses are evaluated for realizability on a monthly basis by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future profitability remaining net revenues less merchandise cost of goods sold  selling expenses and catalog related costs associated with that catalog 
if the catalog is not expected to be profitable  the carrying amount of the catalog is impaired accordingly 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
we review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment  primarily at a store level  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review for impairment all stores for which current or projected cash flows from operations are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets 
impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining life of the lease 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the store lease term generally to years is based upon our experience  historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability and economic conditions 
the future estimates of store profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth  gross margin  employment rates  lease escalations  inflation on operating expenses and the overall economics of the retail industry and are therefore subject to variability and difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the net carrying value and the asset s fair value 
long lived assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using level inputs as defined in the fair value hierarchy 
the fair value is estimated based upon future cash flows discounted at a rate that is commensurate with the risk and approximates our weighted average cost of capital 
we recorded impairment charges related to our underperforming retail stores of   and  in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
self insured liabilities we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and product and general liability claims 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed  including the development of those claims  and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors affecting this estimate include future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly 
we determine our workers compensation liability and product and general liability claims reserves based on an actuarial analysis of historical claims data 
self insurance reserves for employee health benefits  workers compensation and product and general liability claims were  and  as of january  and january   respectively  and are recorded within accrued salaries  benefits and other on our consolidated balance sheets 
customer deposits customer deposits are primarily comprised of unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates  and merchandise credits and deferred revenue related to undelivered merchandise 
we maintain a liability for unredeemed gift cards  gift certificates and merchandise credits until the earlier of redemption  escheatment or four years as we have concluded that the likelihood of our gift cards and gift certificates being redeemed beyond four years from the date of issuance is remote 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenues and the related cost of goods sold including shipping costs at the time the products are delivered to our customers 
revenue is recognized for retail sales excluding home delivered merchandise at the point of sale in the store and for home delivered merchandise and direct to customer sales when the merchandise is delivered to the customers 
discounts provided to customers are accounted for as a reduction of sales 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns in each reporting period 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customer are recognized as revenue at the time the products are delivered to the customer 
revenues are presented net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
sales returns reserve our customers may return purchased items for an exchange or refund 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns  net of cost of goods sold  based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance 
as of january  and january   our reserve for sales returns was  and  respectively 
stock based compensation we measure and record compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements for all stock based awards using a fair value method 
for stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights option awards  fair value is determined using the black scholes valuation model  while restricted stock units are valued using the closing price of our stock on the date prior to the date of issuance 
significant factors affecting the fair value of option awards include the estimated future volatility of our stock price and the estimated expected term until the option award is exercised or cancelled 
the fair value of the award is amortized over the requisite service period 
total stock based compensation expense was   and  which includes an  reversal of compensation expense related to performance based stock awards  see note h to our consolidated financial statements  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and is recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
additionally  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of our earnings 
in accordance with the accounting for income taxes and uncertain tax positions  we make estimates regarding the likelihood that certain tax positions will be realized upon ultimate settlement and we record reserves where necessary 
it is reasonably possible that current income tax examinations involving uncertain tax positions could be resolved within the next months through administrative adjudicative procedures or settlement 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include significant deterioration of the us and foreign markets  changes in us interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  including the devaluation of the us dollar  and the effects of uncertain economic forces which may affect the prices we pay our vendors in the foreign countries in which we do business 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk as of january   our line of credit facility was the only instrument we held with a variable interest rate which could  if drawn upon  subject us to risks associated with changes in that interest rate 
as of january   there were no amounts outstanding under our credit facility 
if the interest rate on this existing variable rate debt instrument rose  our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of short term investments classified as short term cash and cash equivalents  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
as of january   our investments  made primarily in money market funds and highly liquid us treasury bills  are stated at cost and approximate their fair values 
foreign currency risks we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are denominated in us dollars  however  only approximately of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
any currency risks related to these international purchase transactions were not significant to us during fiscal and fiscal since we pay for the majority of our international purchases in us dollars  however  a decline in the us dollar relative to other foreign currencies would subject us to risks associated with increased purchasing costs from our vendors in their effort to offset any lost profits associated with any currency devaluation 
we cannot predict with certainty the effect these increased costs may have on our financial statements or results of operations 
in addition  as of january   we have retail stores in canada and limited operations in europe and asia  each of which exposes us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
although these exchange rate fluctuations have not been material to us in the past  we may enter into foreign currency contracts in the future to minimize any currency remeasurement risk associated with the intercompany assets and liabilities of our subsidiaries 
we did not enter into any foreign currency contracts during fiscal or fiscal
