item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   which appear in item of part ii of this annual report 
recent developments on november   the corporation elected  at the request of the federal reserve board frb and to preserve capital resources  to defer regularly scheduled quarterly cash dividend payments on the  shares of its series a preferred stock  having a liquidation preference of  per share  that were issued to the treasury in january both the november  and the february  dividends  totaling  were deferred 
the terms of the series a preferred stock call for the payment of dividends on a quarterly basis at an annual rate of of the liquidation preference for the first five years  after which the dividend rate automatically increases to 
dividend payments on the series a preferred stock may be deferred without default  but the dividend is cumulative 
during a dividend deferral period  the corporation is prohibited from paying any cash dividends on or purchasing its common stock 
accordingly  in connection with the deferral  the corporation also suspended the payment of cash dividends on its common stock previously  
per share effective immediately 
if the corporation fails to pay dividends on the series a preferred stock for six quarters  whether or not consecutive  then the treasury will have the right to appoint up to two directors to the corporation s board of directors 
on december   the corporation  at the request of the frb and to preserve capital resources  elected to defer regularly scheduled quarterly interest payments with respect to an aggregate of million of its tps debentures  starting with the payments due in march an aggregate of 
pursuant to the indentures under which the tps debentures were issued  the corporation can elect to defer payments of interest for up to consecutive quarterly periods  provided that there is no event of default as defined in the indentures existing at the time of deferral 
the corporation is not in default under any of the indentures  and the election to defer interest payments is not a default under any of the indentures 
interest on the tps debentures will continue to accrue during the deferral period and interest on the deferred interest will also accrue  both of which must be paid at the end of the deferral period 
during a deferral period  the corporation may not  among other things and subject to certain exceptions  declare or pay dividends or otherwise make distributions with respect to the corporation s capital stock  purchase any of its capital stock  pay principal or interest on debt that ranks pari passu with or junior to the debentures  or make any payments under guarantees of the corporation which rank pari passu with or junior to the debentures 
the corporation intends to reevaluate the deferral of these payments periodically and  in consultation with its regulators  will consider reinstating these payments when appropriate 
overview the corporation is a financial holding company which  through the bank and its non bank subsidiaries  provides an array of financial products and services primarily to customers in four western maryland counties and four northeastern west virginia counties 
its principal operating subsidiary is the bank  which consists of a community banking network of branch offices located throughout its market areas 
our primary sources of revenue are interest income earned from our loan and investment securities portfolios and fees earned from financial services provided to customers 
consolidated net loss attributable to common shareholders for the year ended december  was million  compared to a net loss attributable to common shareholders of million for basic and diluted net loss per common share for the year ended december  was  compared to basic and diluted net loss per common share of for the net loss resulted primarily from an million decline in net interest income  million of net losses related to a restructuring of the investment portfolio that was intended to limit credit risk and potential market and interest rate risk from a rising rate environment  and million of losses and write downs on other real estate owned 
these losses were partially offset by a net tax benefit of million and a decrease of million in non cash credit related other than temporary impairment otti charges on the investment portfolio when comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december  the decline in net interest income resulted in a compressed net interest margin  on a fully tax equivalent basis  of when compared to for the year ended december  interest income on our interest earning assets declined million  on a fully tax equivalent basis  due to the increase in non accrual loans throughout  the decline in loan balances  the decrease in the investment portfolio and the lower interest rate environment 
additionally  during and  we elected to maintain an increased liquidity position 
our cash position increased significantly due to our election not to reinvest cash from called investments  repayment of loans  and growth in our retail deposit base 
the increase in cash levels has had a negative impact on our net interest income for the year ended december  of approximately million  or basis points on our net interest margin 
as part of our strategic plan  we intend to reduce cash levels by paying off certain liabilities scheduled to mature in our plan also includes strategies to change the composition of our deposit mix  focusing on lower cost  core deposits 
the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of specific allocations were made for impaired loans where management has determined that the collateral supporting the loans is not adequate to cover the loan balance 
additionally  management increased the qualitative factors affecting the allowance for loan losses as a result of the current recession and distressed economic environment and the historical loss factors increased as a result of increased charge offs on our loan portfolio 
interest expense on our interest bearing liabilities decreased million during when compared to in spite of a million increase in average deposits partially offset by a million decrease in average debt outstanding 
the decline in expense was due to the low interest rate environment  our decision to only increase special pricing for full relationship customers and retail and brokered certificates of deposit renewing at lower interest rates due to the short duration of our portfolio 
other operating income increased million during when compared to this increase was primarily attributable to a decrease of million in non cash credit related otti charges on the investment portfolio offset by an increase of million of net losses related to the above mentioned restructuring of the investment portfolio 
management also noted a 
million decline in service charge income which was driven primarily by a decrease in overdraft income resulting from the decline in consumer spending and the new overdraft fee restrictions imposed under the dodd frank act 
it is uncertain how proposed regulations introduced by the bureau of consumer financial protection will impact service charge income in the future 
operating expenses decreased million in when compared to this decrease was due primarily to a million decline in salaries and benefits resulting from reduced service costs in the pension plan and elimination of all performance based pay for employees and management in other miscellaneous expenses decreased 
million for when compared to this decrease is attributable to reductions in expenses such as marketing  legal and professional  and consulting expenses 
operations in were impacted by the following factors and strategic initiatives excess liquidity loan and deposit growth impact on net interest margin throughout and  we elected to maintain an increased liquidity position due to the increased risk in our loan portfolio as a result of the recession and the changing regulatory environment 
our cash position increased significantly due to our election not to reinvest cash from called investments and continued growth in our retail deposit base 
the increase in cash levels had a negative impact on our net interest income of approximately million  or basis points on our net interest margin 
as part of our strategic plan  we intend to reduce cash levels by paying off certain liabilities scheduled to mature in our plan also includes strategies to change the composition of our deposit mix  focusing on lower cost  core deposits 
loans decreased million in when compared to loans at december  commercial real estate loans increased million as management focused on growing the small business loan portfolio and as certain acquisition and development loans  which decreased million  were completed and transferred to permanent financing 
the acquisition and development category also declined due to charged off balances  foreclosures  and working some troubled credits out of the bank 
commercial and industrial loans declined million and residential mortgage loans declined million 
the decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio was attributable to the increased amount of loan refinancings that occurred as consumers sought long term fixed rate loans 
we do not retain these long term fixed rate loans  and we use secondary market and fannie mae outlets to satisfy these loan requests 
the consumer portfolio declined million as repayment activity in the indirect auto portfolio exceeded new production resulting from the continued slowdown in economic activity and management s decision not to compete with the special financing offered by the automotive manufacturers and large regional banks 
management anticipates that the economy will continue its slow recovery from the recent recession and it is likely that we will continue to experience low loan demand in our strategic plan focuses on growth of existing relationships and building our portfolio of owner occupied business loans  multifamily residential loans and certain commercial and industrial loans that are utilized by community oriented business owners 
we will also continue to work with our distressed borrowers in an effort to reduce our current level of non performing loans 
interest income on loans in decreased by million on a fully taxable equivalent basis when compared to due to the decrease in interest rates and the increase in average non accrual loans 
interest income on investment securities decreased by million  on a fully taxable equivalent basis due to a million decrease in the portfolio 
additional information on the composition of interest income is available in table that appears on page 
total deposits decreased million during when compared to deposits at december  non interest bearing deposits increased million 
traditional savings accounts increased million offset by a million decline in retail money market accounts 
time deposits less than  declined million and time deposits greater than  increased million 
the increase in time deposits greater than  was primarily due to a million increase in the cdars product for a local municipality 
these funds are short term and will mature by march interest expense decreased million in when compared to the decline was due to an overall reduction in interest rates on time deposits driven by our decision to only increase special rates for full relationship customers  the shorter duration of the portfolio and the increase in non interest bearing deposits 
the overall net interest margin decreased during to from in on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
other operating income other operating expense other operating income  exclusive of losses  decreased 
million during when compared to service charge income decreased 
million due primarily to a reduction in non sufficient funds nsf fees and increased charged off overdraft fees 
the creation of the bureau of consumer financial protection and its proposed regulation of overdraft fees and interchange fees could have a negative impact on service charge income in the future 
whether this will occur and the extent to which it will reduce service charge income is uncertain at this time 
trust department income increased 
million during when compared to due to an increase in assets under management and the fees received on those accounts 
income on bank owned life insurance increased 
million during when compared to due to the surrender of the separate account contracts and purchase of general account contracts during the fourth quarter of net losses of million were reported through other income during the year ended december   compared to net losses million for the year ended december  there were million in losses in that were attributable to non cash otti charges on the investment portfolio  down from the million in other losses of million during consisted primarily of a net loss of million from sales of investments  
million from a loan sale in the second quarter and million from losses and write downs on other real estate owned 
other operating expenses decreased million for the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the decrease during was primarily due to a decline of million in salaries and benefits resulting from reduced service costs in the pension plan and elimination of all performance based pay for employees and management 
fdic premiums increased 
million during when compared to the same period of due to the increased rate structure 
other miscellaneous expenses decreased 
million for when compared to the same time period of this decrease was attributable to reductions in expenses such as marketing  legal and professional  and consulting expenses

looking forward we will continue to face risks and challenges in the future  including changes in local economic conditions in our core geographic markets  potential yield compression on loan and deposit products from existing competitors and potential new entrants in our markets  fluctuations in interest rates and changes to existing federal and state legislation and regulations over banks and financial holding companies 
for a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors  see item a of part i of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report 
on an on going basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to loan losses and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses one of our most important accounting policies is that related to the monitoring of the loan portfolio 
a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio  including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of underlying collateral  the timing of loan charge offs and the placement of loans on non accrual status 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payment on loans 
estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with specific loans and the loan portfolio  current and historical trends in delinquencies and charge offs  and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction  changes in lending rates  political conditions  legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to western maryland and northeastern west virginia 
because the calculation of the allowance for loan losses relies on management s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  actual results may differ from management s estimates 
the allowance for loan losses is also discussed below in item under the caption allowance for loan losses and in note to consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report 
goodwill and other intangible assets asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other  establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and impairment assessment of goodwill 
we have million related to acquisitions of insurance books of business which is subject to amortization 
the million in recorded goodwill is primarily related to the acquisition of huntington national bank branches that occurred in and the acquisition of insurance books of business in  which is not subject to periodic amortization 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
impairment testing requires that the fair value of each of the corporation s reporting units be compared to the carrying amount of its net assets  including goodwill 
if the estimated current fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  no additional testing is required and an impairment loss is not recorded 
otherwise  additional testing is performed  and to the extent such additional testing results in a conclusion that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized 
our goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business and the value is dependent upon our ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a highly competitive local market 
this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features and the ease of use of our services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
asc topic requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
the determination of whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments and estimates 
throughout  the corporation common stock was trading below its book value consistent with its peer group 
at december   the corporation s stock price was significantly below its tangible book value 
management felt that this decrease could indicate the possibility of impairment 
management consulted a third party valuation specialist to assist in the determination of the fair value of the corporation  considering both the market approach guideline public company method and the income approach discounted future benefits method 
due to the illiquidity in our stock and the adverse conditions surrounding the banking industry  reliance was placed on the income approach in determining the fair value of the corporation 
the income approach is a discounted cash flow analysis that is determined by adding a the present value  which is a representation of the current value of a sum that is to be received some time in the future  of the estimated net income  net of dividends paid out  that the corporation could generate over the next five years and b the present value of a terminal value  which is a representation of the current value of an entity at a specified time in the future 
the terminal value was calculated using both a price to tangible book multiple method and a capitalization method and the more conservative of the two was utilized in the fair value calculation 
significant assumptions used in the above methods include net income from the corporation s forward five year operating budget  incorporating conservative growth and mix assumptions a discount rate of based on the most recent 
q cost of capital report from morningstar ibbotson associates for the commercial banking sector adjusted for a size and risk premium of basis points a price to tangible book multiple of  the median multiple of the commercial bank mergers and acquisitions during for selling bank and holding companies headquartered in dc  de  md  nc  nj  ny  pa  va and wv mid atlantic area as provided by snl financial and corporation reports a capitalization rate of discount rate of adjusted for a conservative growth rate of the resulting fair value of the income approach resulted in the fair value of the corporation exceeding the carrying value by 
management stressed the assumptions used in the analysis to provide additional support to the value derived 
the discount rate could increase to before the excess would be eliminated in the tangible multiple method or the assumption of the tangible book multiple could reduce to and still result in a fair value in excess of book value 
based on the results of the evaluation  management concluded that the recorded value of goodwill at december  was not impaired 
however  future changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
the corporation will continue to evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and as events occur or circumstances change 
accounting for income taxes the corporation accounts for income taxes by recording deferred income taxes that reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
management exercises significant judgment in the evaluation of the amount and timing of the recognition of the resulting tax assets and liabilities 
the judgments and estimates required for the evaluation are updated based upon changes in business factors and the tax laws 
a valuation allowance is recognized to reduce any deferred tax assets that based upon available information  it is more likely than not all  or any portion  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
assessing the need for  and amount of  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment and analysis of evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets 
in most cases  the realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the recognition of deferred tax liabilities and generating a sufficient level of taxable income in future periods  which can be difficult to predict 
our largest deferred tax assets involve differences related to allowance for loan losses and unrealized losses on investment securities 
given the nature of our deferred tax assets  management determined no valuation allowances were needed at either december  or except for a state valuation allowance for certain state deferred tax assets associated with our first united corporation 
management expects that our adherence to the required accounting guidance may result in increased volatility in quarterly and annual effective income tax rates because of changes in judgment or measurement including changes in actual and forecasted income before taxes  tax laws and regulations  and tax planning strategies 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities securities available for sale securities available for sale are stated at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component in shareholders equity 
the amortized cost of debt securities classified as available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums to the first call date  if applicable  or to maturity  and for accretion of discounts to maturity  or in the case of mortgage backed securities  over the estimated life of the security 
such amortization and accretion  plus interest and dividends  are included in interest income from investments 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded using the specific identification method 
management systematically evaluates securities for impairment on a quarterly basis 
based upon application of accounting guidance for subsequent measurement in topic asc section  management assesses whether a it has the intent to sell a security being evaluated and b it is more likely than not that the corporation will be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery 
if neither applies  then declines in the fair values of securities below their cost that are considered other than temporary declines are split into two components 
the first is the loss attributable to declining credit quality 
credit losses are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment determination is made 
the second component consists of all other losses  which are recognized in other comprehensive loss 
in estimating otti losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  adverse conditions specifically related to the security  an industry  or a geographic area  the historic and implied volatility of the fair value of the security  changes in the rating of the security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest or principal payments  and the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future 
management also monitors cash flow projections for securities that are considered beneficial interests under the guidance of asc subtopic  investments other beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  asc section 
this process is described more fully in the investment securities section of the consolidated balance sheet review 
fair value of investments we have determined the fair value of our investment securities in accordance with the requirements of asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements 
the corporation measures the fair market values of its investments based on the fair value hierarchy established in topic the determination of fair value of investments and other assets is discussed further in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report 
pension plan assumptions our pension plan costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  as discussed within the requirements of asc topic  compensation retirement benefits 
pension expense and the determination of our projected pension liability are based upon two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
we evaluate each of these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions impact the determination of pension expense and the projected liability including the primary employee demographics  such as retirement patterns  employee turnover  mortality rates  and estimated employer compensation increases 
these factors  along with the critical assumptions  are carefully reviewed by management each year in consultation with our pension plan consultants and actuaries 
further information about our pension plan assumptions  the plan s funded status  and other plan information is included in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of part ii of this annual report 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  part ii of this annual report discusses new accounting pronouncements that when adopted  may have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated statement of income review net interest income net interest income is our largest source of operating revenue 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
for analytical and discussion purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent fte basis to facilitate performance comparisons between taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate 
the table below summarizes net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis for the and dollars in thousands interest income interest expense net interest income net interest margin net interest income on an fte basis decreased million during the year ended december  over the same period in due to a million decrease in interest income partially offset by a million decrease in interest expense 
the decrease in net interest income resulted primarily from a shift in the mix of earning assets from loans and investment securities to cash and cash equivalents other interest earning assets for the periods compared  as we made the decision to increase our liquidity position during this period of risk and economic uncertainty 
the cost of the liquidity position represented by the foregone interest income from the million in incremental average liquidity was approximately million  or basis points of the basis point decrease in the net interest margin from during to for the increase in non earning assets also negatively impacted net interest income and margin 
the overall million increase in average interest earning assets at lower yields also impacted the basis point decline in the average yield on our average earning assets  which dropped from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  on an fte basis 
this reflected our increased liquidity levels 
interest expense decreased during when compared to due to an overall reduction in interest rates on time deposits driven by our decision to only increase special rates for full relationship customers  and the shorter duration of the portfolio 
this more than offset the impact of a million increase in average interest bearing liabilities in when compared to the same time period for  with interest bearing deposits increasing by approximately million 
the overall effect of these changes was a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on our average interest bearing liabilities from for the year ended december  to for the same period of as shown below  the composition of total interest income between and reflects a shift toward interest and fees on loans from investment securities 
this shift was the result of accumulating cash from calls on securities in the investment portfolio in order to enhance our liquidity position

provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period of the slight increase in the provision for loan losses resulted from increases in the rolling historical loss rates and qualitative factors utilized in the determination of the allowance for loans collectively evaluated 
management strives to ensure that the allowance for loan losses reflects a level commensurate with the risk inherent in our loan portfolio

million in when compared to  exclusive of net losses 
the decline in service charges on deposit accounts was due primarily to a reduction in nsf fees  increased charge off overdrafts and the new overdraft regulation implemented in august as a result of the dodd frank act 
the creation of the bureau of consumer financial protection and its proposed regulation of overdraft fees and interchange fees could have a negative impact on service charge income in the future 
whether this will occur and the extent to which it will reduce service charge income is uncertain at this time 
we also experienced decreases in other income such as fee income from our investments in maryland and west virginia title companies 
trust department income increased during when compared to due to an increase in assets under management and the fees received on those account 
assets under management were million and million for years and  respectively 
insurance commissions decreased in when compared to due to reduced premiums and contingency income 
contingency income is received from the insurance carriers based upon claims histories and varies from year to year 
we experienced an increase in bank owned life insurance earnings of 
million for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in due to the surrender of the separate account and purchase of general account contracts during the fourth quarter of other operating expense other operating expense for decreased million when compared to the following table shows the major components of other operating expense for the past two years and the percentage changes during these years dollars in thousands change salaries and employee benefits other expenses fdic premiums equipment occupancy data processing total other operating expense the million decrease in salaries and employee benefits during when compared to resulted from reduced service costs in the pension plan and elimination of all performance based pay for employees and management 
other expenses decreased by due primarily to decreases in marketing  legal and professional  and consulting expenses 
the reduction in equipment expense resulted from a decrease in depreciation 
applicable income taxes due to the net loss incurred in  we recognized a net tax benefit of million  compared to a net tax benefit of million in the net tax benefits generated in and resulted primarily from the non cash otti charges on our investment portfolio of million and million  respectively  and the increased loan loss provision 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes for detailed analysis of our deferred tax assets and liabilities 
a valuation allowance has been provided for the state tax loss carry forwards of million included in deferred tax assets which will expire commencing in we have concluded that no valuation allowance is deemed necessary for our remaining federal and state net deferred tax assets at december   as it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on the following the expected reversal of all but million of the total million of deferred tax liabilities at december  in such a manner to substantially utilize the dollar for dollar impact against the deferred tax assets at december   for the remaining excess deferred tax assets that will not be utilized by the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  our expected future income will be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax assets as they reverse or before any net operating loss  if created  would expire  and several tax planning strategies that can provide both one time increases to taxable income of up to approximately million and recurring annual decreases in unfavorable permanent items 
we will need to generate future taxable income of approximately million to fully utilize the net deferred tax assets in the years in which they are expected to reverse 
management estimates that we can fully utilize the deferred tax assets in approximately seven years based on the historical pre tax income and forecasts of estimated future pre tax income as adjusted for permanent book to tax differences 
consolidated balance sheet review overview our total assets decreased to billion at december   representing a decrease of million from year end the total interest earning asset mix at december  shows a decline in the percentage of loans and investments as a percentage of total assets from to as we increased our cash and cash equivalents for liquidity purposes 
the mix for each year is illustrated below year end percentage of total assets cash and cash equivalents net loans investments the year end total liability mix has remained consistent during the two year period as illustrated below 
year end percentage of total liabilities total deposits total borrowings loan portfolio the bank is actively engaged in originating loans to customers primarily in allegany county  frederick county  garrett county  and washington county in maryland  and in berkeley county  hardy county  mineral county  and monongalia county in west virginia  and the surrounding regions of west virginia and pennsylvania 
we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of our loan portfolio 
these policies include underwriting standards for new credits as well as continuous monitoring and reporting policies for asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
these policies  coupled with ongoing training efforts  have provided effective checks and balances for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the type of the loan  and the experience of the lending officer 
commercial loans are collateralized primarily by real estate and  to a lesser extent  equipment and vehicles 
unsecured commercial loans represent an insignificant portion of total commercial loans 
residential mortgage loans are collateralized by the related property 
any residential mortgage loan exceeding a specified internal loan to value ratio requires private mortgage insurance 
installment loans are typically collateralized  with loan to value ratios which are established based on the financial condition of the borrower 
we will also make unsecured consumer loans to qualified borrowers meeting our underwriting standards 
additional information about our loans and underwriting policies can be found in item of part i of this annual report under the caption banking products and services 
table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio 
historically  our policy has been to make the majority of our loan commitments in our market areas 
we had no foreign loans in our portfolio as of december for any of the periods presented 
summary of loan portfolio table the following table presents the composition of our loan portfolio for the past five years in millions commercial real estate acquisition and development commercial and industrial residential mortgage consumer total loans comparing loans at december  to loans at december   our loan portfolio decreased by million 
commercial real estate loans increased million as management focused on growing the small business loan portfolio and as certain acquisition and development loans  which decreased million  were completed and transferred to permanent financing 
the acquisition and development category also declined due to charged off balances  foreclosures  and working some troubled credits out of the bank 
commercial and industrial loans declined million and residential mortgage declined million 
the decrease in the residential mortgage portfolio is attributable to the increased amount of loan refinancings that are occurring as consumers seek long term fixed rate loans 
we do not retain these long term fixed rate loans  but use secondary market and fannie mae outlets to satisfy these loan requests 
the consumer portfolio declined million as repayment activity in the indirect auto portfolio exceeded new production resulting from the continued slowdown in economic activity and management s decision not to compete with the special financing offered by the automotive manufacturers 
indirect auto loans comprise the largest percentage of consumer loans  at december  and at december  at december   adjustable interest rate loans made up of total loans  compared to at december  fixed interest rate loans made up of the total loan portfolio at december   compared to of total loans at december  comparing loans at december  to loans at december   our loan portfolio decreased by million 
growth in commercial real estate loans million  acquisition and development loans million and commercial and industrial loans million was offset by a decline in our residential mortgage portfolio million and a decline in our consumer portfolio million 
the decrease in consumer loans was primarily attributable to a decline in the indirect loan portfolio resulting from a slowdown in economic activity and management s de emphasis of this form of lending product

management considers such factors as payment history  the nature of the collateral securing the loan  and the overall economic situation of the borrower when making a non accrual decision 
management closely monitors the status of all non accrual loans 
a non accruing loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current  it becomes well secured  or is in the process of collection and the prospects of future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
generally  consumer installment loans are not placed on non accrual status  but are charged off after they are days contractually past due

these loans consist primarily of acquisition and development loans and commercial real estate loans 
the fair values are generally determined based upon independent third party appraisals of the collateral 
management applies a sensitivity analysis to appraised values based upon an internally prepared grid that considers the age of the third party appraisal and the geographic region where the collateral is located 
generally  if the appraisal is more than months old  a new appraisal is obtained 
valuations are typically based on an as is appraised value 
at december   the fair value of one loan totaling million was determined using discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds 
specific allocations have been made where management believes there is insufficient collateral to repay the loan balance if liquidated and there is no secondary source of repayment available 
the level of performing impaired loans other than performing tdrs declined million during the year ended december  in  due to the deteriorating credit environment  management made a concerted effort to reduce the risk in our portfolio by enhancing efforts to structure plans for some of our larger impaired credits to maximize their collectability by converting interest only lines of credit to amortizing term loans 
during  as loans demonstrated sustained payment performance  management determined that we should be able to collect full contractual principal and interest and  accordingly  removed them from an impaired status 
during  million of loans were removed from impaired status due to satisfactory payment performance  another million of loans were paid off and million in principal reductions were received 
in  million of previously performing impaired loans were transferred to non accrual or foreclosure and million were transferred to performing tdrs 
one loan totaling million and four loans totaling million of loans reclassified from performing tdrs were added to performing impaired loans in management will continue to monitor loans that have been removed from an impaired status and take appropriate steps in an effort to ensure that satisfactory performance is sustained 
the level of tdrs declined million during  with five loans totaling million added to performing tdrs  three loans totaling million added to non performing tdrs and million removed from tdr reporting 
five non accrual tdrs totaling million were foreclosed on and one non accrual tdr had a partial charge off of million

million in allowance for loan losses an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses from the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio  assessment of current economic conditions  diversification and size of the portfolio  adequacy of collateral  past and anticipated loss experience  and the amount of non performing loans 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and actual losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly  and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the allowance for loan losses 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is consistent with prior years 
an estimate for probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and binding but unfunded loan commitments is also prepared 
this estimate is computed in a manner similar to the methodology described above  adjusted for the probability of actually funding the commitment 
the allowance for loan losses increased to million at december   compared to million at december  the provision for loan losses remained stable for the year ended december  at million compared to million for the same period of net charge offs increased to million at december  from million at december  as part of our loan review process  management has noted an increase in foreclosures and bankruptcies in the geographic areas in which we operate 
additionally  the current economic environment has caused a decline in real estate sales 
consequently  we have closely reviewed and applied sensitivity analyses to collateral values to more adequately measure potential future losses 
where necessary  we have obtained new appraisals on collateral 
specific allocations of the allowance have been provided in these instances where losses may occur 
as of december   the balance of the allowance was equal to of total loans 
historical charge off rates are utilized in the calculation of the allowance for loan losses based on a rolling eight quarter average for commercial loans and a rolling twelve quarter average for consumer loans 
year to date charge offs include million for two loans in the acquisition and development portfolio that were transferred to other real estate owned  a million charge off of one loan in the commercial and industrial portfolio  and million of partial charge offs for three loans in the acquisition and development portfolio 
these charge offs were the primary contributors of the annualized net charge off loss rate of in the acquisition and development portfolio and in the commercial and industrial portfolio 
the annualized charge off rate in the consumer loan portfolio is the result of our policy of charging off these loans after they are days contractually past due 
accruing loans past due days or more increased to of the loan portfolio at december  from of the loan portfolio at december  this increase was due to an increase in the consumer portfolio delinquency rates from at december  to at december  and an increase in the commercial portfolios delinquency rate from to in the same time period 
the rate of loans entering delinquency remained consistent in the commercial portfolios  with loans days past due increasing slightly from of those portfolios at december  to at december  as a result of management s evaluation of the loan portfolio using the factors and methodology described above  management believes the allowance for loan losses is appropriate as of december  the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased to million at december   from million at december  several factors contributed to the million increase in the balance of the allowance in  including a significant increase in the balance of non accrual loans  from million in to million in  changes to the qualitative factors which are reviewed quarterly and reflect the current economic environment  an increase in impaired loans from million in to million in  and an increase in the percentage of net charge offs to average outstanding loans from

all of these types of credit facilities were thoroughly reviewed by management during as to the adequacy of the collateral  the valuation of collateral  secondary sources of repayment  and other credit quality attributes 
collateral valuations were also subject to a sensitivity and shock analysis in order to identify loans that may not have had sufficient collateral in the event of a significant decline in the market value of the collateral 
as a result of these extensive reviews  specific allocations of the allowance were made for several loans 
at december   the balance of the allowance was equal to of total loans  which was times the amount of net charge offs for the year

as part of this restructuring  available for sale securities with an aggregate fair value of million were transferred to the trading portfolio  comprised of million from the collateralized mortgage obligations cmo portfolio  million from the us government agency and residential mortgage backed agency portfolios  and million from the municipal securities portfolio 
unrealized losses of million and unrealized gains of million were recognized in earnings at the time of transfer 
the bonds selected for transfer to trading and ultimate sale were chosen to maximize the following benefits a reduction of extension and price risk in a rising interest rate environment  recognition of gains on callable agency securities and fixed rate mortgage backed securities that will disappear with rising rates  and improvement in the credit quality of the portfolio through reduction of the private label cmo portfolio with the most exposure to potential credit risk 
as of december   all of the aforementioned securities had been sold  resulting in an additional 
million net loss on the trading transaction 
as of december   the replacement securities had been purchased except for approximately million  which is reflected in the increase in cash 
management anticipates that any future acquired replacement securities will be shorter term in nature  structured to take advantage of higher interest rates through incorporation of staggered cash flows  and collateral eligible  providing additional liquidity to the portfolio 
at december   the securities classified as available for sale included a net unrealized loss of million  which represents the difference between the fair value and amortized cost of securities in the portfolio and is primarily attributable to the collateralized debt obligations 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report  we measure fair market values based on the fair value hierarchy established in asc topic  fair value measurements and disclosures 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
level prices or valuation techniques require inputs that are both significant to the valuation assumptions and are not readily observable in the market ie supported with little or no market activity 
these level instruments are valued based on both observable and unobservable inputs derived from the best available data  some of which is internally developed  and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require 
approximately million of the available for sale portfolio was valued using level pricing  and had net unrealized gains of million at december  the remaining million of the securities available for sale represents the entire cdo portfolio  which was valued using significant unobservable inputs  or level pricing 
the million in unrealized losses associated with this portfolio relates to pooled trust preferred securities that comprise the cdo portfolio 
unrealized losses of million represent non credit related otti charges on of the securities  while million of unrealized losses relates to five securities which have no credit related otti 
the unrealized losses on these securities are primarily attributable to continued depression in the marketability and liquidity associated with cdos 
the following table provides a summary of the trust preferred securities in the cdo portfolio and the credit status of the securities as of december  level investment securities available for sale dollars in thousands investment description first united level investments security credit status deal class amortized cost fair market value unrealized gain loss lowest credit rating original collateral deferrals defaults as of original collateral performing collateral collateral support collateral support as of performing collateral number of performing issuers total issuers preferred term security i mezz c  preferred term security xi b  c  preferred term security xvi c c  preferred term security xviii c   c  preferred term security xviii c  c  preferred term security xix c   c  preferred term security xix c   c  preferred term security xix c   c  preferred term security xix c   c  preferred term security xxii c   c  preferred term security xxii c   c  preferred term secunty xxiii c   c  preferred term security xxbi d c  preferred term security xxiii d   c  preferred term security xxiv c c  preferred term security i p i b   ccc preferred term security i p iv b    ccc preferred term security i p iv b    ccc total level securities available for sale   security has been deemed other than temporary impaired and loss has been recognized in accordance with asc section the terms of the debentures underlying trust preferred securities in our investment portfolio allow the issuers of the debentures to defer interest payments for up to quarters  and  in such case  the terms of the related trust preferred securities allow their issuers to defer dividend payments for up to quarters 
some of the issuers of the trust preferred securities in our investment portfolio have defaulted and or deferred payments ranging from to of the total collateral balances underlying the securities 
the securities were designed to include structural features that provide investors with credit enhancement or support to provide default protection by subordinated tranches 
these features include over collateralization of the notes or subordination  excess interest or spread which will redirect funds in situations where collateral is insufficient  and a specified order of principal payments 
there are securities in our portfolio that are under collateralized  and this fact represents additional stress on our tranche 
however  in these cases  the terms of the securities require excess interest to be redirected from subordinate tranches as credit support  which provides additional support to our investment 
management systematically evaluates securities for impairment on a quarterly basis 
based upon application of topic asc section  management must assess whether a it has the intent to sell the security and b it is more likely than not that the corporation will be required to sell the security prior to its anticipated recovery 
if neither applies  then declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are considered other than temporary declines are split into two components 
the first is the loss attributable to declining credit quality 
credit losses are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment determination is made 
the second component consists of all other losses 
the other losses are recognized in other comprehensive income 
in estimating otti charges  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  adverse conditions specifically related to the security  an industry  or a geographic area  the historic and implied volatility of the security  changes in the rating of a security by a rating agency  recoveries or additional declines in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  failure of the issuer of the security to make scheduled interest payments  and the payment structure of the debt security and the likelihood of the issuer being able to make payments that increase in the future 
due to the duration and the significant market value decline in the pooled trust preferred securities held in our portfolio  we performed more extensive testing on these securities for purposes of evaluating whether or not an otti has occurred 
the market for these securities at december  is not active and markets for similar securities are also not active 
the inactivity was evidenced first by a significant widening of the bid ask spread in the brokered markets in which these securities trade and then by a significant decrease in the volume of trades relative to historical levels 
the new issue market is also inactive  as no new cdos have been issued since there are currently very few market participants who are willing to transact for these securities 
the market values for these securities  or any securities other than those issued or guaranteed by the treasury  are very depressed relative to historical levels 
therefore  in the current market  a low market price for a particular bond may only provide evidence of stress in the credit markets in general rather than being an indicator of credit problems with a particular issue 
given the conditions in the current debt markets and the absence of observable transactions in the secondary and new issue markets  management has determined that a the few observable transactions and market quotations that are available are not reliable for the purpose of obtaining fair value at december   b an income valuation approach technique ie present value that maximizes the use of relevant observable inputs and minimizes the use of observable inputs will be equally or more representative of fair value than a market approach  and c the cdo segment is appropriately classified within level of the valuation hierarchy because management determined that significant adjustments were required to determine fair value at the measurement date 
beginning in the first quarter of  management utilized an independent third party to prepare both the evaluations of otti as well as the fair value determinations for its cdo portfolio 
in previous periods  management performed internal impairment valuations and utilized a third party service for the portfolio pricing 
management will continue to review the assumptions and results and does not believe that there were any material differences in the impairment evaluations and pricing between december  and december  the approach of the third party utilized beginning in the first quarter of to determine fair value involved several steps  including detailed credit and structural evaluation of each piece of collateral in each bond  default  recovery and prepayment amortization probabilities for each piece of collateral in the bond  and discounted cash flow modeling 
the discount rate methodology used by the third party combines a baseline current market yield for comparable corporate and structured credit products with adjustments based on evaluations of the differences found in structure and risks associated with actual and projected credit performance of each cdo being valued 
currently  the only active and liquid trading market that exists is for stand alone trust preferred securities 
therefore  adjustments to the baseline discount rate are also made to reflect the additional leverage found in structured instruments 
based upon a review of credit quality and the cash flow tests performed by the independent third party  management determined that two securities had an additional 
million of credit related otti during the fourth quarter of and securities with previously recorded otti had no further impairment 
we recorded million otti charges on the cdo securities in earnings for the year ended december  management does not intend to sell these securities nor is it more likely than not that we will be required to sell the securities prior to recovery 
the risk based capital ratios require that banks set aside additional capital for securities that are rated below investment grade 
securities rated one level below investment grade require a risk weighting 
additional methods are applicable to securities rated more than one level below investment grade 
future declines in market value and credit related impairment charges on this portfolio are dependent upon the performance of the underlying collateral  the liquidity of the markets in which they trade and the assumptions used in the calculation of the impairment 
because these securities require additional capital be set aside for risk based capital ratios  further recognition of otti charges will primarily impact earnings and tier capital 
as of december   management believes that we maintain sufficient capital and liquidity to cover the additional capital requirements of these securities and future operating expenses 
additionally  we do not anticipate any material commitments or expected outlays of capital in the near term

the increase in time deposits greater than  was primarily due to a million increase in the cdars product for a local municipality 
these funds are short term and will mature by march during the fourth quarter of  million of brokered certificates of deposit were repaid and million of cdars one way buy funds were repaid 
although brokered deposits are at very low rates in the current environment  management made the decision to deploy a portion of the excess liquidity to reduce the volatility of the deposit base and to repay these funds rather than renew the borrowings 
the following table sets forth the maturities of time deposits of  or more maturity of time deposits of  or more table in thousands december  maturities months or less months months over year total during and  the bank shifted its focus on certificates of deposit of  or more  particularly brokered deposits  to longer term maturities as we anticipate a flat to rising interest rate environment in the future

additionally  million of cdars balances will mature in the first quarter of as part of our strategic plan  we intend to reduce cash levels by paying off certain brokered deposits  fhlb advances and public money scheduled to mature in our plan also includes strategies to change the composition of our deposit mix  focusing on lower cost  core deposits

this decrease in was due to the million decline in short term borrowings as our treasury management customers used their deposits during and the repayment of million in long term fhlb advances during the year 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million in tps debentures that were issued to trust iii in january total borrowings decreased by million or in when compared to  while the average balance of borrowings increased by million during the same period 
this decrease in is due to having no overnight borrowings at december  and the repayment of a million long term fhlb advance during the year 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million in junior subordinated debentures that were issued to trust iii in december during  the bank took advantage of opportunities to borrow long term fhlb advances and match these borrowings with specific interest earning assets where possible 
management will continue to closely monitor interest rates within the context of its overall asset liability management process 
see the interest rate sensitivity section of this item for further discussion on this topic 
at december   we had additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb totaling million  an additional million of unused lines of credit with various financial institutions  million of an unused secured line of credit with the federal reserve bank and approximately million through wholesale money market funds 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  for further details about our borrowings and additional borrowing capacity  which is incorporated herein by reference 
capital resources the bank and the corporation are subject to risk based capital regulations  which were adopted and are monitored by federal banking regulators 
these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and stand by letters of credit 
the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier capital  consisting of common shareholders equity  qualifying portion of trust issued preferred securities  and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier capital  consists of elements such as subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  remaining portion of trust issued preferred securities  and grandfathered senior debt  plus the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum for well capitalized banks total risk based capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier ratio of for well capitalized banks 
the risk based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier i capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for well capitalized banks for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
regulators may require higher capital ratios when warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking organizations must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based deposit insurance assessments 
our capital policy establishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements and takes into consideration current or anticipated risks as well as potential future growth opportunities 
at december   first united corporation s total risk based capital ratio was  which was well above the regulatory minimum of  and the bank s total risk based capital was  which was well above the regulatory minimum of 
the total risk based capital ratios of first united corporation and the bank for year end were and  respectively 
as of december   the most recent notification from the regulators categorizes the corporation and the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  for additional information regarding regulatory capital ratios 
total shareholders equity decreased million to million at december   from million at december   primarily due to declines in retained earnings offset by improvements in accumulated other comprehensive loss

information about the terms of these securities is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report 
cash dividends in the amount of million were paid on the series a preferred stock during the november and february payments of

the ability of first united corporation to make these interest payments depends on our earnings in future quarters 
liquidity management liquidity is a financial institution s capability to meet customer demands for deposit withdrawals while funding all credit worthy loans 
the factors that determine the institutions liquidity are reliability and stability of core deposits cash flow structure and pledging status of investments potential for unexpected loan demand we actively manage our liquidity position through weekly meetings of the treasury sub committee of executive management  which looks forward months at day intervals 
the measurement is based upon the projection of funds sold or purchased position  along with ratios and trends developed to measure dependence on purchased funds and core growth 
monthly reviews by management and quarterly reviews by the asset and liability committee under prescribed policies and procedures are designed to ensure that we will maintain adequate levels of available funds 
it is our policy to manage our affairs so that liquidity needs are fully satisfied through normal bank operations 
that is  the bank will manage its liquidity to minimize the need to make unplanned sales of assets or to borrow funds under emergency conditions 
the bank will use funding sources where the interest cost is relatively insensitive to market changes in the short run periods of one year or less to satisfy operating cash needs 
the remaining normal funding will come from interest sensitive liabilities  either deposits or borrowed funds 
when the marginal cost of needed wholesale funding is lower than the cost of raising this funding in the retail markets  we may supplement retail funding with external funding sources such as unsecured fed funds lines of credit with upstream correspondent banks ftn financial  m t bank  atlantic central banker s bank  community banker s bank secured advances with the fhlb of atlanta  which are collateralized by eligible one to four family residential mortgage loans  the home equity lines of credit portfolio  qualifying commercial real estate loans  and various securities 
cash may also be pledged as collateral 
secured line of credit with the fed discount window for use in borrowing funds up to days  using municipal securities as collateral 
brokered deposits  including cds and money market funds  provide a method to generate deposits quickly 
these deposits are strictly rate driven but often provide the most cost effective means of funding growth 
one way buy cdars funding a form of brokered deposits that has become a viable supplement to brokered deposits obtained directly 
in response to current economic conditions  management has performed an extensive review of our liquidity position 
we have identified alternative methods to reduce the pledges on securities in our investment portfolio 
throughout and into  management made the decision not to reinvest called investments 
the growth in deposits and decreased loan demand has also attributed to our increased liquidity position 
while management believes that the increased liquidity position is prudent in light of the current economic environment and the increased risk in our loan portfolio  the increased liquidity did have a direct impact on the net interest margin and earnings as compared to prior periods 
management believes that we have adequate liquidity available to respond to current and anticipated liquidity demands and is unaware of any trends or demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will materially affect our ability to maintain liquidity at satisfactory levels 
market risk and interest sensitivity our primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation 
interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities that we engage in  such as gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on our liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between interest bearing assets and liabilities 
management seeks to minimize fluctuating net interest margins  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
management uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage these risks 
the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date 
the differences between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than liabilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit us during a period of declining interest rates 
throughout  we shifted our focus to a shorter duration balance sheet demonstrating a more neutral to asset sensitive position as we anticipate a flat to rising rate environment in the future 
as of december   we were slightly liability sensitive 
our interest rate risk management goals are ensure that the boards of directors and senior management of first united corporation and the bank will provide effective oversight and ensure that risks are adequately identified  measured  monitored and controlled  enable dynamic measurement and management of interest rate risk  select strategies that optimize our ability to meet its long range financial goals while maintaining interest rate risk within policy limits established by the boards of directors  use both income and market value oriented techniques to select strategies that optimize the relationship between risk and return  and establish interest rate risk exposure limits for fluctuation in net interest income nii  net income and economic value of equity 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios 
key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in asset volumes and pricing  and management s capital plans 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net interest income over specified time periods 
we evaluate the effect of a change in interest rates of basis points to basis points on both nii and net portfolio value npv economic value of equity eve 
we concentrate on nii rather than net income as long as nii remains the significant contributor to net income 
nii modeling allows management to view how changes in interest rates will affect the spread between the yield paid on assets and the cost of deposits and borrowed funds 
unlike traditional gap modeling  nii modeling takes into account the different degree to which installments in the same repricing period will adjust to a change in interest rates 
it also allows the use of different assumptions in a falling versus a rising rate environment 
the period considered by the nii modeling is the next eight quarters 
npv eve modeling focuses on the change in the market value of equity 
npv eve is defined as the market value of assets less the market value of liabilities plus minus the market value of any off balance sheet positions 
by effectively looking at the present value of all future cash flows on or off the balance sheet  npv eve modeling takes a longer term view of interest rate risk 
this complements the shorter term view of the nii modeling 
measures of net interest income at risk produced by simulation analysis are indicators of an institution s short term performance in alternative rate environments 
these measures are typically based upon a relatively brief period  usually one year 
they do not necessarily indicate the long term prospects or economic value of the institution 
as a part of managing interest rate risk  the bank entered into interest rate swap agreements to modify the re pricing characteristics of certain interest bearing liabilities 
the bank has designated its interest rate swap agreements as cash flow hedges  which have the effective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative  net of taxes  recorded in net accumulated other comprehensive income 
in july  the bank entered into three interest rate swap contracts totaling million notional amount  hedging future cash flows associated with floating rate trust preferred debt 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was thousand 
at december   the fair value of the interest rate swap contracts was thousand 
there was no hedge ineffectiveness recorded for the year ended december  interest rate swap agreements are entered into with counterparties that meet established credit standards and the bank believes that the credit risk inherent in these contracts is not significant as of december  based on the simulation analysis performed at december  and  management estimated the following changes in net interest income  assuming the indicated rate changes dollars in thousands basis point increase basis point increase basis point increase basis point increase basis point increase this estimate is based on assumptions that may be affected by unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment and any number of unforeseeable factors 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between lending rates and rates paid on purchased funds are not constant over time 
management can respond to current or anticipated market conditions by lengthening or shortening the bank s sensitivity through loan repricings or changing its funding mix 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin 
impact of inflation our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  and as such  future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money 
during inflationary periods  monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains 
the concept of purchasing power is not an adequate indicator of the impact of inflation on financial institutions because it does not incorporate changes in interest rates  which are an important determination of the corporation s earnings
