item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
we make statements in this section that are forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws 
for a complete discussion of forward looking statements  see the section in this form k entitled forward looking statements 
certain risk factors may cause our actual results  performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the following discussion 
for a discussion of such risk factors  see the section in this report entitled risk factors 
when you read the financial statements and the information included in this report  you should be aware that our operations are significantly affected by both macro and micro economic forces 
our operations are directly affected by actual and perceived trends in various national and regional economic conditions that affect national and regional markets for commercial real estate services  including interest rates  the availability of credit to finance commercial real estate transactions  and the impact of tax laws affecting real estate 
periods of economic slowdown or recession  rising interest rates  tightening of the credit markets  declining demand for or increased supply of real estate  or the public perception that any of these events may occur can adversely affect our business 
these conditions could result in a general decline in rents  which in turn would reduce revenue from property management fees and brokerage commissions derived from leases 
in addition  these conditions could lead to a decline in property values as well as a decline in funds invested in commercial real estate and related assets  which in turn may reduce revenues from investment advisory  property management  leasing and development fees 
overview and background we are a full service real estate operating company that owns  acquires  develops and manages primarily office  as well as mixed use and residential properties on a nationwide basis 
we conduct our business through our operating partnership  of which we own as of december  and have control over the major decisions of the operating partnership 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the relevant reporting periods 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting estimates  as these policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
we believe the following accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
for a summary of significant accounting policies  see note to our financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
investments in real estate 
the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  the existence of above and below market tenant leases  the creditworthiness of the tenants  favorable or unfavorable financing  and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  any ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  tenant relationships  the value or negative value of above or below market leases and any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
our calculation methodology is summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these allocation 
table of contents assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases 
additionally  the amortization of value or negative value assigned to non market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 
we evaluate a property for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current book value of the property may not be recoverable 
indicators of potential impairment include among other things declining occupancy levels  declining rental rates  increasing number of tenants unable to pay their rent  deterioration in the local rental market  declining market values  our competitors beginning to experience financial difficulty or impair similar assets  and our inability or change of intent to hold the property 
in the event that these periodic assessments result in a determination that the carrying amount of a property exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest that are expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the property  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the property 
estimates of expected future net cash flows are inherently uncertain and are based on assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
these estimates are highly subjective and require us to make assumptions relating to  among other things future rental rates  tenant allowances  operating expenditures  property taxes  capital improvements  occupancy levels  the estimated proceeds generated from the future sale of the property or inability to sell the property  holding periods  market conditions  accessibility of capital and credit markets  recent sales activity of similar properties in the same market  our liquidity and ability and intent to hold the properties  development and construction costs  and discount rates 
these estimates can change significantly between reporting periods 
due to the fact that estimates included in cash flow models are based on historical results and projected trends  unexpected changes in market conditions may lead to additional impairment charges in the future that cannot be anticipated 
we use the equity method of accounting to account for investments in real estate entities over which we have significant influence  but not control over major decisions 
in these situations  the unit of account for measurement purposes is the equity investment and not the real estate 
accordingly  if our joint venture investments meet the other than temporary criteria of fasb asc  investments equity method and joint ventures  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of our investment 
with respect to condominium units held for sale  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell the project 
estimates of fair value are often based on expected future net cash flows  which are inherently uncertain and are based on assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the project 
these estimates require us to make assumptions relating to  among other things  sales absorption rates  selling prices and discount rates 
refer to the impairment loss discussion in the sections titled comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  and comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  found elsewhere herein for further information on the impairment losses recorded in those years 
revenue recognition 
leases with tenants are accounted for as operating leases 
rental income is recognized as earned based upon the contractual terms of the leases with tenants 
minimum annual rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term regardless of when the payments are made 
the deferred rents asset on our balance sheets represents the aggregate excess rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the cash received under the applicable lease provisions 
our leases generally contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate related taxes associated with the property 
these reimbursements are recognized as revenues in the period the related expenses are incurred 
real estate commissions on leases we charge to third party owners of rental properties are generally recorded as income after we satisfy all obligations under the commission agreement 
a typical commission agreement provides that we earn of the lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant 
the remaining of the lease commission is earned at a later date  usually upon tenant occupancy 
the existence of any significant future contingencies 
table of contents will delay recognition of commission revenue until those contingencies are satisfied 
in addition  we eliminate lease commissions we charge on our ownership share of rental properties 
investment advisory  property management and development services fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related agreements 
we have one high rise condominium project for which we used the percentage of completion accounting method to recognize costs and sales during the construction period  up through and including june  commencing with the third quarter of  we have applied the deposit method of accounting to recognize sales revenue and costs 
under the provisions of fasb asc  property  plant and equipment subsection real estate and sales  revenue and costs for projects are recognized when all parties are bound by the terms of the contract  all consideration has been exchanged  any permanent financing for which the seller is responsible has been arranged and all conditions precedent to closing have been performed 
this results in profit from the sale of condominium units recognized at the point of settlement as compared to the point of sale 
revenue is recognized on the contract price of individual units 
total estimated costs  net of impairment charges  are allocated to individual units which have closed on a relative value basis 
total estimated revenue and construction costs are reviewed periodically  and any change is applied to current and future periods 
allowances for uncollectible current tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rents receivable 
tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent receivables are carried net of the allowances for estimated uncollectible tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent 
our determination of the adequacy of these allowances requires significant judgments and estimates 
unbilled deferred rents receivable represents the amount that the cumulative straight line rental revenue recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the lease agreements 
given the longer term nature of these types of receivables  our determination of the adequacy of the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivables is based primarily on historical loss experience 
we evaluate the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivable using a specific identification methodology for our company s significant tenants  assessing a tenant s financial condition and the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations 
in addition  the allowance includes a reserve based upon our historical experience and current and anticipated future economic conditions that are not associated with any specific tenant 
depreciable lives of leasing costs 
we incur certain capital costs in connection with leasing our properties 
these costs consist primarily of lease commissions and tenant improvements 
lease costs are amortized on the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the estimated remaining term of the lease  ranging from one to years 
we reevaluate the remaining useful life of these costs as the creditworthiness of our tenants changes 
if we determine that the estimated remaining life of the respective lease has changed  we adjust the amortization period and  therefore  the amortization or depreciation expense recorded each period may fluctuate 
if we experience increased levels of amortization or depreciation expense due to changes in the estimated useful lives of leasing costs  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
income taxes 
we are subject to federal income taxes in the united states  and also in states and local jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to fasb asc  income taxes 
fasb asc requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
fasb asc  income taxes  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements if that position would more likely than not be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fasb asc topic  income taxes provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
asc topic also provides guidance on measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with asc topic and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
factors that may influence future results of operations the following is a summary of the more significant factors we believe may affect our results of operations 
for a more detailed discussion regarding the factors that you should consider before making a decision to acquire shares of our common stock  see the information under the caption risk factors elsewhere in this report 
rental income 
the amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain 
table of contents the occupancy rates of currently leased space  to lease currently available space as well as space in newly developed or redeveloped properties and space available from unscheduled lease terminations 
the amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in the submarkets where our properties are located 
los angeles  philadelphia  austin  and houston submarket information 
a significant portion of our income is derived from properties located in los angeles  philadelphia  austin and houston 
the market conditions in these submarkets have a significant impact on our results of operations 
development and redevelopment activities 
we believe that our development activities present growth opportunities for us over the next several years 
we continually evaluate the size  timing and scope of our development and redevelopment initiatives and  as necessary  sales activity to reflect the economic conditions and the real estate fundamentals that exist in our submarkets 
however  we may not be able to lease committed development or redevelopment properties at expected rental rates or within projected time frames or complete projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we currently own interests in four development projects  and tpg calstrs owns one redevelopment property and two development sites 
as of december   we had incurred  on a consolidated basis  approximately million of costs related to land acquisition  predevelopment and infrastructure that are reflected in land improvements development properties on our balance sheet 
to the extent that we  or joint ventures we are a partner in  do not proceed with projects as planned  development and or redevelopment costs would need to be evaluated for impairment 
results of operations the results of operations reflect the consolidation of the affiliates that own one commerce square  two commerce square  murano  jfk boulevard  four points centre  campus el segundo and our investment advisory  property management  leasing and real estate development operations 
included in our investment advisory  property management  leasing and development services operations are development fees we earn from unaffiliated third parties related to two separate entitlement projects universal village and wilshire grand

investment advisory  management  leasing and development services revenues 
this caption represents revenues earned from services provided to unaffiliated entities in which we have no ownership interest 
revenues from these services decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  primarily due to lower lease commission revenue of million relative to the prior period 
we also recognized million less fee revenue from the universal village entitlement project 
the decrease is partially offset by a fee we earned of million in connection with the successful completion of the city national plaza refinancing 
investment advisory  management  leasing and development services revenues unconsolidated real estate entities 
this caption represents revenues earned from services provided to entities for which we use the equity method to account for our ownership interest since we have significant influence  but not control  over the entities 
revenues from these services from unconsolidated real estate entities increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   primarily due an increase in leasing activity resulting in an increase in lease commission revenue 
reimbursement of property personnel costs 
this caption represents the reimbursement for property personnel salary  payroll taxes and benefits 
reimbursement revenue increased by million  or  from million for the year ended december   to million for the year ended december   primarily due to increased bonus compensation in condominium sales 
this caption represents the revenue recognized for murano condominium units and parking spaces 
the decrease of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is due to the sale of units in as compared to units in total expenses 
total expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the significant components of expense are discussed below 
rental property operating and maintenance expense 
property operating and maintenance expenses decreased by million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in contract cleaning expenses at commerce square 
real estate taxes 
real estate taxes decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december 
table of contents   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to special taxes associated with the murano recorded in with no comparable expense in  as well as a decrease in property tax expense related to a lower assessed value on our four points centre office buildings 
investment advisory  management  leasing and development services expenses 
expenses for these services increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of bad debt expense recognized in reimbursable property personnel costs 
this caption represents the reimbursement of property personnel salary  payroll taxes and benefits 
reimbursable expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to increased bonus compensation in cost of condominium sales 
the decrease of million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is due to fewer sales of units in compared to units in interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the payoff of mezzanine debt at two commerce square in december  which resulted in a decrease of million compared to the prior period 
interest expense also decreased at our murano and four points centre properties as a result of payments made which lowered the principal balances of the related mortgage loans 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily attributable to assets associated with our four points centre office buildings  which were placed in service in  and by tenant improvements written off early at one commerce square 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expense decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this was primarily due to a reduction in compensation expense as a result of cost saving measures 
impairment loss

the book carrying value of murano  net of the impairment charges  is reflective of the company estimation of future absorption rates and sales prices  which are supported by a third party appraisal 
if the actual absorption and sales prices are materially less than the projection  we could potentially need to record additional impairment in future periods 
gain on sale of real estate 
for the year ended december  we recognized a gain of million related to the sale of a acre land parcel adjacent to our four points development project 
there was no corresponding gain recognized in the year ended december  gain from early extinguishment of debt 
we repaid a loan from our former non controlling partner in campus el segundo during  resulting in the recognition of a gain on early extinguishment of debt of million related to this loan in the year ended december  there was no corresponding gain recognized in the year ended december  interest income 
interest income decreased by million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily attributable to lower average cash balances combined with a decrease in interest rates earned 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated real estate entities 
our share of the net loss of our unconsolidated real estate entities decreased by million  or  to a net loss of million for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  set forth below is a summary of the combined financial information for the unconsolidated real estate entities  our share of net loss and our equity in net loss  after intercompany eliminations  for the years ended december  and in thousands

the gain on early extinguishment of debt of million was related to the austin joint venture while the million recorded in was attributable to city national plaza  san felipe plaza  city west and centerpointe i ii 
provision benefit for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased by million or  to a benefit of million for the year ended december  compared to a provision of million for the year ended december  this change is attributable primarily to the current year reversal of million in accrued interest relating to unrecognized tax benefits for which the statute of limitations period has lapsed

tenant reimbursements 
tenant reimbursements decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily related to the scheduled expiration in june of the conrail lease at two commerce square 
approximately half or  rentable square feet expired in june and the remaining half expired in june this decrease in reimbursement revenue was offset by revenues from former subtenants that are now direct tenants or new tenants 
parking and other revenues

for the year ended december  we recognized revenue of million  based on the sale of units and parking spaces 
for the year ended december  we recognized revenue of million  based on the sale of units and parking spaces 
up to and including the quarter ended june   we accounted for units and parking spaces under contract of sale based on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
total expenses 
total expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the significant components of expense are discussed below 
rental property operating and maintenance expense 
rental property operating and maintenance expense remained consistent for each of the years ended december  and real estate taxes 
real estate taxes increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million was primarily the result of increased philadelphia business taxes assessed on the sales proceeds of the murano condominiums 
investment advisory  management  leasing and development services expenses 
these expenses decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   primarily due to a decrease in the use of consultants for system improvements and development services and a decrease in legal fees related to our formation of the green fund 
reimbursable property personnel costs 
this caption represents the reimbursement of property personnel salary  payroll taxes and benefits 
the decrease of million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  was primarily a result of paying the property level bonuses during which resulted in two years of bonus payments  both and  being included in but only one year of expense being included in cost of condominium sales 
the decrease of million is due to reduced sales of units during for the year ended december   we recognized costs of million  based on sales of units and parking spaces compared with million for the year ended december   based on sales of units and parking spaces 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million or to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense is primarily attributable to million in interest costs no longer being capitalized on murano and our four points centre office buildings due to the completion of development on these projects during the year ended december  offset primarily due to a decrease in interest expense relating to the murano of approximately million resulting from payments on of the construction loan 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the 
table of contents increase is partially attributable to the purchase of interests in one and two commerce square during the increase is also attributable to the completion of construction and opening of the marketing center at campus el segundo during general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to costs associated with the postponed equity offering during impairment loss 
we recognized an impairment charge related to our murano condominium project whose units are complete and held for sale of million for the year ended december  compared to an million impairment charge for the year ended december  we are required to record murano at its estimated fair value as it meets the held for sale criteria of fasb asc  property  plant and equipment 
these non cash impairment charges related to murano are included in the impairment loss line item in the consolidated statements of operations for the respective years 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge in accordance with the criteria of fasb asc  investments equity method and joint ventures for our investment in the austin joint venture  which is accounted for under the equity method  of million for the year ended december  compared to a million impairment charge for the year ended december  additionally  we recorded impairment charges related to certain of our other properties accounted for using the equity method of accounting 
our percent share of these impairment charges is as follows four falls corporate center of million  walnut hill plaza of million and centerpointe i ii of million 
there were no impairment charges recorded for these properties for the year ended december  these non cash impairment charges related to both our investment in the austin joint venture and other properties accounted for using the equity method are included in the equity in net loss of unconsolidated real estate entities line item in the consolidated statements of operations for the respective years 
as discussed in our critical accounting policies  the estimates of expected future net cash flows are inherently uncertain  and are based on assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the properties 
these estimates can change significantly between reporting periods 
due to the fact that estimates included in cash flow models are based on historical results and projected trends  unexpected changes in market conditions may lead to additional impairment charges in the future that cannot be anticipated 
our oak hill plaza property failed the undiscounted cash flows test at december  using a limited holding period in the test due to uncertainty regarding the maturing debt due in march the estimated fair market value for oak hill plaza exceeds the book carrying value  though  so there is no impairment loss 
additionally  the book carrying value of our murano project  net of the impairment charges recorded as of december   is reflective of the company estimation of future absorption rates and sales prices  which are supported by a third party appraisal 
if the actual absorption and sales prices are materially less than the projection  we could potentially need to record additional impairment in future periods 
gain on sale of real estate 
gain on sale of real estate decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  we recognized a gain of million related to the sale of a acre land parcel adjacent to our four points centre development project 
for the year ended december  we recognized a previously deferred gain of million related to the sale of a parcel of land at our campus el segundo development project 
a acre parcel at campus el segundo was sold in for million resulting in a total gain of million 
we were obligated to fund certain infrastructure improvements of approximately million with respect to the development of the sold parcel 
the remaining deferred gain was recognized upon completion of the remaining infrastructure improvements during the year ended december  interest income 
interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   due to declining investment balances and lower interest rates 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated real estate entities 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated real estate entities increased by million  or  to a net loss of million for the year ended december  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  set forth below is a summary of the combined financial information for the unconsolidated real estate entities and our share of net loss and equity in net loss for the years ended december  and in thousands

provision benefit for income taxes 
provision for income taxes decreased by million  or  to a provision of million for the year ended december  compared to a benefit of million for the year ended december  this change is attributable primarily to the company recording a valuation allowance of million in liquidity and capital resources analysis of liquidity and capital resources as of december   we have unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million 
we believe that we will have sufficient capital to satisfy our liquidity needs over the next months through working capital 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  including debt service  property acquisitions and additional future development and redevelopment activity  through cash flow from operations  additional secured and unsecured long term borrowings  dispositions of non strategic assets  and the potential issuance of additional debt  or common or preferred equity securities  including convertible securities 
during the year ended december   we sold million shares of common stock at prices ranging from to per share in our at the market equity offering program 
these sales resulted in net proceeds of million  which are being used for general corporate purposes 
assuming the exercise of extension options available to us  there is no debt maturing in our portfolio until with respect to debt maturing in and thereafter  we will seek to refinance this debt at maturity or retire it through the issuance of securities  as market conditions permit 
there can be no assurances that such debt refinancing will be available at the time of such maturities on acceptable terms  if at all  and our cost of capital could increase as a result of any such debt refinancing 
if we are unable to obtain debt refinancing for properties in which we own an interest at maturity  we may lose some or all of our equity interests in such properties 
additionally  existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution in the event we are required to issue additional equity capital 
as indicated in the table below under the caption contractual obligations  upon exercise of extension options  we have million of scheduled principal payments on consolidated debt remaining in and million in we believe that we have sufficient capital to satisfy these payments 
see contractual obligations and the corresponding notes to the table thereunder for further detail 
with respect to the debt owed by our unconsolidated real estate entities  upon exercise of extension options  there are no remaining maturity dates in and no additional principal payments due in see off balance sheet arrangements indebtedness of unconsolidated real estate entities 
on march   an aggregate of million in mortgage loans owed by subsidiaries of tpg calstrs the 
table of contents borrowers on unconsolidated properties at four falls corporate center  oak hill plaza and walnut hill plaza matured and became due in full 
the borrowers elected not to make payment on these loans and they are currently in default 
these loans are non recourse to the borrowers and the company  both of which do not anticipate making any payments or equity contributions to support the repayment or refinancing of these loans 
the borrowers are currently in discussions with the special servicer regarding a cooperative resolution on each of these assets including the likely appointment of a receiver and the judicial transfer of the properties 
we do not believe that the loss of our equity interests in these properties will have a material effect on our business or results of operations 
as of december   we have unfunded capital commitments to our joint venture with calstrs of million  and the thomas high performance green fund the green fund of million 
with respect to our joint venture with calstrs  we are not obligated to fund our share of the capital commitment for the acquisition of any new project  but we are obligated to fund tenant improvements and other capital improvements for projects that were acquired prior to june  we estimate we will fund million between and to cover our share of contractual obligations existing at december  for capital improvements  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
our requirement to fund all or a portion of our commitments to the green fund is subject to our identifying properties to acquire at our discretion 
our cash requirements for the green fund could be reduced by contributions by us to the fund of assets in which we have an interest 
the green fund original investment period expired in december  which we extended together with an institutional investor to december calstrs is no longer a partner in the green fund 
in december  our board of directors suspended its quarterly dividends to common stockholders 
the availability of funds to pay dividends is impacted by property level restrictions on cash flows 
with respect to our joint venture properties  we do not solely control decision making with respect to these properties  and may not be able to obtain monies from these properties even if funds are available for distribution to us 
in addition  we may enter future financing arrangements that contain restrictions on our use of cash generated from our properties 
the payment of cash dividends in the future  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon such factors as earnings levels  capital requirements  our overall financial condition  and any other factors deemed relevant by our board of directors 
development and redevelopment projects we own interests in four development projects  and our joint venture with calstrs includes one redevelopment property and two development sites 
we anticipate seeking to mitigate our development risk on all of our development projects by obtaining significant pre leasing and guaranteed maximum cost construction contracts 
there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully implement these risk mitigation measures 
we completed construction of the murano  a unit high rise residential condominium project in downtown philadelphia in september we have closed sales on units as of december  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge for the year ended december  on the murano based on our estimation of future absorption and sales prices 
during the year ended december   we entered into contracts for units and parking spaces  had no forfeitures and recognized a gain on sale of approximately million 
murano is classified as condominium units held for sale on our balance sheet 
the amount and timing of costs associated with our development and redevelopment projects is inherently uncertain due to market and economic conditions 
we presently intend to fund development and redevelopment expenditures primarily through construction or refurbishment financing 
construction of the murano was financed in part with a construction loan up to million 
repayment of this loan is being made with proceeds from the sales of condominium units 
the loan has a balance of million as of december  on july   the company extended the murano construction loan with the lender  for one year to july   with the right to two six month extensions 
the loan will bear interest at the greater of or three month libor plus 
we have no guarantees on this debt other than the payment of interest through the maturity date 
both six month extensions require payment of an extension fee equal to of the unpaid principal balance as of july  and january   respectively 
the first six month extension is also subject to a loan exposure measurement whereby the outstanding principal balance of the loan divided by saleable square footage of the units yet to settle shall be no greater than per saleable square foot 
if the loan exposure measurement is not met  then the borrower must make a payment to achieve the per saleable square foot requirement to qualify for the extension 
if the rebalancing had been done as of december  based on the number of units yet to settle as of december   the loan balance would need to be reduced from million to million to meet the loan exposure limitation 
the completed core and shell construction of two office buildings at our development site at four points centre was financed in part with a construction loan  which has an outstanding balance as of december  of million with additional borrowing capacity of million to fund tenant improvements and other project costs

we paid down the principal amount of the loan by million during the year ended december  the interest rate on the loan is libor plus per annum 
additionally  we have guaranteed of the balance of the outstanding principal  interest and any other sum payable under this loan  which results in a maximum guarantee amount of million 
we also provided collateral of approximately acres of fully entitled unimproved land  which is immediately adjacent to our four points centre office buildings 
as of may   if the four points centre office buildings are not at least leased on terms consistent with the appraisal pro forma  we must pre fund months of interest into a restricted cash account with the lender  if the buildings are less than leased at that time  we will also have to pay million as a principal reduction of the loan 
we have a mortgage loan on our campus el segundo project in the amount of million 
presently  we have not obtained construction financing for this development project 
if we finance development projects through construction loans and are unable to obtain permanent financing on advantageous terms or at all  we would need to fund these obligations from cash flow from operations or seek alternative capital sources 
if unsuccessful  this could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations 
if we are successful in obtaining construction or refurbishment financing and permanent financing  we anticipate that the corresponding interest costs would represent both a significant use of our cash flow and a material component of our results of operations 
we are also involved in managing the following three entitlement projects we are entitling approximately acres in los angeles  california  for office  production facility  residential and retail uses 
the project  called metro studio lankershim  will include up to approximately million square feet 
upon completion of entitlements  we expect to enter into a long term ground lease with the los angeles county metropolitan transportation authority  which owns the land  depending on nbcu space requirements for the project 
under our contract with nbcu for the universal studios hollywood backlot entitlement  we have a right of first offer rofo to develop approximately acres for residential and related retail and community serving uses 
we are pursuing environmental clearance and governmental approvals for approximately  residential units and  square feet of retail and community serving space 
upon successful completion of the entitlement process and our exercise of the rofo  it is anticipated this project will be developed in phases over several years  subject to market conditions 
korean air  a subsidiary of hanjin group  has retained us as fee developer for the entitlement  design and redevelopment of the acre wilshire grand property in downtown los angeles 
the wilshire grand project envisions the development of two buildings  one approximately stories and the other approximately stories  to include approximately million square feet of office  hotel rooms  and up to residential condominiums  with supporting retail and restaurant uses  for a total project size of up to approximately million gross square feet 
leasing  tenant improvement and capital needs in addition to our development and redevelopment projects  our one commerce square and two commerce square properties require capital maintenance and expenditures for leasing commissions and tenant improvement costs 
the level of these expenditures varies from year to year based on several factors  including lease expirations 
we are contractually committed to incur expenditures of approximately million in capital improvements  tenant improvements  and leasing commissions for the one commerce square and two commerce square properties  collectively  during through additionally  we expect to expend additional amounts in connection with a value enhancement program at commerce square 
the funding for both the million of existing commitments and future expenditures under the value enhancement program are discussed in the paragraph below 
during november  subsidiaries of tpg and brandywine entered into two partnerships with respect to our one commerce square and two commerce square properties 
brandywine contributed capital of million at closing with the balance to be contributed by december   totaling million of preferred equity in return for a limited partnership interest in each property 
the preferred equity will be invested in a value enhancement program designed to increase rental rates and occupancy at commerce square 
annual capital expenditures may fluctuate in response to the nature  extent and timing of improvements required to maintain our properties 
tenant improvements and leasing costs may also fluctuate depending upon other factors  including the type of property involved  the existing tenant base  terms of leases  types of leases  the involvement of leasing agents and overall market conditions

subsidiaries of tpg calstrs the borrowers elected not to repay the loans by the maturity date of march  and therefore  the loans are in default 
we are in discussions with the special servicer regarding a cooperative resolution on each of these assets  including the likely appointment of a receiver and the judicial transfer of the properties

due to the maturity date default  the lender has the authority to terminate us as the property manager

table of contents represented a decrease of million from the net cash used in operations of million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of million in the net loss 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities decreased by million to million provided by investing activities for the year ended december  compared to million provided by investing activities for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily the result of fewer proceeds from the sale of murano condominium units of million offset by lower expenditures for real estate improvements of million 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to million utilized in financing activities for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of a reduction of principal payments on mortgages and other secured loans of million 
the reduced payments result from lower payments on the murano loan of million due to fewer unit settlements in  the payoff of an unsecured loan related to our campus el segundo project of million in there were no loan payments in on this project  and a decrease in payments of million on two commerce square as a result of the mezzanine loan payoff in the increase was offset by a decrease of million related to proceeds from mortgages and other secured loans

the increase was offset by a decrease of million related to principal payments of mortgage and other secured loans  million in proceeds from a registered direct equity offering during the year ended december  and a decrease of million related to the payment of dividends to common stockholders and distributions to limited partners of the operating partnership 
inflation substantially all of our office leases provide for tenants to reimburse us for increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses related to the leased space at the applicable property 
in addition  many of the leases provide for increases in fixed base rent 
we believe that inflationary increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses may be partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense reimbursements as described above 
we have one multi family residential rental property  which is located in the philadelphia central business district and subject to short term leases 
inflationary increases can often be offset by increased rental rates  however  a weak economic environment may restrict our ability to raise rental rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a primary market risk faced by our company is interest rate risk 
our strategy is to match as closely as possible the expected holding periods and income streams of our assets with the terms of our debt 
in general  we use floating rate debt on assets with higher growth prospects and less stability to their income streams 
correspondingly  with respect to stabilized assets with lower growth rates  we will generally use longer term fixed rate debt 
as of december   our company had 
table of contents million of outstanding consolidated floating rate debt  which is not subject to an interest rate cap 
the unconsolidated real estate entities have total debt  excluding loans on properties subject to special servicer oversight  of billion  of which billion bears interest at floating rates 
as of december   interest rate caps have been purchased for billion of the floating rate loans 
our fixed and variable rate consolidated long term debt at december  consisted of the following in thousands year of maturity fixed rate variable rate total thereafter total weighted average interest rate we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect on interest costs of our variable rate debt 
at december   our variable rate long term debt represents of our total long term debt 
if interest rates were to increase by basis points  or by approximately of the weighted average variable rate at december   the net impact would be increased interest costs of million per year 
our estimates of the fair value of debt instruments at december  and  respectively  were determined by performing discounted cash flow analyses using an appropriate market discount rate 
considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop the estimated fair value 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
as of december  and  the estimated fair value of our mortgage and other secured loans and unsecured loan aggregates million and million  respectively  compared to the aggregate carrying value of million and million  respectively
