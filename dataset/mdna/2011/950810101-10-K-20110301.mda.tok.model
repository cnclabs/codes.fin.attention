item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  of this report 
market risk the primary objective of wesbanco s alco is to maximize net interest income within established policy parameters 
this objective is accomplished through the management of balance sheet composition  market risk exposures arising from changing economic conditions and liquidity risk 
market risk is defined as the risk of loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments resulting from fluctuations in interest rates and equity prices 
management considers interest rate risk to be wesbanco s most significant market risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure to adverse changes in net interest income due to changes in interest rates 
the relative consistency of wesbanco s net interest income is largely dependent on effective management of interest rate risk 
as interest rates change in the market  rates earned on interest rate sensitive assets and rates paid on interest rate sensitive liabilities do not necessarily move concurrently 
differing rate sensitivities may arise because fixed rate assets and liabilities may not have the same maturities  or because variable rate assets and liabilities differ in the timing and or the percentage of rate changes 
wesbanco s alco  comprised of senior management from various functional areas  monitors and manages interest rate risk within board approved policy limits 
interest rate risk is monitored primarily through the use of an earnings simulation model 
the model is highly dependent on various assumptions  which change regularly as the balance sheet and market interest rates change 
the key assumptions and strategies employed are analyzed bi monthly and reviewed and documented by the alco 
the earnings simulation model projects changes in net interest income resulting from the effect of changes in interest rates 
forecasting changes in net interest income requires management to make certain assumptions regarding loan and security prepayment rates  bond call dates  and adjustments to non maturing deposit rates  which may not necessarily reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
assumptions used are based primarily on historical experience and current market rates 
security portfolio maturities and prepayments are assumed to be reinvested in similar instruments and callable bond forecasts are adjusted at varying levels of interest rates 
while management believes such assumptions to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates  callable bond forecasts and non maturing 
table of contents deposit rates will approximate actual future results 
moreover  the net interest income sensitivity chart presented in table  net interest income sensitivity  assumes the composition of interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of the period remains constant over the period being measured and also assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve  regardless of the duration of the maturity or re pricing of specific assets and liabilities 
since the assumptions used in the model relative to changes in interest rates are uncertain  the simulation analysis may not be indicative of actual results 
in addition  the analysis may not consider all actions that management could employ in response to changes in interest rates and various earning asset and costing liability balances 
management is aware of the significant effect inflation or deflation has upon interest rates and ultimately upon financial performance 
wesbanco s ability to cope with inflation or deflation is best determined by analyzing its capability to respond to changing market interest rates  as well as its ability to manage the various elements of noninterest income and expense during periods of increasing or decreasing inflation or deflation 
wesbanco monitors the level and mix of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities through alco in order to reduce the impact of inflation or deflation on net interest income 
management also controls the effects of inflation or deflation by conducting periodic reviews of the prices and terms of its various products and services  both in terms of the costs to offer the services as well as outside market influences upon such pricing  by introducing new products and services or reducing the availability of existing products and services  and by controlling overhead expenses 
interest rate risk policy limits are determined by measuring the anticipated change in net interest income over a twelve month period assuming an immediate and sustained and basis point increase or decrease in market interest rates as compared to a stable rate environment or base model 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to a reduction of and or less  respectively  of net interest income from the base model over a twelve month period 
the table below shows wesbanco s interest rate sensitivity at december  and december  assuming both a and basis point interest rate change  compared to a base model 
due to the current low interest rate environment  particularly for short term rates  the basis point decreasing change is not calculated  and instead a basis point rising rate environment is shown 
the policy limit for an increasing basis point rising rate environment is a negative 
table net interest income sensitivity immediate change in interest rates basis points percentage change in net interest income from base over one year alco guidelines december  december  n a n a as per the table above  the earnings simulation model at december  currently projects that net interest income for the next twelve month period would decrease by if interest rates were to fall immediately by basis points  compared to a decrease of for the same scenario as of december  for rising rate scenarios  net interest income would increase by  and if rates increased by  and basis points  respectively  as of december  as compared to a decrease of  and in a  and basis point increasing rate environment as of december  in  the balance sheet has become more asset sensitive as compared to prior periods  although it is still anticipated that in a rapidly rising rate environment  the increase in net interest income would be lower than in a slower  more gradual increasing rate environment 
this is primarily due to an anticipation of slowing prepayment speeds and the extension risk associated with certain asset types  primarily residential mortgages and mortgage backed 
table of contents securities  having a greater impact in a basis point and above rising rate environment  net of the impact of lagging deposit rates in rising interest rate environments 
of note  mortgage instruments  both loans and securities  generally exhibit a propensity to prepay at faster speeds during periods of decreasing rates  and at slower speeds when rates increase 
a large percentage of our commercial loans written in the last two years in the low interest rate environment have had floor features 
variable rate commercial loans with rate floors approximated million at december   with an average floor of  which represented approximately of variable rate commercial loans 
the decrease in liability sensitivity between december  and december  was a result of changes in balance sheet composition primarily as certain borrowings and short term cd s matured and were paid off during late and throughout  as well as additional short term cash generated from increasing deposits  primarily mmda type accounts 
such cash generated in has been used to pay down million in fhlb maturing borrowings 
also  at the parent  a million trust preferred security was paid off with available cash in september 
while the bank has been focused on reducing its funding costs  both in deposits and short term borrowings in order to improve the net interest margin  a lengthening of maturity in certain cdars type cds also improved the former liability sensitivity position 
also  the continued reduction in fixed rate  longer term residential mortgages  as the bank sells most of its current fixed rate production into the secondary market  mitigates overall liability sensitivity 
wesbanco s alco expects  absent any other management actions  that its net interest margin may be slightly negatively impacted in coming quarters by maintaining greater bank liquidity and reinvesting cash flows from loans and investments at lower rates  along with funding floors 
rate increases are not currently anticipated in the near term  and as noted above an extended period of lower rates would likely result in a lower net interest margin 
the bank has significant additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb of pittsburgh  the federal reserve bank of cleveland  and various correspondent banks  and will continue to utilize these funding sources as necessary to mitigate the impact on our balance sheet of embedded options in commercial and residential loans and to lengthen liabilities to help offset mismatches in various asset maturities 
various derivative strategies may also be employed to enhance asset sensitivity in a rising rate environment  including loan level interest rate swaps for certain of our commercial loan customers  although such strategies would most likely result in a decrease to net interest income in the short term in order to improve net interest income in a longer term rising rate environment 
as an alternative to the immediate rate shock analysis  the alco monitors interest rate risk by ramping or increasing interest rates basis points gradually over a twelve month period 
wesbanco s current policy limits this exposure to of net interest income from the base model for a twelve month period 
management believes that the ramping analysis reflects a more realistic movement of interest rates  whereas the immediate rate shock reflects a less likely scenario 
the simulation model at december   using the basis point increasing rate ramp analysis  projects that net interest income would increase over the next twelve months  compared to a increase at december  wesbanco also periodically measures the economic value of equity  which is defined as the market value of equity in various increasing and decreasing rate scenarios 
at december   the market value of equity as a percent of base in a basis point rising rate environment indicates an increase of as compared to a decrease of at december  in a basis point falling rate environment  the model indicates a decrease of  as compared to a decrease of as of december  wesbanco s policy is to limit such change to minus for a basis point change in interest rates  as long as the tier i capital leverage ratio is not forecasted to decrease below as a result of the change
