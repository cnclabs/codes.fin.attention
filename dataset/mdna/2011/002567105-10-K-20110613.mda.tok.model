we offer the following two vetscan rapid tests  which deliver easy to read results in approximately ten minutes  as described below 
canine heartworm rapid test in january  we introduced the vetscan canine heartworm rapid test  a highly sensitive and specific test for the detection of dirofilaria immitis in canine whole blood  serum or plasma 
the lateral flow immunoassay technology in the canine heartworm rapid tests provides immediate results 

table of contents canine parvovirus rapid test in march  we introduced the vetscan canine parvovirus rapid test kit  a qualitative test for the detection of canine parvovirus antigen in feces 
the vetscan canine parvovirus rapid test kit uses a unique combination of monoclonal antibodies that provides the detection of parvovirus antigen  allowing the veterinarian to screen for and diagnose the infection 
in may  we entered into an exclusive agreement with abbott point of care inc abbott  granting us the right to sell and distribute abbott s i stat handheld instrument i stat analyzer and associated consumables for blood gas  electrolyte  basic blood chemistry and immunoassay testing in the animal health care market worldwide 
our right to sell and distribute these products was initially non exclusive  but became exclusive in all countries of the world  except for japan  in november our rights in japan remain non exclusive for the term of the agreement

we started marketing and sales activities of the i stat cartridges in the first quarter of fiscal in the second quarter of fiscal  we started marketing and sales activities of the i stat instrument 
we launched an abaxis branded version of the i stat instrument as part of our vetscan line in the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal  we began developing a full service laboratory testing facility  abaxis veterinary reference laboratories avrl  which will be located in olathe  kansas 
avrl will provide veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services for veterinarians in the united states 
avrl will also focus on providing specialty and esoteric testing and analysis 
additionally  in january  we formed a strategic alliance with kansas state university  k state veterinary diagnostic lab  and a commercial affiliate of kansas state university  the national institute for strategic technology acquisition and commercialization  to enable avrl to provide a full service commercial laboratory for veterinarians 
our sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty  and may depend on a number of factors outside of our control  including but not limited to inventory or timing considerations by our distributors 
we generally operate with a limited order backlog because our products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received 
product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
as a result  any such revenue shortfall would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our sales may be adversely impacted by pricing pressure from competitors 
our ability to be consistently profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase the sales volumes of our piccolo and vetscan products and to successfully compete with other competitors 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful indicators of future results 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and the sensitivity of these estimates to deviations in the assumptions used in making them 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical because they are not only important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations  but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue 
our primary customers are distributors and direct customers in both the medical and veterinary markets 
revenues from product sales  net of estimated sales allowances and rebates  are recognized when i evidence of an arrangement exists  ii upon shipment of the products to the customer  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
rights of return are not provided 
we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contract 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or non current deferred revenue liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
we provide incentives in the form of free goods or extended maintenance agreements to customers in connection with the sale of our instruments 
revenues from such sales are allocated separately to the instruments and incentives based on the residual value of each element 
revenues allocated to incentives are deferred until the goods are shipped to the customer or are recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract 
at march   and  the current portion of deferred revenue balances was  million and million  respectively  and the non current portion of deferred revenue balances was million  million and million  respectively 
the fluctuation in balances is due to the types of customer incentives programs offered during the period and depends on when the free goods are shipped to the customer and the maintenance period of the maintenance agreements 

table of contents we periodically offer trade in programs to customers for trading in an existing instrument to purchase a new instrument and we will either provide incentives in the form of free goods or reduce the sales price of the instrument 
these incentives in the form of free goods are recorded according to the policies described above 
we periodically offer programs to customers whereby certain instruments are made available to customers for rent or on an evaluation basis 
these programs typically require customers to purchase a minimum quantity of consumables during a specified period for which we recognize revenue on the related consumables according to the policies described above 
depending on the program offered  customers may purchase the instrument during the rental or evaluation period 
proceeds from such sale are recorded as revenue according to the policies described above 
rental income  if any  are also recorded as revenue according to the policies described above 
royalties are typically based on licensees net sales of products that utilize our technology and are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured  such as upon the receipt of a royalty statement from the licensee 
our royalty revenue depends on the licensees use of our technology  and therefore  may vary from period to period and impact our revenues during a quarter 
on june   we notified cepheid that cepheid breached its license agreement with us due to cepheid s discontinuation of license royalty payments 
on october   we informed cepheid that the breach had not been cured  and we terminated the entire license  as to all or any cepheid products 
as a result of the license termination  our development and licensing revenue was adversely and materially impacted in our consolidated financial statements during fiscal also  we expect the license termination will adversely and materially impact development and licensing revenue in our consolidated financial statements in the foreseeable future 
distributor and customer rebates 
we offer distributor pricing rebates and customer incentives  such as cash rebates  from time to time 
the distributor pricing rebates are offered to distributors upon meeting the sales volume requirements during a qualifying period and are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues during a qualifying period 
cash rebates are offered to distributors or customers who purchase certain products or instruments during a promotional period and are recorded as a reduction to gross revenues 
the distributor pricing rebate program is offered to distributors in the north america veterinary market  upon meeting the sales volume requirements of veterinary products during the qualifying period 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of products sold subject to a rebate during the qualifying period and which rebate percentage applies 
based on these factors and using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid and record the liability as a reduction to gross revenues when we record the sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate accruals from the date of sale ranges from one to nine months after sale 
changes in the rebate accrual at each fiscal year end are based upon distributors meeting the purchase requirements during the quarter 
other rebate programs offered to distributors or customers vary from period to period in the medical and veterinary markets 
the following table summarizes the change in total accrued distributor and customer rebates in thousands balance at beginning of year provisions payments balance at end of year year ended march  year ended march  year ended march  allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of the amounts owed to us by our customers 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers which is mostly determined by the customer s payment history and the outstanding period of accounts 
we specifically identify amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted accordingly 
an additional allowance is recorded based on certain percentages of our aged receivables  using historical experience to estimate the potential uncollectible and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required  which could adversely affect our operating income 

table of contents fair value measurements 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
financial accounting standards board the fasb accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements and disclosures  establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from independent sources observable inputs and an entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
the fair value hierarchy consists of three broad levels  which gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are described below level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
as of march   we used level assumptions for our cash equivalents  which are traded in an active market 
the valuations are based on quoted prices of the underlying security that are readily and regularly available in an active market  and accordingly  a significant degree of judgment is not required 
level directly or indirectly observable inputs as of the reporting date through correlation with market data  including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and quoted prices in markets that are not active 
level also includes assets and liabilities that are valued using models or other pricing methodologies that do not require significant judgment since the input assumptions used in the models  such as interest rates and volatility factors  are corroborated by readily observable data from actively quoted markets for substantially the full term of the financial instrument 
as of march   we did not have any level financial assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market data and require the use of significant management judgment 
these values are generally determined using pricing models for which the assumptions utilize management s estimates of market participant assumptions 
as of march   we did not have any level financial assets or liabilities 
fair value is a market based measure considered from the perspective of a market participant who holds the asset or owes the liability rather than an entity specific measure 
therefore  even when market assumptions are not readily available  our own assumptions are developed to reflect those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
at march   our short term investments totaled million and our long term investments totaled million  which were classified as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost 
investment in unconsolidated affiliate 
in february  we purchased a equity ownership interest in scandinavian micro biodevices aps smb  for million in cash 
we use the equity method to account for our investment in this entity that we do not control  but where we have the ability to exercise significant influence 
equity method investments are recorded at original cost and adjusted periodically to recognize our proportionate share of the investees net income or losses after the date of investment  additional contributions made and dividends or distributions received  and impairment losses resulting from adjustments to net realizable value 
we eliminate all intercompany transactions in accounting for our equity method investments 
during fiscal  we recorded our proportionate share of the investees net income or losses in interest and other income expense  net on the consolidated statements of income 
we assess the potential impairment of our equity method investments when indicators such as a history of operating losses  a negative earnings and cash flow outlook  and the financial condition and prospects for the investee s business segment might indicate a loss in value 
we did not recognize any impairment loss on investment in unconsolidated affiliate during fiscal warranty reserves 
we provide for the estimated future costs to be incurred under our standard warranty obligation on our instruments 
our standard warranty obligation on instruments ranges from one to three years 
the estimated contractual warranty obligation is recorded when the related revenue is recognized and any additional amount is recorded when such cost is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
cost of revenues reflects estimated warranty expense for instruments sold in the current period and any adjustments in estimated warranty expense for the installed base under our standard warranty obligation based on our quarterly evaluation of service experience 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our estimated accrual for warranty exposure is based on our historical experience as to product failures  estimated product failure rates  estimated repair costs  material usage and freight incurred in repairing the instrument after failure and known design changes under the warranty plan 
a provision for defective reagent discs is recorded when the related sale is recognized and any additional amount is recorded when such cost is probable and can be reasonably estimated  at which time they are included in cost of revenues 
the warranty cost includes the replacement costs and freight of a defective reagent disc 

table of contents as of march   our current portion of warranty reserves for instruments and reagent discs totaled million and our non current portion of warranty reserves for instruments totaled  which reflects our estimate of warranty obligations based on the estimated product failure rates  the number of instruments in standard warranty  estimated repair and related costs of instruments  and an estimate of defective reagent discs and replacement and related costs of a defective reagent disc 
each quarter  we reevaluate our estimate of warranty reserves  including our assumptions 
during fiscal and  we recorded an adjustment to pre existing warranties of  and  respectively  which reduced our warranty reserves and our cost of revenues  based on both a decrease in our historical experience as to product failures and our judgment of a decrease in estimated product failure rates of instruments 
we began experiencing a decrease in the estimated product failure rates since we began taking steps to resolve manufacturing problems on blood chemistry analyzers primarily from fiscal related to quality control for key components that we obtain from our suppliers and to design issues of the key components required and accordingly  starting in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded adjustments to our estimated accrual for warranty exposure based on our quarterly evaluation of service experience 
we review the historical warranty cost trends and analyze the adequacy of the ending accrual balance of warranty reserves each quarter 
the determination of warranty reserves requires us to make estimates of the estimated product failure rate  expected costs to repair or replace the instruments and to replace defective reagent discs under warranty 
if actual repair or replacement costs of instruments or replacement costs of reagent discs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to cost of revenues may be required 
additionally  if factors change and we revise our assumptions on the product failure rate of instruments or reagent discs  then our warranty reserves and cost of revenues could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using standard costs which approximate actual costs using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories include material  labor and overhead 
we establish provisions for excess  obsolete and unusable inventories after evaluation of future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management or if a significant amount of the material were to become unusable  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on our operating income 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  such as property and equipment and amortized intangible assets  whenever events or changes in business circumstances or our planned use of long lived assets indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable or their useful lives are no longer appropriate 
we look to current and future profitability  as well as current and future undiscounted cash flows  excluding financing costs  as primary indicators of recoverability 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal is less than the carrying amount 
if impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value and long lived assets are written down to their respective fair values 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes using the liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be recovered 
we recognize and measure benefits for uncertain tax positions using a two step approach 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return by determining if the weight of evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon audit  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes 
for tax positions that are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit  the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon settlement 
significant judgment is required to evaluate uncertain tax positions 
at march  and  we had no uncertain tax positions 
our policy is to include interest and penalties related to gross unrecognized tax benefits within our provision for income taxes 
for fiscal  and  we did not recognize any interest or penalties related to uncertain tax positions in the consolidated statements of income  and at march  and  we had no accrued interest or penalties 
share based compensation expense 
we recognize share based compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  over the requisite service period of the award to employees and directors 
there were no stock options granted since the beginning of fiscal and we did not grant stock options during fiscal  or for stock options granted prior to march   we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires highly subjective assumptions  including risk free interest rate  expected stock price volatility  expected term and expected dividends 

table of contents for restricted stock units  share based compensation expense is based on the fair value of our stock at the grant date and recognized net of an estimated forfeiture rate  over the requisite service period of the award 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
as required by fair value provisions of share based compensation  employee share based compensation expense recognized is calculated over the requisite service period of the awards and reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical data of our share based compensation awards that are granted and cancelled prior to vesting and upon historical experience of employee turnover 
changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant  unanticipated increases or decreases in share based compensation expense from period to period 
to the extent we revise our estimate of the forfeiture rate in the future  our share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
share based compensation expense resulted in a material impact on our earnings per share and on our consolidated financial statements for fiscal  and the impact of share based compensation expense on our consolidated financial results is disclosed in note  share based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
as of march   our unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted stock unit awards granted to employees and directors to date totaled million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average service period of years 
we expect that share based compensation will materially impact our consolidated financial statements in the foreseeable future 
excluding forfeitures  we estimate expense recognition of restricted stock units over the requisite service period of the award  for awards granted and unvested as of march  as follows million in fiscal  million in fiscal  million in fiscal and  in fiscal results of operations abaxis develops  manufactures  markets and sells portable blood analysis systems for use in the human or veterinary patient care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements

foreign currency denominated account balances of our subsidiary are remeasured into us dollars at the end of period exchange rates for monetary assets and liabilities  and historical exchange rates for nonmonetary assets 
accordingly  the effects of foreign currency transactions  and of remeasuring the financial condition into the functional currency  resulted in foreign currency gains and losses  which were included in interest and other income expense  net on our consolidated statements of income 
for our sales denominated in foreign currencies  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenue and collection of receivables 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro currency  the translation of the foreign currency denominated transactions may result in reduced cost of revenues and operating expenses 
similarly  our cost of revenues and operating expenses will increase if the us dollar weakens against the euro currency
