item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements about our business and operations 
our actual results may differ materially from those we currently anticipate as a result of the factors we describe under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a comprehensive provider of a broad range of social and medical services in the home 
our services include personal care and assistance with activities of daily living  skilled nursing and rehabilitative therapies  and adult day care 
our consumers are individuals with special needs who are at risk of hospitalization or institutionalization  such as the elderly  chronically ill and disabled 
our payor clients include federal  state and local governmental agencies  commercial insurers  and private individuals 
we provide our services through over locations across states to over  consumers 
we operate our business through two segments  home community services and home health services 
our home community services are social  or non medical  in nature and include assistance with bathing  grooming  dressing  personal hygiene and medication reminders  and other activities of daily living 
we provide home community services on a long term  continuous basis  with an average duration of months per consumer 
our home health services are primarily medical in nature and include physical  occupational and speech therapy  as well as skilled nursing 
we generally provide home health services on a short term  intermittent or episodic basis to individuals recovering from an acute medical condition  with an average length of care of days 
the comprehensive nature of our social and medical services enables us to maintain a long term relationship with our consumers as their needs change over time and provides us with diversified sources of revenue 
to meet our consumers changing needs  we utilize an integrated service delivery model approach that allows our consumers to access social and medical services from one homecare provider and appeals to referral sources who are seeking a provider with a breadth of services  scale and systems to meet consumers needs effectively 
our integrated service delivery model enables our consumers to access services from both our home community services and home health services divisions  thereby receiving the full spectrum of their social and medical homecare service needs from a single provider 
our integrated service model is designed to reduce service duplication  which lowers health care costs  enhances consumer outcomes and satisfaction and lowers our operating costs  as well as drives our internal growth strategy 
in our target markets  our care and service coordinators work with our caregivers  consumers and their providers to review our consumers current and anticipated service needs and  based on this continuous review  identify areas of service duplication or new service opportunities 
our ability to grow our net service revenues is closely correlated with the number of consumers to whom we provide our services 
our continued growth depends on our ability to maintain our existing payor client relationships  establish relationships with new payors  enter into new contracts and increase our referral sources 
our continued growth is also dependent upon the authorization by state agencies of new consumers to receive our services 
we believe there are several market opportunities for growth 
the us population of persons aged and older is growing  and the us census bureau estimates that this population will more than double by additionally  we believe the overwhelming majority of individuals in need of care generally prefer to receive care in their homes or community based settings 
finally  we believe the provision of home community services is more cost effective than the provision of similar services in an institutional setting for long term care 
we have historically grown our business primarily through organic growth  complemented with selective acquisitions 
our home community segment acquisitions have been focused on facilitating entry into new states such as new jersey  idaho  nevada  north carolina  south carolina and georgia  whereas our home health 
table of contents segment acquisitions have been focused on complementing our existing home community business in idaho  indiana and south carolina  enabling us to provide a more comprehensive range of services in those locations 
acquisitions in the home health segment  while not significant  reflect our goal of being a comprehensive provider of both home community and home health services in the markets in which we operate 
on july   we entered into an asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement  pursuant to which we acquired the operations and certain assets of advantage health systems  inc  a south carolina corporation advantage 
advantage is a provider of home community  home health and hospice services in south carolina and georgia  which expanded our services across states 
the total consideration payable pursuant to the purchase agreement was million  comprised of million in cash  common stock consideration with a deemed value of million resulting in the issuance of  common shares  a maximum of million in future cash consideration subject to the achievement of certain performance targets set forth in an earn out agreement and the assumption of certain specified liabilities 
on november   we completed our ipo consisting of the sale of  shares of common stock at per share 
after deducting the underwriters discounts and transaction fees and expenses  the net proceeds to us from the sale of shares in the ipo were million 
transaction costs related to the ipo of million were charged directly to additional paid in capital 
in march  the president signed into law the health reform act  which includes several provisions that may affect reimbursement for home health agencies 
the health reform act is broad  sweeping reform  and is subject to change  including through the adoption of related regulations  the way in which its provisions are interpreted and the manner in which it is enforced 
we cannot assure you that the provisions of the health reform act will not adversely impact our business  results of operations or financial position 
we may be unable to mitigate any adverse effects resulting from the health reform act 
on july   the ocr published proposed regulations to implement the health information technology for economic and clinical health act 
failure to comply with health insurance portability and accountability act  or hipaa  could result in fines and penalties that could have a material adverse effect on the company 
recently  the ocr has imposed substantial financial and other penalties on covered entities that improperly disclosed individuals health information 
on july   cms published the proposed home health pps update 
a proposed overall reduction in the home health payment base rate of included a reduction for each day episode and the conversion factor for nrs of 
the decrease  which also will be imposed in  is a result of the cms determination that there has been a general increase in case mix that cms believes is unwarranted 
cms believes that this case mix creep is due to improved coding  coding practice changes  and other behavioral responses to the change in reimbursement that went in to effect in  including greater use of high therapy treatment plans above what cms believes is related to an increase in patient acuity 
cms warned that it will continue to monitor changes in case mix 
if new data identifies additional increases in case mix  cms will immediately impose further reductions 
the health reform act requires a physician certifying a patient for home health services to document that the physician or a non physician practitioner under the direction of the physician has had a face to face encounter with the patient 
in cms s proposed home health rule  cms proposed regulations that would require the face to face encounter to take place within thirty days of the home health start date 
an additional face to face encounter within two weeks of the start date would be required if the original face to face encounter did not primarily relate to the reason for the home health services 
on november   cms released its final home health pps update 
there will be a market basket increase for after application of the mandated reduction and a mandated rate reduction 
the final payment base rate reflects a decrease from the proposed market basket rate in july cms announced that it is postponing its proposed reduction in home health rates for calendar year pending its further monitoring of case mix changes 
home health agencies that do not submit required quality data will be subject to a reduction in the market basket update 

table of contents cms made some revisions to its proposed regulations regarding face to face encounters 
the physician or non physician practitioner must have a face to face encounter with the patient within days of the home health start date 
if there is no face to face encounter within the day period or if the encounter did not relate to the reason for home health  a face to face encounter must occur within days after the home health start date 
cms emphasized that the certification must be dated by the physician not the home health agency and the patient must be under the care of a physician while receiving home health services 
but  the face to face encounter is only required for the initial certification 
the certifying physician may not be the home health agency medical director and the physician or non physician practitioner may not have a financial relationship with the home health agency 
the final home health pps update provided that the face to face encounter requirement would be effective january  in december  in response to requests from home health and hospice provider associations  physician groups and others  cms announced a suspension of the requirement until april  these groups have requested another suspension until july  cms has expressed concern about granting another extension 
although a leading home heath and hospice provider association has expressed it s believe that the odds favor a further extension  we cannot predict whether an extension of the face to face encounter requirement will be granted 
cms also is requiring that for therapy services  a qualified therapist not a therapy assistant must assess the patient  measure progress  and document progress toward therapy goals at least once every days 
for patients requiring or therapy visits  the qualified therapist must perform this evaluation at the th and th therapy visit 
the requirement is relaxed for patients in rural areas  requiring the qualified therapist evaluation any time after the th visit and not later than the th visit  and after the th therapy visit but not later than the th visit 
if more than one therapy is furnished  an evaluation must be made by a qualified therapist for each therapy 
cms also announced that it is going to assess a variety of home health issues  including the current therapy threshold reimbursement 
cms also clarified its rules regarding change of ownership of home health agencies and the month rule 
if there is a change of ownership within months of enrollment in medicare or within months of a prior change of ownership  the home health agency must undergo a new survey 
cms clarified that indirect ownership changes are not subject to the month rule 
there are also several exceptions to the month rule but in order to qualify  the home health agency must have submitted two or more consecutive cost reports excluding low utilization cost reports or no cost report 
exceptions to the month rule include death of an owner and changes in business structure as long as ownership remains the same 

table of contents segments we operate our business through two segments  home community services and home health services 
we have organized our internal management reports to align with these segment designations 
as such  we have identified two reportable segments  home community and home health  applying the criteria in asc  disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the following table presents our locations by segment  setting forth acquisitions  start ups and closures for the period january  to december  home community home health total total at january  acquired start up closed merged total at december  start up closed merged total at december  acquired start up closed merged total at december  as of december   we provided our services through locations across states 
as part of our comprehensive service model  we have integrated and provide both home community and home health services in nine states 
our payor clients are principally federal  state and local governmental agencies 
the federal  state and local programs under which they operate are subject to legislative  budgetary and other risks that can influence reimbursement rates 
our commercial insurance carrier payor clients are typically for profit companies and are continuously seeking opportunities to control costs 
we are seeking to grow our private duty business in both of our segments 
for   and  our payor revenue mix by segment was as follows home community state  local and other governmental programs commercial private duty home health medicare state  local and other governmental programs commercial private duty 
table of contents we also measure the performance of each segment using a number of different metrics 
for our home community segment  we consider billable hours  billable hours per business day  revenues per billable hour and the number of consumers  or census 
for our home health segment  we consider medicare census  non medicare census  medicare admissions and medicare revenues per episode completed 
we derive a significant amount of our net service revenues from our operations in illinois and california  which represented and  and  and and of our total net service revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
a significant amount of our net service revenues are derived from two specific payor clients 
the illinois department on aging  in the home community segment  and medicare  in the home health segment  accounted for and  and  and and of our total net service revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
components of our statements of income net service revenues we generate net service revenues by providing our home community services and home health services directly to consumers 
we receive payment for providing such services from our payor clients  including federal  state and local governmental agencies  commercial insurers and private individuals 
home community segment revenues are typically generated on an hourly basis 
our home community segment revenues were generated principally through reimbursements by state  local and other governmental programs which are partially funded by medicaid or medicaid waiver programs  and to a lesser extent from private duty and insurance programs 
net service revenues for our home community segment are principally provided based on authorized hours  determined by the relevant agency  at an hourly rate  which is either contractual or fixed by legislation  and recognized as net service revenues at the time services are rendered 
home health segment revenues are primarily generated on a per episode or visit basis rather than on a flat fee or an hourly basis 
our home health segment revenues are generated principally through reimbursements by the medicare program  and to a lesser extent from medicaid and medicaid waiver programs  commercial insurers and private duty 
net service revenues from home health payors  other than medicare  are readily determinable and recognized as net service revenues at the time the services are rendered 
medicare reimbursements are based on day episodes of care 
the anticipated net service revenues from an episode are initially recognized as accounts receivable and deferred revenues and subsequently amortized as net service revenues ratably over the day episodic period 
at the end of each episode of care  a final claim billing is submitted to medicare and any changes between the initial anticipated net service revenues and final claim billings are recorded as an adjustment to net service revenues 
for open episodes  we estimate net service revenues based on historical data and adjust for the difference between the initial anticipated net service revenues and the ultimate final claim amount 
cost of service revenues we incur direct care wages  payroll taxes and benefit related costs in connection with our employees providing our home community and home health services 
we also provide workers compensation and general liability coverage for these employees 
employees are also reimbursed for their travel time and related travel costs 
for home health services  we provide medical supplies and occasionally hire contract labor services to supplement existing staffing in order to meet our consumers needs 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with our segments activities and as part of our central administrative functions 

table of contents our general and administrative expenses for home community and home health services consist principally of supervisory personnel  care coordination and office administration costs 
our general and administrative expenses for home health also include additional staffing for clinical and admissions processing 
these expenses consist principally of wages  payroll taxes and benefit related costs  facility rent  operating costs such as utilities  postage  telephone and office expenses  and bad debt expense 
our corporate general and administrative expenses cover the centralized administrative departments of accounting  information systems  human resources  billing and collections and contract administration  as well as national program coordination efforts for marketing and private duty 
these expenses primarily consist of compensation  including stock based compensation  payroll taxes  and related benefits  legal  accounting and other professional fees  rents and related facility costs  and other operating costs such as software application costs  software implementation costs  travel  general insurance and bank account maintenance fees 
depreciation and amortization expenses we amortize our intangible assets with finite lives  consisting of trade names  trademarks and non compete agreements  principally on accelerated methods based upon their estimated useful lives 
depreciable assets at the segment level consist principally of furniture and equipment  and for the home community segment  also include vehicles for our adult day centers 
a substantial portion of our capital expenditures is infrastructure related or for our corporate office 
corporate asset purchases consist primarily of network administration and telephone equipment  operating system software  furniture and equipment 
depreciable and leasehold assets are depreciated or amortized on a straight line method over their useful lives or  if less and if applicable  their lease terms 
interest expense our interest bearing obligations consist principally of our credit facility  dividend notes  notes payable in respect of acquisitions and a derivative financial instrument that did not qualify as an accounting hedge under asc topic  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as such  material changes in the value of the instrument are included in interest expense in any given period 
income tax expense all of our income is from domestic sources 
we incur state and local taxes in states in which we operate 
the differences from the federal statutory rate of are principally due to state taxes and the use of federal employment tax credits 
preferred stock dividends  undeclared subject to payment upon conversion prior to the completion of our ipo  we had  shares of series a preferred stock issued and outstanding  all of which were converted into shares of our common stock on november  shares of our series a preferred stock accumulated dividends each quarter at a rate of  compounded annually 
we accrued these undeclared dividends because the holders had the option to convert their shares of series a preferred stock into common stock at any time with the accumulated dividends payable in cash or a note payable 
our series a preferred stock was converted into  shares of common stock in connection with the completion of our ipo on november  we paid million of the million outstanding accumulated dividends as of november  with the remaining million being converted into junior subordinated promissory notes  which we refer to as the dividend notes 
the dividend notes were amended on march  as described below in liquidity and capital resources

the principal reason for the difference between the statutory rate of and our effective tax rates is the use of federal work opportunity tax credits 
the effective tax rate increased by which was primarily due to a increase related to our ipo  in connection with which the former chairman of addus healthcare entered into a separation agreement which terminated his employment with addus healthcare 
as a result of the termination and the time permitted to exercise any vested options expiring following such termination   stock options were not exercised and deemed forfeited and million in deferred tax assets were written off 
in addition  a decrease in our federal work opportunity tax credit in resulted in a increase in our effective tax rate 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources overview our primary sources of liquidity are cash from operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
at december  and  we had cash balances of million and million  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities represent the inflow of cash from our payor clients and the outflow of cash for payroll and payroll taxes  operating expenses  interest and taxes 
due to its revenue deficiencies and financing issues  the state of illinois has been reimbursing us on a delayed basis with respect to our various agreements including our largest payor  the illinois department on aging 
as a result  the open net receivable balance from the state of illinois increased by million for the year ended december   from million as of december  to million as of december  while the net receivable balance has increased  this is a result of increased business activities with the state of illinois 
we have experienced an improvement in the payment amounts received from the state of illinois in as compared to these payment delays have adversely impacted  and may further adversely impact  our liquidity  and may result in the need to increase borrowings under our credit facility 
delayed reimbursements from our other state of illinois payors and deterioration in the aging in the private duty business have also contributed to the increase in our receivables balances 
on march   we entered into the first amendment the first amendment to our credit facility 
the first amendment i increased the maximum aggregate amount of revolving loans available to us by million to million  ii modified our maximum senior debt leverage ratio from to to to for the twelve month period ending march  and each twelve month period ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter and iii increased the advance multiple used to determine the amount of the borrowing base from to 
on march   we also amended our subordinated dividend notes that we issued on november  in the aggregate original principal amount of million 
a balance of million was outstanding on the dividend notes as of december  pursuant to the amendments  the dividend notes were amended to i extend the maturity date of the notes from september  to december   ii modify the amortization schedule of the notes to reduce the annual principal payment amounts from million to million in  from million to million in  and provide for total payments in of million and iii permit  based on our leverage ratio  the prepayment of all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes  together with interest on the principal amount 
on july   we entered into a second amendment the second amendment to our credit facility

table of contents while our growth plan is not dependent on the completion of acquisitions  if we do not have sufficient cash resources or availability under our credit facility  or we are otherwise prohibited from making acquisitions  our growth could be limited unless we obtain additional equity or debt financing or unless we obtain the necessary consents from our lenders 
we believe the available borrowings under our credit facility which  when taken together with cash from operations  will be sufficient to cover our working capital needs for at least the next months

as of december  we had million outstanding on the credit facility 
outstanding accounts receivable outstanding accounts receivable  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts  increased by million for the year ended december  as compared to december  the increase was primarily attributable to higher revenues and delays in reimbursements from certain payors 
we establish our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
our provision for doubtful accounts is estimated and recorded primarily by aging receivables utilizing eight aging categories and applying our historical collection rates to each aging category  taking into consideration factors that might impact the use of historical collection rates or payor groups  with certain large payors analyzed separately from other payor groups 
in our evaluation of these estimates  we also consider delays in payment trends in individual states due to budget or funding issues  billing conversions related to acquisitions or internal systems  resubmission of bills with required documentation and disputes with specific payors 
we have experienced increases in the aging of our accounts receivable resulting from billing delays during the conversion process  either procedural or internal  related to both acquired agencies and transferring our existing home community locations from a legacy system to the centralized mckesson operating system 
reasons for the delays include obtaining approvals from federal and state governmental agencies of provider numbers we acquired with our acquisitions  mckesson payor and billing set up processes and required staff training 
during and we have also experienced a significant increase in our private duty business  which inherently carries a higher collection risk  especially in our home community segment 
unlike our state  local and other governmental payors  these customers are responsible for their own payment a portion of which may be funded through qualified veteran benefits 
contributing to higher receivable balances are veteran benefits that may take several months to be awarded by the veterans health administration 

table of contents our collection procedures include review of account agings and direct contact with our payors 
we have historically not used collection agencies 
an uncollectible amount  not governed by amount or aging  is written off to the allowance account only after reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted

we were in compliance with all of our credit facility covenants at december  dividend notes on november   in conjunction with our ipo  all outstanding shares of holdings series a preferred stock were converted into an aggregate million shares of common stock at a ratio of total accrued and unpaid dividends on the series a preferred stock were million as of november   at which time a dividend payment of million was made and the remaining million in unpaid preferred dividends were converted into dividend notes 
the dividend notes are subordinated and junior to all obligations under our credit facility 
on november   we made a mandatory payment of million on the dividend notes 
interest on the outstanding dividend notes accrues at a rate of per annum  compounded annually 
the outstanding principal amount of the dividend notes was originally payable in eight equal consecutive quarterly installments 
table of contents which commenced on december  and each march  june  september and december of each year thereafter until paid in full 
interest on the unpaid principal balance of the dividend notes is due and payable quarterly in arrears together with each payment of principal 
on march   we amended our subordinated dividend notes 
pursuant to the amendments  the dividend notes were amended to i extend the maturity date of the dividend notes from september  to december   ii modify the amortization schedule of the dividend notes to reduce the annual principal payment amounts from million to million in  from million to million in  and amended total payments in to million  and iii permit  based on our leverage ratio  the prepayment of all or a portion of the principal amount of the dividend notes  together with interest on the principal amount 
a balance of million was outstanding on the dividend notes as of december  off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet guarantees or arrangements with unconsolidated entities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expense and related disclosures 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other sources and factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider the items discussed below to be critical because of their impact on operations and their application requires our judgment and estimates 
revenue recognition approximately of our home community segment revenues are derived from medicaid and medicaid waiver programs under agreements with various state and local authorities 
these agreements provide for a service term ranging from one year to an indefinite term 
services are provided based on authorized hours  determined by the relevant state or local agency  at an hourly rate specified in the agreement or fixed by legislation 
services to other payors  such as private or commercial clients  are provided at negotiated hourly rates and recognized in net service revenues as services are provided 
we provide for appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts at the time the services are rendered 
approximately of our home health segment revenues are derived from medicare 
home health services are reimbursed by medicare based on episodes of care 
under pps  an episode of care is defined as a length of care up to days per patient with multiple continuous episodes allowed 
billings per episode under pps vary based on the severity of the patient s condition and are subject to adjustment  both higher and lower  for changes in the patient s medical condition and certain other reasons 
at the inception of each episode of care  we submit a request for anticipated payment  or rap  to medicare for to of the estimated pps reimbursement 
we estimate the net pps revenues to be earned during an episode of care based on the initial rap billing  historical trends and other known factors 
the net pps revenues are initially recognized as deferred revenues and subsequently amortized as net service revenues ratably over the day episodic period 
at the end of each episode of care  a final claim billing is submitted to medicare and any changes between the initial rap and final claim billings are recorded as an adjustment to net service revenues 
for open episodes  we estimate net revenues based on historical data  and adjust net service revenues for the difference  if any  between the initial rap and ultimate final claim amount 
we did not record any significant adjustments of prior period net pps estimates 

table of contents the other approximately of revenues in our home health segment are from state and local governmental agencies  commercial insurers and private individuals 
services are primarily provided to these payors on a per visit basis based on negotiated rates 
as such  net service revenues are readily determinable and recognized at the time the services are rendered 
we provide for appropriate allowances for uncollectible amounts at the time the services are rendered 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts we are paid for our services primarily by state and local agencies under medicaid or medicaid waiver programs  medicare  commercial insurance companies and private individuals 
while our accounts receivable are uncollateralized  our credit risk is somewhat limited due to the significance of medicare and state agency payors to our results of operations 
laws and regulations governing the medicaid and medicare programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
amounts collected may be different than amounts billed due to client eligibility issues  insufficient or incomplete documentation  services at levels other than authorized and other reasons unrelated to credit risk 
legislation enacted in illinois entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time 
as the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain  the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the income statement caption  interest expense  net 
we recorded million of prompt payment interest income in the fourth quarter of we establish our allowance for doubtful accounts to the extent it is probable that a portion or all of a particular account will not be collected 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated and recorded primarily by aging receivables utilizing eight aging categories and applying our historical collection rates to each aging category  taking into consideration factors that might impact the use of historical collection rates or payor groups  with certain large payors analyzed separately from other payor groups 
in our evaluation of these estimates  we also consider delays in payment trends in individual states due to budget or funding issues  billing conversions related to acquisitions or internal systems  resubmission of bills with required documentation and disputes with specific payors 
historically  we have not experienced any write off of accounts as a result of a state operating with budget deficits 
while we regularly monitor state budget and funding developments for the states in which we operate  we consider losses due to state credit risk on outstanding balances as remote 
we believe that our recorded allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover potential losses  however  actual collections in subsequent periods may require changes to our estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets are stated at fair value at the time of acquisition and the carrying value of goodwill is the residual of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
our intangible assets with finite lives  consisting of trade names  trademarks and non compete agreements  are amortized principally on accelerated methods based upon their estimated useful lives 
in accordance with asc topic  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are required to be tested for impairment at least annually using a two step method 
we test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis  as of october  or whenever circumstances change  such as a significant change in business climate or regulatory changes that would indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
the evaluation of goodwill impairment involves comparing the current fair value of each reporting unit to the recorded value  including goodwill 
we use a combination of a discounted cash flow  or dcf  model and the market multiple analysis method to determine the current fair value of each reporting unit 
the dcf model was prepared using revenue and expense projections based on our current operating plan 
as such  a number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the dcf model to forecast revenue growth  price changes  gross profits  operating expenses and operating cash flows 
as part of the second step of this evaluation  if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss would be recognized 

table of contents we completed our annual impairment test of goodwill as of october  and determined that no goodwill impairment existed as of october  although we believe that the financial projections used in the assessment are reasonable and appropriate for our two reporting units  there is uncertainty inherent in those projections 
as of december   we determined that no events or circumstances from october  through december  indicated that a further assessment was necessary 
however  the current federal and state economic and reimbursement environments and state budgetary pressures to decrease or eliminate services provided by us could have a negative effect on our future earnings and cash flows from operations  as well as our total stockholders equity exceeding our market capitalization as of december   are all factors indicating the possibility of future impairment to our goodwill 
our total stockholders equity was million as of december  and our market capitalization was million based on million shares of common stock outstanding as of december  while the market capitalization of approximately million is below our stockholders equity and was considered in our evaluation of fair value  the market capitalization metric is only one indicator of fair value 
in our opinion  the market capitalization approach  by itself  is not a reliable indicator of our value 
we will continue to monitor market conditions and determine if any additional interim review of goodwill is warranted 
further deterioration in the market or actual results as compared with our projections may ultimately result in a future impairment 
in the event that we determine goodwill is impaired in the future  we would need to recognize a non cash impairment charge  which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated balance sheet and results of operations 
long lived assets we review our long lived assets and finite lived intangibles except goodwill and other intangible assets  as described above for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
to determine if impairment exists  we compare the estimated future undiscounted cash flows from the related long lived assets to the net carrying amount of such assets 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset  generally determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows 
workers compensation program our workers compensation insurance program has a  deductible component 
we recognize our obligations associated with this program in the period the claim is incurred 
the cost of both the claims reported and claims incurred but not reported  up to the deductible  have been accrued based on historical claims experience  industry statistics and an actuarial analysis performed by an independent third party 
we monitor our claims quarterly and adjust our reserves accordingly 
these costs are recorded primarily in the cost of services caption in the consolidated statement of income 
under the agreement pursuant to which we acquired addus healthcare  claims under our workers compensation insurance program that relate to december  or earlier are the responsibility of the selling shareholders in the acquisition  subject to certain limitations 
interest expense  net our net interest expense consists of interest costs on our credit facility and other debt instruments and is recorded net of any interest income recorded by us 
legislation enacted in illinois entitles designated service program providers to receive a prompt payment interest penalty based on qualifying services approved for payment that remain unpaid after a designated period of time 
as the amount and timing of the receipt of these payments are not certain  the interest income is recognized when received and reported in the income statement caption  interest expense  net 
we recorded million of prompt payment interest income in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of asc topic  accounting for income taxes 
the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
deferred taxes  resulting from differences between the financial and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  are also adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted 
asc also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
new accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  health care entities topic presentation of insurance claims and related insurance recoveries which clarifies for medical malpractice claims or similar contingent liabilities  a health care entity should not net insurance recoveries against a related claim liability 
the amendments in the this asu are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  we do not expect the adoption of this asu to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and commitments we have outstanding letters of credit of million at december  these standby letters of credit benefit our third party insurer for our high deductible workers compensation insurance program 
the amount of letters of credit is negotiated annually in conjunction with the insurance renewals 
we anticipate our commitment will increase as we continue to grow our business and more years are the responsibility of the successor

our credit facility was entered into on november  and matures on november  on march   we entered into the first amendment to our credit facility 
the first amendment i increased the maximum aggregate amount of revolving loans available to us by million to million  ii modified our maximum senior debt leverage ratio from to to to for the twelve month period ending march  and each twelve month period ending on the last day of each fiscal quarter thereafter and iii increased the advance multiple used to determine the amount of the borrowing base from to to to on july   we entered into the second amendment to our credit facility 
the second amendment provided for a million term loan component of the credit 
table of contents facility  the proceeds of which were used to finance a portion of the purchase price payable in connection with our acquisition of certain assets of advantage effective july  the term loan will be repaid in equal monthly installments which commenced in february interest on the new term loan under the credit facility is payable either at a floating rate equal to the day libor  plus an applicable margin of or the libor rate for term periods of one  two  three or six months plus a margin of 
interest will be paid monthly or at the end of the relevant interest period 
the term loan has a maturity date of january  on march   we amended our subordinated dividend notes that we issued on november  in the aggregate original principal amount of million 
a balance of million was outstanding on the dividend notes as of december  pursuant to the amendments  the dividend notes were amended to i extend the maturity date of the notes from september  to december   ii modify the amortization schedule of the notes to reduce the annual principal payment amounts from million to million in year and from million to million in  and provides for total payments in of million and iii permit  based on our leverage ratio  the prepayment of all or a portion of the principal amount of the notes  together with interest on the principal amount 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures  we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases 
our inability or failure to do so could harm our business  financial condition and results of operation
