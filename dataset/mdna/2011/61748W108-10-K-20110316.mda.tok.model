item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected historical financial and operating data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to  those set forth under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a fully integrated hospitality company that operates  owns  acquires  develops and redevelops boutique hotels primarily in gateway cities and select resort markets in the united states and europe 
over our year history  we have gained experience operating in a variety of market conditions 
the historical financial data presented herein is the historical financial data for our owned hotels as of december   consisting of morgans  royalton and hudson in new york  delano south beach in miami beach  mondrian los angeles in los angeles  and clift in san francisco  our joint venture hotels as of december   consisting of our london hotels sanderson and st martins lane  hard rock hotel casino in las vegas  mondrian south beach and shore club in miami beach  ames in boston  and the san juan water and beach club in isla verde  puerto rico  our investments in hotels under construction  such as mondrian soho prior to its opening in february  and our investment in other proposed properties  our investment in certain joint venture food and beverage operations at our owned hotels and joint venture hotels  discussed further below  our management company subsidiary  morgans hotel group management llc  or mhg management company  and certain non us management company affiliates  and the rights and obligations contributed to morgans group  our operating company  in the formation and structuring transactions described in note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
as of december   we consolidate the results of operations  including food and beverage operations  for all of our owned hotels 
certain food and beverage operations at three of our owned hotels  are operated under joint ventures with restaurateur jeffrey chodorow 
we consolidate the food and beverage joint ventures as we believe that we are the primary beneficiary of these entities 
our partner s share of the results of operations of these food and beverage joint ventures are recorded as noncontrolling interests in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we own partial interests in the joint venture hotels and certain food and beverage operations at three of the joint venture hotels  sanderson  st martins lane and mondrian south beach 
we account for these investments using the equity method as we believe we do not exercise control over significant asset decisions such as buying  selling or financing nor are we the primary beneficiary of the entities 
under the equity method  we increase our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for our proportionate share of net income and contributions and decrease our investment balance for our proportionate share of net losses and distributions 

table of contents as of december   we operated the following joint venture hotels under management agreements which expire as follows sanderson june with one year extension at our option  st martins lane june with one year extension at our option  shore club july  hard rock february subsequently terminated effective march  mondrian south beach august  ames november  and san juan water and beach club october subject to certain conditions 
in addition to the joint venture hotels  we also manage hotel las palapas in playa del carmen  mexico under a management agreement which expires in december  with one five year extension  which is automatic so long as we are not in default under the management agreement 
we do not have an ownership interest in hotel las palapas 
in february  we opened mondrian soho which we manage under a year management agreement with two year extension options 
we have signed management agreements to manage various other hotels that are in development  including a mondrian palm springs project  a delano project in cabo san lucas  mexico  a delano project on the aegean sea in turkey  a hotel project in the highline area in new york city and a mondrian project in doha  qatar  but we are unsure of the future of the development of these hotels as financing has not yet been obtained 
these management agreements may be subject to early termination in specified circumstances 
several of our hotels are also subject to substantial mortgage and mezzanine debt  and in some instances our management fee is subordinated to the debt  and our management agreements may be terminated by the lenders on foreclosure or certain other related events 
in march  the lender for the shore club mortgage initiated foreclosure proceedings against the property in us federal district court 
in october  the federal court dismissed the case for lack of jurisdiction 
in light of this dismissal  it is possible that the lender may initiate foreclosure proceedings in state court 
we have continued to operate the hotel pursuant to the management agreement during these proceedings 
however  there can be no assurances that we will continue to operate the hotel in the event of foreclosure 
in october  the mortgage loan secured by ames matured  and the joint venture did not satisfy the conditions necessary to exercise the first of two remaining one year extension options available under the loan  which included funding a debt service reserve account  among other things 
as a result  the mortgage lender for ames served the joint venture with a notice of default and acceleration of debt 
in february  the joint venture reached an agreement with the lender whereby the lender waived the default  reinstated the loan and extended the loan maturity date until october  in connection with the amendment  the joint venture was required to deposit million into a debt service account 

table of contents factors affecting our results of operations revenues 
changes in our revenues are most easily explained by three performance indicators that are commonly used in the hospitality industry occupancy  average daily room rate adr  and revenue per available rooms revpar  which is the product of adr and average daily occupancy  but does not include food and beverage revenue  other hotel operating revenue such as telephone  parking and other guest services  or management fee revenue 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from the operation of our hotels 
specifically  our revenue consists of rooms revenue 
occupancy and adr are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
food and beverage revenue 
most of our food and beverage revenue is earned by our restaurant joint ventures and is driven by occupancy of our hotels and the popularity of our bars and restaurants with our local customers 
other hotel revenue 
other hotel revenue  which consists of ancillary revenue such as telephone  parking  spa  entertainment and other guest services  is principally driven by hotel occupancy 
management fee related parties revenue and other income 
we earn fees under our management agreements 
these fees may include management fees as well as reimbursement for allocated chain services 
fluctuations in revenues  which tend to correlate with changes in gross domestic product  are driven largely by general economic and local market conditions but can also be impacted by major events  such as terrorist attacks or natural disasters  which in turn affect levels of business and leisure travel 
the seasonal nature of the hospitality business can also impact revenues 
for example  our miami hotels are generally strongest in the first quarter  whereas our new york hotels are generally strongest in the fourth quarter 
however  given the global economic downturn  the impact of seasonality in and was not as significant as in prior periods and may remain less pronounced throughout depending on the timing and strength of the economic recovery 
in addition to economic conditions  supply is another important factor that can affect revenues 
room rates and occupancy tend to fall when supply increases  unless the supply growth is offset by an equal or greater increase in demand 
one reason why we focus on boutique hotels in key gateway cities is because these markets have significant barriers to entry for new competitive supply  including scarcity of available land for new development and extensive regulatory requirements resulting in a longer development lead time and additional expense for new competitors 
finally  competition within the hospitality industry can affect revenues 
competitive factors in the hospitality industry include name recognition  quality of service  convenience of location  quality of the property  pricing  and range and quality of food services and amenities offered 
in addition  all of our hotels  restaurants and bars are located in areas where there are numerous competitors  many of whom have substantially greater resources than us 
new or existing competitors could offer significantly lower rates or more convenient locations  services or amenities or significantly expand  improve or introduce new service offerings in markets in which our hotels compete  thereby posing a greater competitive threat than at present 
if we are unable to compete effectively  we would lose market share  which could adversely affect our revenues 
operating costs and expenses 
our operating costs and expenses consist of the costs to provide hotel services  costs to operate our management company  and costs associated with the ownership of our assets  including rooms expense 
rooms expense includes the payroll and benefits for the front office  housekeeping  concierge and reservations departments and related expenses  such as laundry  rooms supplies  travel agent commissions and reservation expense 
like rooms revenue  occupancy is a major driver of rooms expense  which has a significant correlation with rooms revenue 

table of contents food and beverage expense 
similar to food and beverage revenue  occupancy of our hotels and the popularity of our restaurants and bars are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which has a significant correlation with food and beverage revenue 
other departmental expense 
occupancy is the major driver of other departmental expense  which includes telephone and other expenses related to the generation of other hotel revenue 
hotel selling  general and administrative expense 
hotel selling  general and administrative expense consist of administrative and general expenses  such as payroll and related costs  travel expenses and office rent  advertising and promotion expenses  comprising the payroll of the hotel sales teams  the global sales team and advertising  marketing and promotion expenses for our hotel properties  utility expense and repairs and maintenance expenses  comprising the ongoing costs to repair and maintain our hotel properties 
property taxes  insurance and other 
property taxes  insurance and other consist primarily of insurance costs and property taxes 
corporate expenses  including stock compensation 
corporate expenses consist of the cost of our corporate office  net of any cost recoveries  which consists primarily of payroll and related costs  stock based compensation expenses  office rent and legal and professional fees and costs associated with being a public company 
depreciation and amortization expense 
hotel properties are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
restructuring  development and disposal costs include costs incurred related to our restructuring initiatives  charges associated with disposals of assets as part of major renovation projects and the write off of abandoned development projects resulting primarily from events generally outside management s control such as the current tightness of the credit markets 
these items do not relate to the ongoing operating performance of our assets 
impairment loss on receivables from unconsolidated joint ventures includes impairment costs incurred related to receivables deemed uncollectible 
other items interest expense  net 
interest expense  net includes interest on our debt and amortization of financing costs and is presented net of interest income and interest capitalized 
interest expense of property held for non sale disposition 
interest expense of property held for non sale disposition includes interest on our non recourse promissory notes on the property across from the delano south beach 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures 
equity in income loss of unconsolidated joint ventures constitutes our share of the net profits and losses of our joint venture hotels and our investments in hotels under development 
further  we and our joint venture partners review our joint venture hotels for other than temporary declines in market value 
in this analysis of fair value  we use discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of our investment taking into account expected cash flow from operations  holding period and net proceeds from the dispositions of the property 
any decline that is not expected to be recovered is considered other than temporary and an impairment charge is recorded as a reduction in the carrying value of the investment 

table of contents impairment loss on property held for non sale disposition 
when certain triggering events occur  we periodically review each asset for possible impairment 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated discounted future cash flows of the asset  taking into account the applicable assets expected cash flow from operations  holding period and net proceeds from the disposition of the asset 
for the year ended december   management concluded that our investment in the property across the street from delano south beach was impaired 
other non operating income expenses include costs associated with financings  litigation and settlement costs and other items that relate to the financing and investing activities associated with our assets and not to the ongoing operating performance of our assets  both consolidated and unconsolidated  as well as the change in fair market value of our warrants issued in connection with the yucaipa transaction 
income tax expense benefit 
all of our foreign subsidiaries are subject to local jurisdiction corporate income taxes 
income tax expense is reported at the applicable rate for the periods presented 
we are subject to federal and state income taxes 
income taxes for the years ended december   and were computed using our calculated effective tax rate 
we also recorded net deferred taxes related to cumulative differences in the basis recorded for certain assets and liabilities 
we established a reserve on the deferred tax assets based on the ability to utilize net operating losses going forward 
noncontrolling interest 
noncontrolling interest constitutes our third party food and beverage joint venture partner s interest in the profits and losses of the restaurant ventures at certain of our hotels as well as the percentage of membership units in morgans group  our operating company  owned by residual hotel interest llc  our former parent  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
in march  the mortgage lender foreclosed on mondrian scottsdale and we were terminated as the property s manager 
as such  we have recorded the income or loss earned from mondrian scottsdale in the income loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  on the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
preferred stock dividends and accretion 
dividends attributable to our outstanding preferred stock and the accretion of the fair value discount on the issuance of the preferred stock are reflected as adjustments to our net loss to arrive at net loss attributable to common stockholders  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
most categories of variable operating expenses  such as operating supplies  and certain labor  such as housekeeping  fluctuate with changes in occupancy 
increases in revpar attributable to increases in occupancy are accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs and expenses 
increases in revpar attributable to improvements in adr typically only result in increases in limited categories of operating costs and expenses  primarily credit card and travel agent commissions 
thus  improvements in adr have a more significant impact on improving our operating margins than occupancy 
notwithstanding our efforts to reduce variable costs  there are limits to how much we can accomplish because we have significant costs that are relatively fixed costs  such as depreciation and amortization  labor costs and employee benefits  insurance  real estate taxes  interest and other expenses associated with owning hotels that do not necessarily decrease when circumstances such as market factors cause a reduction in our hotel revenues 
recent trends and developments recent trends 
starting in the fourth quarter of and continuing throughout  the weakened us and global economies resulted in considerable negative pressure on both consumer and business spending 
as a result  lodging demand and revenues  which are primarily driven by growth in gdp  business investment and employment growth weakened substantially during this period as compared to the lodging demand and revenues we experienced prior to the fourth quarter of while the outlook for the us and global economies have improved  unemployment remains high and spending by businesses and consumers remains cautious 
in addition  there are still several trends which make our lodging performance difficult to forecast  including shorter booking lead times at our hotels 

table of contents we experienced positive trends in as we saw improvement in demand in key gateway markets  particularly in new york and london 
these markets experienced increasing occupancy in all quarters  accompanied by increases in average daily rate in the second  third and fourth quarters of guests are still spending conservatively on ancillary services in light of the uncertain economic recovery 
in addition  unusually severe winter storms in december in europe and the united states significantly disrupted air travel  which had a negative impact on our new york  miami and london properties 
overall  our operating results were still below pre recessionary levels 
as demand continues to strengthen  we are focusing on revenue enhancement by actively managing rates and availability 
with increased demand  the ability to increase pricing will be a critical component in driving profitability 
through these uncertain times  our strategy and focus continues to be to preserve profit margins by maximizing revenue  increasing our market share and managing costs 
our strategy includes re energizing our food and beverage offerings by taking action to improve key facilities with a focus on driving higher beverage to food ratios and re igniting the buzz around our nightlife and lobby scenes 
in  we renovated and re concepted several of our existing restaurants 
the new restaurants included hudson hall at the hudson  which opened in may  blue door fish at delano south beach  which opened in november and forty four at the royalton  which opened in october we are also actively managing costs at each of our properties and our corporate office 
through our multi phased contingency plan  we reduced hotel operating expenses and corporate expenses during and we continue to focus on containing operating costs without affecting the guest experience 
we believe that these cost reduction plans have resulted and will continue to result in significant savings  although market conditions may require increases in certain areas 
the pace of new lodging supply has increased over the past two years as many projects initiated before the economic downturn came to fruition 
for example  we witnessed new competitive luxury and boutique properties opening in  and in some of our markets  particularly in los angeles  miami beach  las vegas and new york  which have impacted our performance in these markets and may continue to do so 
however  we believe the timing of new development projects may be affected by the severe recession  ongoing uncertain economic conditions and reduced availability of financing compared to pre recession periods 
these factors may dampen the pace of new supply development  including our own  in the next few years 
in  we believe that if various economic forecasts projecting continued modest expansion are accurate  this may lead to a gradual and modest increase in lodging demand for both leisure and business travel  although we expect there to be continued pressure on rates  as leisure and business travelers alike continue to focus on cost containment 
as such  there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will occur  or be sustained  or that any losses will not increase for these or any other reasons 
we believe that the global credit market conditions will also gradually improve during  although we believe there will continue to be less credit available and on less favorable terms than were obtainable in prior years 
given the current state of the credit markets  some of our development projects may not be able to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner or at all 
if adequate project financing is not obtained  the joint ventures or developers  as applicable  may seek additional equity investors to raise capital  limit the scope of the project  defer the project or cancel the project altogether 
recent developments 
in addition to the recent trends described above  we expect that a number of recent events will cause our future results of operations to differ from our historical performance

total hotel revenues increased to million in compared to million in the components of revpar from our comparable owned hotels for and are summarized as follows change change occupancy adr revpar 
table of contents revpar from our owned hotels increased to in compared to in rooms revenue increased to million in compared to million in  which is directly attributable to the increase in occupancy and adr shown above 
strong corporate travel  particularly in new york  was a key factor in the increase 
food and beverage revenue decreased to million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily attributable to a decline in food and beverage revenue at hudson during the year as compared to  as the hotel s primary restaurant was closed and the new restaurant  hudson hall  opened in late may food and beverage revenue was also down at royalton  as the restaurant was closed for part of the third quarter of for renovation and re concepting 
the new royalton restaurant  forty four  opened in early october other hotel revenue decreased to million in compared to million in the slight decrease is primarily due to decreased revenues related to ancillary services  such as our spas at delano and mondrian los angeles  as guests are still spending conservatively in light of the uncertain economic recovery 
offsetting this decrease  newly installed wireless infrastructures at certain of our owned hotels have contributed to an increase in internet revenues 
management fee related parties and other income increased by to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in management fees earned at hard rock due to the property expansion project that was underway during and resulted in new rooms that opened in july and an additional new rooms that opened in december additionally  an increase also occurred due to management fees earned at ames  which opened in november  the san juan water and beach club  which we began managing in october  and hotel las palapas  which we began managing in december operating costs and expenses rooms expense increased to million in compared to million in this increase is a direct result of the increase in rooms revenue attributed to increased occupancy 
we implemented cost cutting initiatives at our hotels in and early which we intend to maintain as occupancy rebounds 
food and beverage expense increased to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily due to a increase in expenses at royalton as a result of increased expenses related to the reconcepting of the restaurant  including promotion costs  and an increase in state unemployment taxes as a result of the staff level restructuring implemented in offsetting this increase is a decrease in food and beverage expenses at hudson as a result of the primary restaurant being closed from january to may for re concepting and renovation  as discussed above  and a slight decrease at clift  where we re concepted the restaurant venue beginning in early and began operating it directly  rather than through our restaurant joint venture  resulting in cost savings 
other departmental expense decreased to million in compared to million in this decrease is consistent with cost saving initiatives implemented in and hotel selling  general and administrative expense increased to million in compared to million in this increase was primarily due to increased sales and marketing expenses incurred in property taxes  insurance and other expense decreased to million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to property tax refunds at three of our new york hotels received during for which there were no comparable refunds received in the same period in 
table of contents corporate expenses  including stock compensation increased by to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily due to restored bonus accruals to more normalized levels during the year as compared to depreciation and amortization increased to million in as compared to million in this increase is primarily the result of depreciation on capital improvements required to maintain our existing hotels incurred during and increased depreciation expense related to the recent lower level expansion at hudson  good units  and the restaurant re concepting  hudson hall  both of which occurred during the first half of restructuring  development and disposal costs decreased to million in as compared to million in this decrease in expense is primarily related to the write off of certain development expenses related to our investment in mondrian south beach in for which there was no comparable expense in impairment loss on property held for non sale disposition was in as compared to million in an impairment charge was taken on the property across from delano south beach to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value during for which there was no comparable expense in impairment loss on receivables from unconsolidated joint venture was million in for which there was no comparable loss in the same period in we impaired these outstanding receivables due from hard rock  as management concluded that collection of these receivables was uncertain 
we released this receivable on march  as part of the general release signed in connection with the hard rock settlement agreement 
interest expense  net decreased to million in compared to million in this decrease is primarily due to decreased interest expense recognized as a result of the expiration in july of the interest rate swaps related to the loans secured by the hudson and mondrian los angeles hotels which had fixed our interest expense on those loans at a much higher rate than the current libor rates 
interest expense of property held for non sale disposition increased to million in compared to million in this increase is primarily due to interest payments that were capitalized to the development project during part of equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased to a loss of million in compared to a loss of million in this change was primarily a result of the million impairment charge we recognized on our investment in echelon las vegas in for which there was no comparable impairment charge in during  we recognized a million impairment charge on our investment in mondrian soho 
slightly offsetting the impairment charges recognized in were increases in equity in income recognized from the london joint venture which owns sanderson and st martins lane

we have both short term and long term liquidity requirements as described in more detail below 
liquidity requirements short term liquidity requirements 
we generally consider our short term liquidity requirements to consist of those items that are expected to be incurred by us or our consolidated subsidiaries within the next months and believe those requirements currently consist primarily of funds necessary to pay operating expenses and other expenditures directly associated with our properties  including the funding of our reserve accounts  capital commitments associated with certain of our development projects  and payment of scheduled debt maturities  unless otherwise extended or refinanced 
we are obligated to maintain reserve funds for capital expenditures at our owned hotels as determined pursuant to our debt or lease agreements related to such hotels  with the exception of delano south beach  royalton and morgans 
our joint venture hotels and hotel las palapas  which we manage  generally are subject to similar obligations under debt agreements related to such hotels  or under our management agreements 
these capital expenditures relate primarily to the periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment 
such agreements typically require us to reserve funds at amounts equal to of the hotel s revenues and require the funds to be set aside in restricted cash 
in addition  our restaurant joint ventures require the ventures to set aside restricted cash of between to of gross revenues of the restaurant 
our owned hotels that were not subject to these reserve funding obligations delano south beach  royalton  and morgans underwent significant room and common area renovations during  and  and as such  are not expected to require a substantial amount of capital spending during in addition to reserve funds for capital expenditures  our debt and lease agreements also require us to deposit cash into escrow accounts for taxes  insurance and debt service payments 
as of december   total restricted cash was million 
this amount includes approximately million in curtailment reserve accounts related to the hudson and mondrian los angeles loans 
these loans previously required that all excess cash be deposited into these accounts until such time as the debt service coverage ratio improved above the required ratio of to for two consecutive quarters 
in october  when the hudson and mondrian los angeles loans were extended  approximately million from these curtailment reserve accounts were used to reduce the amount of mortgage debt outstanding under the loans 
under the amended mortgages  all excess cash will continue to be deposited into curtailment reserve accounts regardless of the debt service coverage ratio 
further  as of december   we had aggregate capital commitments or plans to fund joint venture and owned development projects of approximately million  which we funded in the first quarter of in connection with the mondrian soho project 

table of contents as of december   we had outstanding million interest only  non recourse promissory notes relating to the property across the street from delano south beach which would have matured on january  prior to the maturity date  in january  our indirect subsidiary transferred its interests in the property to su gale properties  llc 
as a result of this transaction  we are released from the million of non recourse promissory notes 
in october  both our amended revolving credit facility  with an outstanding balance of million as of december   and the amended mortgages on hudson and mondrian los angeles  with an outstanding aggregate balance of million as of december   will mature 
in addition  the mezzanine debt of million at hudson may not be extended if the underlying mortgage debt is not extended 
we are pursuing a number of options to finance the maturities  including debt financing opportunities  the proceeds of hotel sales that we engage in as part of our strategy to shift towards a more asset light business model  and other sources 
we believe that the combination of rising hotel cash flows and improving capital markets should provide access to sufficient capital to retire or refinance these debts and provide capital for growth 
historically  we have satisfied our liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including borrowings under our revolving credit facility  our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  equity and debt offerings  and long term mortgages on our properties 
other sources may include cash generated through asset dispositions and joint venture transactions 
additionally  we may secure other financing opportunities 
given the uncertain economic environment and continuing difficult conditions in the credit markets  however  we may not be able to obtain such financings  or succeed in selling any assets  on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may require additional borrowings to satisfy these liquidity requirements 
see also other liquidity matters below for additional liquidity that may be required in the short term  depending on market and other circumstances  including our ability to refinance or extend existing debt 
long term liquidity requirements 
we generally consider our long term liquidity requirements to consist of those items that are expected to be incurred by us or our consolidated subsidiaries beyond the next months and believe these requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay scheduled debt maturities  renovations and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our properties and the costs associated with acquisitions and development of properties under contract and new acquisitions and development projects that we may pursue 
our series a preferred securities have an dividend rate for the first five years  a dividend rate for years six and seven  and a dividend rate thereafter 
we have the option to accrue any and all dividend payments  and as of december   have not declared any dividends 
we have the option to redeem any or all of the series a preferred securities at any time 
while we do not anticipate redeeming any or all of the series a preferred securities in the near term  we may want to redeem them prior to the escalation in dividend rate to in other long term liquidity requirements include our obligations under our hudson mezzanine loan  obligations under our convertible notes  our obligations under our trust preferred securities  and our obligations under the clift lease  each as described under debt 
historically  we have satisfied our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  equity and debt offerings  and long term mortgages on our properties 
other sources may include cash generated through asset dispositions and joint venture transactions 
additionally  we may secure other financing opportunities 
given the uncertain economic environment and continuing challenging conditions in the credit markets  however  we may not be able to obtain such financings on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may require additional borrowings to satisfy our long term liquidity requirements 
additionally  we anticipate we will need to renovate hudson  clift  sanderson and st martins lane in the next few years  which will require a substantial amount of capital and will most likely be funded by owner equity contributions  debt financing  possible asset sales  future operating cash flows or a combination of these sources 

table of contents although the credit and equity markets remain challenging  we believe that these sources of capital will become available to us in the future to fund our long term liquidity requirements 
however  our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our degree of leverage  borrowing restrictions imposed by existing lenders and general market conditions 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time 
other liquidity matters in addition to our expected short term and long term liquidity requirements  our liquidity could also be affected by potential liquidity matters at our owned hotels or joint venture hotels  as discussed below 
mondrian south beach mortgage and mezzanine agreements 
the non recourse mortgage loan and mezzanine loan agreements related to mondrian south beach matured on august  in april  the mondrian south beach joint venture amended the non recourse financing and mezzanine loan agreements secured by mondrian south beach and extended the maturity date for up to seven years through extension options until april  subject to certain conditions 
morgans group and affiliates of our joint venture partner have agreed to provide standard non recourse carve out guaranties and provide certain limited indemnifications for the mondrian south beach mortgage and mezzanine loans 
in the event of a default  the lenders recourse is generally limited to the mortgaged property or related equity interests  subject to standard non recourse carve out guaranties for bad boy type acts 
morgans group and affiliates of our joint venture partner also agreed to guaranty the joint venture s obligation to reimburse certain expenses incurred by the lenders and indemnify the lenders in the event such lenders incur liability as a result of any third party actions brought against mondrian south beach 
morgans group and affiliates of our joint venture partner have also guaranteed the joint venture s liability for the unpaid principal amount of any seller financing note provided for condominium sales if such financing or related mortgage lien is found unenforceable  provided they shall not have any liability if the seller financed unit becomes subject again to the lien of the lender mortgage or title to the seller financed unit is otherwise transferred to the lender or if such seller financing note is repurchased by morgans group and or affiliates of our joint venture at the full amount of unpaid principal balance of such seller financing note 
in addition  although construction is complete and mondrian south beach opened on december   morgans group and affiliates of our joint venture partner may have continuing obligations under construction completion guaranties until all outstanding payables due to construction vendors are paid 
as of december   there are remaining payables outstanding to vendors of approximately million 
we believe that payment under these guaranties is not probable and the fair value of the guarantee is not material 
we and affiliates of our joint venture partner also have an agreement to purchase approximately million each of condominium units under certain conditions  including an event of default 
in the event of a default under the mortgage or mezzanine loan  the joint venture partners are obligated to purchase selected condominium units  at agreed upon sales prices  having aggregate sales prices equal to of the lesser of million  which is the face amount outstanding on the mezzanine loan  or the then outstanding principal balance of the mezzanine loan 
the joint venture is not currently in an event of default under the mortgage or mezzanine loan 
we have not recognized a liability related to the construction completion or the condominium purchase guarantees 
mondrian soho 
the mortgage loan on the mondrian soho property matured in june on july   the loan was amended to  among other things  provide for extensions of the maturity date of the mortgage loan secured by the hotel for up to five years through extension options  subject to certain conditions 
certain affiliates of our joint venture partner have agreed to provide a standard non recourse carve out guaranty for bad boy type acts and a completion guaranty to the lenders for the mondrian soho loan  for which morgans group has agreed to indemnify the joint venture partner and its affiliates up to of such entities guaranty obligations  provided that each party is fully responsible for any losses incurred as a result of its respective gross negligence or willful misconduct 
mondrian soho opened in february  and we are operating the hotel under a year management contract with two year extension options 
we anticipate there may be cash shortfalls from the operations of the hotel and there may not be enough to cover debt service payments going forward  which could require additional contributions by the joint venture partners 
potential litigation 
we may have potential liability in connection with certain claims by a designer for which we have accrued million as of december   as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the probability of losses associated with this claim in excess of the liability that is accrued of million is remote and we cannot reasonably estimate of range of such additional losses  if any  at this time 
other possible uses of capital 
we have a number of development projects signed or under consideration  some of which may require equity investments  key money or credit support from us

table of contents seasonality the hospitality business is seasonal in nature 
for example  our miami hotels are generally strongest in the first quarter  whereas our new york hotels are generally strongest in the fourth quarter 
quarterly revenues also may be adversely affected by events beyond our control  such as the current recession  extreme weather conditions  terrorist attacks or alerts  natural disasters  airline strikes  and other considerations affecting travel 
room revenues by quarter for our owned hotels  excluding our former owned hotel  mondrian scottsdale  which has been excluded from room revenues and classified as discontinued operations  during and  help demonstrate this seasonality  as follows first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter in millions room revenues given the recent global economic downturn  the impact of seasonality in and was not as significant as in prior periods and may remain less pronounced throughout depending on the timing and strength of the economic recovery 
to the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter  due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in revenues  we may have to enter into additional short term borrowings or increase our borrowings  if available  under our amended revolving credit facility to meet cash requirements 
capital expenditures and reserve funds we are obligated to maintain reserve funds for capital expenditures at our owned hotels as determined pursuant to our debt and lease agreements related to such hotels  with the exception of delano south beach  royalton and morgans 
our joint venture hotels and hotel las palapas  which we manage  generally are subject to similar obligations under debt agreements related to such hotels  or under our management agreements 
these capital expenditures relate primarily to the periodic replacement or refurbishment of furniture  fixtures and equipment

table of contents during  and  our owned hotels that were not subject to these reserve funding obligations delano south beach  royalton  and morgans underwent significant room and common area renovations  and as such  are not expected to require a substantial amount of capital during management will evaluate the capital spent at these properties on an individual basis and ensure that such decisions do not impact the overall quality of our hotels or our guests experience 
under the amended revolving credit facility  we are generally prohibited from funding capital expenditures with respect to any hotels owned by us other than maintenance capital expenditures for any hotel not exceeding of the annual gross revenues of such hotel and certain other exceptions 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to the interest rate risks related to our variable rate debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
we determine the fair value of our derivative financial instruments using models which incorporate standard market conventions and techniques such as discounted cash flow and option pricing models to determine fair value 
we believe these methods of estimating fair value result in general approximation of value  and such value may or may not be realized 
on february   we entered into an interest rate forward starting swap that effectively fixed the interest rate on million of mortgage debt at approximately on mondrian los angeles and hudson with an effective date of july  and a maturity date of july  this derivative qualified for hedge accounting treatment per asc  derivatives and hedging asc and accordingly  the change in fair value of this instrument was recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss

these interest rate caps were entered into in august and matured in september of in september  in connection with the amended mortgages  we entered into interest rate caps which qualify for hedge accounting treatment per asc and accordingly  the change in fair value of this instrument is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
additionally  in august  we entered into an interest rate cap on the hudson mezzanine loan which does not qualify for hedge accounting treatment per asc and accordingly  the change in fair value of this instrument is recognized in interest expense 
the fair value of all of these interest rate caps was insignificant as of december  in connection with the sale of the convertible notes  we entered into call options which are exercisable solely in connection with any conversion of the convertible notes and pursuant to which we will receive shares of our common stock from counterparties equal to the number of shares of our common stock  or other property  deliverable by us to the holders of the convertible notes upon conversion of the convertible notes  in excess of an amount of shares or other property with a value  at then current prices  equal to the principal amount of the converted convertible notes 
simultaneously  we also entered into warrant transactions  whereby we sold warrants to purchase in the aggregate  shares of our common stock  subject to customary anti dilution adjustments  at an exercise price of approximately per share of common stock 
the warrants may be exercised over a day trading period commencing january  the call options and the warrants are separate contracts and are not part of the terms of the convertible notes and will not affect the holders rights under the convertible notes 
the call options are intended to offset potential dilution upon conversion of the convertible notes in the event that the market value per share of the common stock at the time of exercise is greater than the exercise price of the call options  which is equal to the initial conversion price of the convertible notes and is subject to certain customary adjustments 

table of contents on october   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with yucaipa american alliance fund ii  lp and yucaipa american alliance parallel fund ii  lp  which we refer to collectively as the investors

the warrants have a year term and are exercisable utilizing a cashless exercise method only  resulting in a net share issuance 
the exercise of the warrants is also subject to an exercise cap which effectively limits the investors beneficial ownership of our common stock to at any one time  unless we are no longer subject to gaming requirements or the investors obtain all necessary gaming approvals to hold and exercise in full the warrants 
the exercise price and number of shares subject to the warrant are both subject to anti dilution adjustments 
we and yucaipa american alliance fund ii  llc  an affiliate of the investors  as the fund manager  also entered into a real estate fund formation agreement on october  pursuant to which we and the fund manager agreed to use good faith efforts to endeavor to raise a private investment fund 
in connection with the agreement  we issued to the fund manager  contingent warrants to purchase our common stock at an exercise price of per share with a year term 
these contingent warrants will only become exercisable if the fund obtains capital commitments in certain amounts over certain time periods and also meets certain further capital commitment and investment thresholds 
the exercise of these contingent warrants is also subject to an exercise cap which effectively limits the fund manager s beneficial ownership which is considered jointly with the investors beneficial ownership of our common stock to at any one time  subject to certain exceptions 
the exercise price and number of shares subject to these contingent warrants are both subject to anti dilution adjustments 
the fund formation agreement terminated by its terms on january  due to the failure to close a fund with million of aggregate capital commitments by that date 
the  contingent warrants issued to the fund manager will be forfeited in their entirety on october  if a fund with million has not closed by that date

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements on june   the fasb issued asc asc amends prior guidance established in fin r and changes the consolidation guidance applicable to a variable interest entity a vie 
it also amends the guidance governing the determination of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie  and is therefore required to consolidate an entity by requiring a qualitative analysis rather than a quantitative analysis 
the qualitative analysis will include  among other things  consideration of who has the power to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance  and who has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie 
this standard also requires continuous reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a vie 
previously  fin r required reconsideration of whether an enterprise was the primary beneficiary of a vie only when specific events had occurred 
qualified special purpose entities  which were previously exempt from the application of this standard  will be subject to the provisions of this standard when it becomes effective 
asc also requires enhanced disclosures about an enterprise s involvement with a vie 
the adoption of this standard on january  did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued asc  generally accepted accounting principles asc 
asc  is a pronouncement establishing the fasb asc as the single official source of authoritative  nongovernmental generally accepted accounting principles 
the asc did not change generally accepted accounting principles but reorganized the literature 
this pronouncement is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  this pronouncement impacts disclosures only and did not have any impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flow 
we adopted certain provisions of asu no 
 which requires additional disclosures for transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements  as well as requiring fair value measurement disclosures for each class of assets and liabilities  a subset of the captions disclosed in our consolidated balance sheets 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or our disclosures  as we did not have any transfers between level and level fair value measurements and did not have material classes of assets and liabilities that required additional disclosure 
we adopted asu no 
subsequent events asc topic amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements in the first quarter of asu no 
removes the requirement for a united states securities and exchange commission registrant to disclose a date  in both issued and revised financial statements  through which that filer had evaluated subsequent events 
accordingly  we removed the disclosure at the date through which that filer had evaluated subsequent events from note to our consolidated financial statements and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued asu no 
business combinations topic to clarify that pro forma disclosures should be presented as if a business combination occurred at the beginning of the prior annual period for purposes of preparing both the current reporting period and the prior reporting period pro forma financial information 
these disclosures should be accompanied by a narrative description about the nature and amount of material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments 
the new asu no 
is effective for business combinations consummated in periods beginning after december   and should be applied prospectively as of the date of adoption 
early adoption is permitted 
we do not believe that the adoption of this guidance will have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb released asu no 
asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts 
the update requires a company to perform step of the goodwill impairment test if the carrying value of the reporting unit is zero or negative and adverse qualitative factors indicate that it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
the qualitative factors to consider are consistent with the existing guidance and examples in topic  which requires that goodwill of a reporting unit be tested for impairment between annual test if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the requirements in asu are effective for public companies in the first annual period beginning after december  asu is not expected to materially impact our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience  information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets 
when triggering events occur  we periodically review each property for possible impairment 
recoverability of such assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset  as determined by applying our operating budgets for future periods 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value 
we estimated each property s fair value using a discounted cash flow method taking into account each property s expected cash flow from operations  holding period and net proceeds from the dispositions of the property 
the factors we address in determining estimated net proceeds from disposition include anticipated operating cash flow in the year of disposition  terminal cash flow capitalization rate and selling price per room 
our judgment is required in determining the discount rate applied to estimated cash flows  the growth rate of the property revenues  and the need for capital expenditures  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
additionally  the classification of these assets as held for sale requires the recording of these assets at our estimate of their fair value less estimated selling costs which can affect the amount of impairment recorded 
as of december   management concluded that its long lived assets were not impaired 
as of december   management concluded that mondrian scottsdale was impaired and that the fair value was in excess of the property s carrying value by approximately million 
additionally  management concluded that the property across the street from delano south beach was impaired and that the fair value was in excess of the property s carrying value by approximately million 
impairment of goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair value of net assets attributable to business acquisitions and combinations 
we test for impairment of goodwill at least annually and at year end 
we will test for impairment more frequently if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other  goodwill  management identifies potential impairments by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its book value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount  including goodwill  the asset is not impaired 
any excess of carrying value over the estimated fair value of goodwill would be recognized as an impairment loss in continuing operations 
management applies a discounted cash flow method to perform its annual goodwill fair value impairment test taking into account approved operating budgets with appropriate growth assumptions  holding period and proceeds from disposing of the property 
in addition to the discounted cash flow analysis  management also considers external independent appraisals to estimate fair value 
the analysis and appraisals used by management are consistent with those used by a market participant 
judgment is required in determining the discount rate applied to estimated cash flows  growth rate of the property revenues  and the need for capital expenditures  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
the discount rate and the terminal cash flow capitalization rate were based on applicable public hotel studies and market indices 
given the current economic environment  management believes that the growth assumptions applied are reasonable 
the company has one reportable operating segment  which is its reporting unit under asc  therefore management aggregates goodwill associated to all owned hotels when analyzing potential impairment 
as of december  and  management concluded that no goodwill impairment existed as the implied fair value of the reporting unit was well in excess of its carrying value 
management does not believe it is reasonably likely that goodwill will become impaired in future periods  but will test before the year end if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets 
the respective lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions made by us  including the cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish our hotels  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
hotel properties and other completed real estate investments are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and generally five years for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
while our management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels or other assets 
we have not changed the estimated useful lives of any of our assets during the periods discussed and believe that the future useful lives of our assets will be consistent with historical trends and experience 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
derivative instruments and hedging activities require us to make judgments on the nature of our derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges 
these judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported as a component of interest expense in the consolidated statements of operations or as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets 
while we believe our judgments are reasonable  a change in a derivative s fair value or effectiveness as a hedge could affect expenses  net income and equity 
additionally  management determines fair value of our derivatives is in accordance with asc  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
the valuation of interest rate caps and interest rate swaps is determined using widely accepted valuation techniques including discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivatives  including the period to maturity  and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves and implied volatilities 
to comply with the provisions of asc  we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both its own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  management has considered the impact of netting and any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts  and guarantees 
management believes that the valuation approach is acceptable and that our derivatives are properly stated at december  and consolidation policy 
variable interest entities are accounted for within the scope of asc and are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary at a variable interest entity is the enterprise that has the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the variable interest entity s economic performance and obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the variable interest entity that could be potentially significant to the variable interest entity 
we evaluate our interests in accordance with asc  consolidation asc to determine if they are variable interests in variable interest entities 
significant judgments and assumptions are made by us to determine whether an entity is a variable interest entity such as those regarding the sufficiency of an entity s equity at risk and whether the entity s equity holders have the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of the entity that most significantly impact its economic performance 
food and beverage operations at three of our owned hotels are operated under joint ventures 
these services include operating restaurants including room service  banquet and catering services 
none of our assets are collateral for the ventures obligations and creditors of the venture have no recourse to us 
based on the evaluation performed  we have concluded we are the primary beneficiary and therefore  we consolidated these three ventures 
we have evaluated the applicability of asc to our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
we have determined that most of these ventures do not meet the requirements of a variable interest entity and some of the ventures meet the requirements of a variable interest entity of which we are not the primary beneficiary and therefore  consolidation of these ventures is not required 
we account for these investments using the equity method as we believe we do not exercise control over significant asset decisions such as buying  selling or financing nor are we the primary beneficiary of the entities 
under the equity method  we increase our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures for our proportionate share of net income and contributions and decrease our investment balance for our proportionate share of net loss and distributions 

table of contents stock based compensation 
we have adopted the fair value method of accounting prescribed in asc  compensation  stock based compensation asc for equity based compensation awards 
asc requires an estimate of the fair value of the equity award at the time of grant rather than the intrinsic value method 
for all fixed equity based awards to employees and directors  which have no vesting conditions other than time of service  the fair value of the equity award at the grant date will be amortized to compensation expense over the award s vesting period on a straight line basis 
for performance based compensation plans  we recognize compensation expense at such time when the performance hurdle is anticipated to be achieved over the performance period based upon the fair value at the date of grant 
the fair value is determined based on the value of our common stock on the grant date of the award  or in the case of stock option awards  the black scholes option pricing model 
management s assumptions when applying the black scholes model are derived based upon the risk profile and volatility of our common stock and our peer group 
we believe that the assumptions that we have applied to stock based compensation are reasonable and we will continue to review such assumptions quarterly and revise them as market conditions change and management deems necessary 
deferred income taxes and valuation allowance 
we account for deferred taxes by recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance will be provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
such valuation allowance will be estimated by management based on our projected future taxable income 
the estimate of future taxable income is highly subjective 
we have a net operating loss for the tax year and anticipate that all or a major portion of the net operating loss will be utilized to offset any future gains on sale of assets 
however  these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur in the future 
to the extent actual results differ from these estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
at december  and  we had a million and million valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevailing market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
some of our outstanding debt has a variable interest rate 
as described in management s discussion and analysis of financial results of operations derivative financial instruments above  we use some derivative financial instruments  primarily interest rate swaps  to manage our exposure to interest rate risks related to our floating rate debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
as of december   our total outstanding consolidated debt  including capital lease obligations  was approximately million  of which approximately million  or  was variable rate debt 
at december   the one month libor rate was 
we had entered into hedging arrangements on million of variable rate debt in connection with the mortgages on hudson and mondrian los angeles  which matured on july  and effectively fixed libor at approximately through that date 
in connection with the mortgages  we had also entered into an million interest rate swap that matured on july  and effectively fixed the libor rate at approximately through that effective date 

table of contents in connection with the amended mortgages  interest rate caps for and  in the amounts of approximately million and million  respectively  were entered into in september  and were outstanding as of december  these interest rate caps mature on october  as of december   we have total debt outstanding  excluding capital lease obligations related to two leased condominium units at hudson  of million of which million or was variable rate debt based on libor spreads 
if market rates of interest on this million variable rate debt increase by  or basis points  the increase in interest expense would reduce future pre tax earnings and cash flows by approximately million annually and the maximum annual amount the interest expense would increase on this variable rate debt is million due to our interest rate cap agreements  which would reduce future pre tax earnings and cash flows by the same amount annually 
if market rates of interest on this million variable rate decrease by  or basis points  the decrease in interest expense would increase pre tax earnings and cash flow by approximately million annually 
as of december   our fixed rate debt of million consisted of the trust notes underlying our trust preferred securities  the convertible notes  the promissory notes on the property across the street from delano south beach  and the clift lease 
the fair value of some of this debt is greater than the book value 
as such  if market rates of interest increase by  or approximately basis points  the fair value of our fixed rate debt at december  would decrease by approximately million 
if market rates of interest decrease by  or basis points  the fair value of our fixed rate debt at december  would increase by million 
in january  in connection with the transfer of such property to su gale property  llc  the million debt on the property across the street from delano south beach was released 
interest risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments and future cash flows 
these analyses do not consider the effect of a reduced level of overall economic activity 
if overall economic activity is significantly reduced  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure 
however  because we cannot determine the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure 
we have entered into agreements with each of our derivative counterparties in connection with our interest rate swaps and hedging instruments related to the convertible notes  providing that in the event we either default or are capable of being declared in default on any of our indebtedness  then we could also be declared in default on our derivative obligations 
currency exchange risk as we have international operations with our two london hotels and the hotel we manage in mexico  currency exchange risks between the us dollar and the british pound and the us dollar and mexican peso  respectively  arise as a normal part of our business 
we reduce these risks by transacting these businesses in their local currency 
as we have a ownership in morgans europe  a change in prevailing rates would have an impact on the value of our equity in morgans europe 
the us dollar british pound and us dollar mexican peso currency exchanges are currently the only currency exchange rates to which we are directly exposed 
generally  we do not enter into forward or option contracts to manage our exposure applicable to net operating cash flows 
we do not foresee any significant changes in either our exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates or how such exposure is managed in the future
