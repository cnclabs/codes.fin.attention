the acquisition is intended to enable us to offer end to end prepaid solutions encompassing branded switching  issuing  processing and program management services  initially focused on the travel sector 
we expect to consummate the acquisition in the first half of business environment we process transactions from more than countries and territories and in more than currencies 
revenue generated in the united states was approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
no individual country  other than the united states  generated more than of total revenues in any period  but differences in market maturity  economic health  price changes and foreign exchange fluctuations in certain countries have increased the proportion of revenues generated outside the united states over time 
while the global nature of our business helps protect our operating results from adverse economic conditions in a single or a few countries  the significant concentration of our revenues generated in the united states makes our business particularly susceptible to adverse economic conditions in the united states 
the competitive and evolving nature of the global payments industry provides both challenges to and opportunities for the continued growth of our business 
unprecedented events which began during impacted the financial markets around the world  including continued distress in the credit environment  continued equity market volatility and additional government intervention 
in particular  the economies of the united states and the united kingdom were significantly impacted by this economic turmoil  and it has also impacted other economies around the world 
more recently  european countries including portugal  ireland  greece and spain have experienced downgrades in sovereign credit ratings by ratings agencies  driven by fiscal challenges 
some existing customers have been placed in receivership or administration or have a significant amount of their stock owned by their governments 
many financial institutions are facing increased regulatory and governmental influence  including potential further changes in laws and regulations 
many of our financial institution customers  merchants that accept our brands and cardholders who use our brands have been directly and adversely impacted 
mastercard s financial results may be negatively impacted by actions taken by individual financial institutions or by governmental or regulatory bodies in response to the economic crisis and the state of economic environments 
the severity of the economic environments may accelerate the timing of or increase the impact of risks to our financial performance that have historically been present 
as a result  our revenue growth has been and may be negatively impacted  or the company may be impacted in several ways  including but not limited to the following declining economies  foreign currency fluctuations and the pace of economic recovery can change consumer spending behaviors  for example  a significant portion of our revenues is dependent on cross border travel patterns  which may continue to change 

table of contents constriction of consumer and business confidence  such as in recessionary environments and those markets experiencing relatively high unemployment  may continue to cause decreased spending by cardholders 
our customers may restrict credit lines to cardholders or limit the issuance of new cards to mitigate increasing cardholder defaults 
uncertainty and volatility in the performance of our customers businesses may make estimates of our revenues  rebates  incentives and realization of prepaid assets less predictable 
our customers may implement cost reduction initiatives that reduce or eliminate payment card marketing or increase requests for greater incentives or greater cost stability 
our customers may decrease spending for optional or enhanced services 
government intervention  including the effect of laws  regulations and or government investments in our customers  may have potential negative effects on our business and our relationships with customers or otherwise alter their strategic direction away from our products 
tightening of credit availability could impact the ability of participating financial institutions to lend to us under the terms of our credit facility 
our customers may default on their settlement obligations 
see note settlement and other risk management to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item for further discussion of our settlement exposure 
our business and prospects  as well as our revenue and profitability  could be materially and adversely affected by consolidation of our customers 
see additional consolidation or other changes in or affecting the banking industry could result in a loss of business for mastercard and create pressure on the fees we charge our customers  resulting in lower prices and or more favorable terms for our customers  which may materially and adversely affect our revenues and profitability in part i  item a risk factors for further discussion 
in addition  our business and our customers businesses are subject to regulation in many countries 
regulatory bodies may seek to impose rules and price controls on certain aspects of our business and the payments industry 
see note legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item and part i  item a risk factors for further discussion 
in particular  in july  the united states enacted into law the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act 
see risk factors legal and regulatory risks the wall street reform and consumer protection act may have a material adverse impact on our revenue  our prospects for future growth and our overall business  financial condition and results of operations in part i  item a for further discussion  including with respect to regulation providing for limitations on debit and prepaid interchange transaction fees  regulation prohibiting exclusive debit network arrangements and routing restrictions for debit and the creation of independent regulatory bodies with the authority to regulate consumer financial products and  potentially  broader aspects of payment card network operations eg  the ability to deem mastercard systematically important 
see also risk factors legal and regulatory risks new regulations in one jurisdiction or of one product may lead to new regulations in other jurisdictions or of other products in part i  item a 
mastercard continues to monitor the extent and pace of economic recovery around the world to identify opportunities for the continued growth of our business and to evaluate the evolution of the global payments industry 
for example  in our asia pacific and latin american regions  we have now experienced several quarters of significant increases in dollar volume of activity on cards carrying our brands in those regions while in the us we have observed mixed economic indicators  including retail spending and unemployment rates 
notwithstanding some encouraging trends  the extent and pace of economic recovery in various regions remains uncertain and the overall business environment may present challenges for mastercard to grow its business

the data for gdv is provided by mastercard customers and includes information with respect to mastercard branded transactions that are not processed by mastercard and for which mastercard does not earn significant revenues 
all data is subject to revision and amendment by mastercard s customers subsequent to the date of its release  which revisions and amendments may be material

all prior period data have been revised to be consistent with this revised methodology 
revenue was not impacted by these changes 
impact of foreign currency rates our overall operating results are impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates  especially the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real 
the functional currency of mastercard europe  our principal european operating subsidiary  is the euro  and the functional currency of our brazilian subsidiary is the brazilian real 
accordingly  the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus the euro and brazilian real impacts the translation of our european and brazilian subsidiaries operating results into the us dollar

the net foreign currency impact of these changes unfavorably impacted net revenue growth by approximately percentage point and favorably impacted expenses by approximately percentage point in for as compared to  the us dollar average exchange rates strengthened against the euro and brazilian real  which resulted in lower revenues and expenses 
in addition  changes in foreign currency exchange rates directly impact the calculation of gross dollar volume and gross euro volume gev  which are used in the calculation of our domestic assessments  cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives 
in most non european regions  gdv is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to us dollars using average exchange rates for the period 
in europe  gev is calculated based on local currency spending volume converted to euros using average exchange rates for the period 
as a result  our domestic assessments  cross border volume fees and volume related rebates and incentives are impacted by the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar versus most non european local currencies and the strengthening or weakening of the euro versus european local currencies 
the strengthening or weakening of the us dollar is evident when gdv on a us dollar converted basis is compared to gdv on a local currency basis

revenues revenue descriptions mastercard s business model involves four participants in addition to us cardholders  merchants  issuers the cardholders banks and acquirers the merchants banks 
our gross revenues are typically based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands  the number of transactions we process for our customers or the nature of other payment related services we provide to our customers 
our revenues are based upon transactional information accumulated by our systems or reported by our customers 
our primary revenue billing currencies are the us dollar  euro and brazilian real 
we process transactions denominated in more than currencies through our global system  providing cardholders with the ability to utilize  and merchants to accept  mastercard cards across multiple country borders 
we process most of the cross border transactions using mastercard  maestro and cirrus branded cards and  among our largest markets  process the majority of mastercard branded domestic transactions in the united states  united kingdom  canada and brazil 
our pricing is complex and is dependent on the nature of the volumes  types of transactions and other products and services we offer to our customers 
a combination of the following factors determines the pricing domestic or cross border 
table of contents signature based credit and off line debit or pin based on line debit  including automated teller machine atm cash withdrawals and retail purchases tiered pricing  with rates decreasing as customers meet incremental volume transaction hurdles geographic region or country retail purchase or cash withdrawal cross border transactions generate greater revenue than do domestic transactions since cross border fees are higher than domestic fees 
we review our pricing and implement pricing changes on an ongoing basis and expect pricing to continue to be a component of revenue growth in the future 
in addition  standard pricing varies among our regional businesses  and such pricing can be customized further for our customers through incentive and rebate agreements 
the company classifies its net revenues into the following five categories domestic assessments domestic assessments are fees charged to issuers and acquirers based primarily on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the merchant country and the cardholder country are the same 
a portion of these assessments is estimated based on aggregate transaction information collected from our systems and projected customer performance and is calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage purchases  cash disbursements  balance transfers and convenience checks from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price 
in addition  domestic assessments include items such as card assessments  which are fees charged on the number of cards issued or assessments for specific purposes  such as acceptance development or market development programs 
acceptance development fees are charged primarily to us issuers based on components of volume  and support our focus on developing merchant relationships and promoting acceptance at the point of sale 
cross border volume fees cross border volume fees are charged to issuers and acquirers based on the volume of activity on cards that carry our brands where the merchant country and the cardholder country are different 
cross border volume fees are calculated by converting the aggregate volume of usage purchases and cash disbursements from local currency to the billing currency and then multiplying by the specific price 
cross border volume fees also include fees  charged to issuers  for performing currency conversion services 
transaction processing fees transaction processing fees are charged for both domestic and cross border transactions and are primarily based on the number of transactions 
these fees are calculated by multiplying the number and type of transactions by the specific price for each service 
transaction processing fees include charges for the following transaction switching authorization  clearing and settlement 
a 
authorization refers to a process in which a transaction is approved by the issuer or  in certain circumstances such as when the issuer s systems are unavailable or cannot be contacted  by mastercard or others on behalf of the issuer in accordance with either the issuer s instructions or applicable rules 
mastercard s rules  which vary across regions  establish the circumstances under which merchants and acquirers must seek authorization of transactions 
fees for authorization are primarily paid by issuers 
b 
clearing refers to the exchange of financial transaction information between issuers and acquirers after a transaction has been completed 
fees for clearing are primarily paid by issuers 
c 
settlement refers to facilitating the exchange of funds between parties 
fees for settlement are primarily paid by issuers 

table of contents connectivity fees are charged to issuers and acquirers for network access  equipment and the transmission of authorization and settlement messages 
these fees are based on the size of the data being transmitted through and the number of connections to the company s network 
other revenues other revenues for other payment related services are primarily dependent on the nature of the products or services provided to our customers but are also impacted by other factors  such as contractual agreements 
examples of other revenues are fees associated with the following fraud products and services used to prevent or detect fraudulent transactions 
this includes warning bulletin fees which are charged to issuers and acquirers for listing invalid or fraudulent accounts either electronically or in paper form and for distributing this listing to merchants 
cardholder services fees are for benefits provided with mastercard branded cards  such as insurance  telecommunications assistance for lost cards and locating automated teller machines 
consulting and research fees are primarily generated by mastercard advisors  the company s professional advisory services group 
the company s business agreements with certain customers and merchants may include consulting services as an incentive 
the contra revenue associated with these incentives is included in rebates and incentives 
the company also charges for a variety of other payment related services  including compliance and penalty fees  account and transaction enhancement services  holograms and publications 
rebates and incentives contra revenue rebates and incentives are provided to certain mastercard customers and are recorded as contra revenue in the same period that performance occurs 
performance periods vary depending on the type of rebate or incentive  including commitments to the agreement term  hurdles for volumes  transactions or issuance of new cards and the launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs 
rebates and incentives are calculated based on estimated performance  the timing of new and renewed agreements and the terms of the related business agreements

seasonality historically  our quarterly gross revenues have been positively impacted in the fourth quarter by increases in purchase volume related to the holiday shopping period  with corresponding higher rebates and incentives to our customers 
also  operating expenses have historically been higher in the fourth quarter due to additional advertising and promotions related to the holiday period 
the economic crisis in caused our operating results to diverge from these historical trends as gross revenues in the fourth quarter of were negatively impacted by lower purchase volumes and transactions 
in response  mastercard accelerated its cost savings initiatives in the quarter  with particular focus on advertising  personnel and travel expenses 
the results for the fourth quarters of and were more consistent with the historical trends 
critical accounting estimates our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures to ensure that the methods used to make estimates and assumptions are well controlled and are applied consistently from period to period 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management judgments 
financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions revenue recognition domestic assessments require an estimate of our customers quarterly gdv or gev to recognize quarterly domestic assessments 
domestic assessments included an estimate representing of total domestic assessments in each of  and and of total net revenues in  and our revenue recognition policies are fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
customers gdv and gev are estimated by using historical performance  transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers 
such estimates are subsequently validated against the gdv or gev reported by our customers 
differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports 
if customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance  realized revenues may be materially different than initially estimated 
historically  our estimates have differed from the actual performance by less than of the estimates on a quarterly basis 

table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions rebates and incentives are generally recorded as contra revenue based on our estimate of each customer s performance in a given period and according to the terms of the related customer agreements 
examples of the customer performance items requiring estimation include gdv or gev  transactions  issuance of new cards  launch of new programs or the execution of marketing programs 
in addition  certain customer agreements include prepayment of rebates and incentives 
amortization of prepayments and other assets may be on straight line basis over the life of the agreement or based on customer performance depending on the terms of the related customer agreements 
our estimates of each customer s performance are based on historical customer performance  transactional information accumulated from our systems and discussions with our customers 
such estimates are subsequently validated by information reported by our customers 
differences are adjusted in the period the customer reports 
if customers actual performance is not consistent with our estimates of their performance  contra revenues may be materially different than initially estimated 
legal and regulatory matters we are party to legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters 
except as described in note obligations under litigation settlements and note legal and regulatory proceedings to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report  mastercard does not believe that any legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party would have a material adverse impact on its business or prospects 
we evaluate the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of the legal or regulatory proceedings to which we are party 
our judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings  the merits of our defenses and consultation with in house and outside legal counsel 
due to the inherent uncertainties of the legal and regulatory process in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate  our judgments may be materially different than the actual outcomes 

table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions income taxes in calculating our effective tax rate  we need to make estimates regarding the timing and amount of taxable and deductible items which will adjust the pretax income earned in various tax jurisdictions 
through our interpretation of local tax regulations  adjustments to pretax income for income earned in various tax jurisdictions are reflected within various tax filings 
although we believe that our estimates and judgments discussed herein are reasonable  actual results may differ by a material amount 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if it is determined that we are able to realize deferred tax assets in excess of the net carrying value or to the extent we are unable to realize a deferred tax asset  we would adjust the valuation allowance with a corresponding increase or decrease to earnings 
we record tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  which may not be sustained or may only be partially sustained  upon examination by the relevant taxing authorities 
we considered all relevant facts and current authorities in the tax law in assessing whether any benefit resulting from an uncertain tax position was more likely than not to be sustained and  if so  how current law impacts the amount reflected within these financial statements 
if upon examination  we realize a tax benefit which is not fully sustained or is more favorably sustained  this would decrease or increase earnings in the period 
in certain situations  the company will have offsetting tax credits or taxes in other jurisdictions 
we do not record us income tax expense for foreign earnings which we intend to reinvest indefinitely to expand our international operations 
we considered business plans  planning opportunities  and expected future outcomes in assessing the needs for future expansion and support of our international operations 
if our business plans change or our future outcomes differ from our expectations  us income tax expense and our effective tax rate could increase or decrease in that period 
asset impairment analyses prepaid customer and merchant incentives we prepay certain customer and merchant business incentives 
in the event of customer or merchant business failure  these incentives may not have future economic benefits for our business 
impairment analysis is performed quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the impairment analysis for each customer requires an estimation of our customer s future performance and an assessment of the agreement terms to determine the future net cash flows expected from the customer agreement 
our estimates of customer performance are based on historical customer performance  discussions with our customer and our expectations for the future 
if events or changes in circumstances occur  additional impairment charges related to our prepaid customer and merchant incentives may be incurred 
the carrying value of prepaid customer and merchant incentives was million at december  
table of contents financial statement caption critical accounting estimate assumptions approach used effect if actual results differ from assumptions goodwill and intangible assets excluding capitalized software we perform analyses of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis or sooner if indicators of impairment exist 
we review intangible assets with finite lives for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
goodwill and intangible assets are assigned to our reporting units 
the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to the carrying value of the respective reporting unit 
our goodwill policies are fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
we utilized a weighted income and market approach for determining the fair values of our reporting units 
our significant valuation related judgments related to goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests include  as applicable  forecasting cash flows  selection of discount rates and selection of comparable companies 
we used both internal and external data to make these judgments 
if market conditions or business conditions change in the future  we may be exposed to impairment charges associated with goodwill and or intangible assets 
the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets  excluding capitalized software  was million  including million of unamortizable customer relationships  as of december  we determined that the majority of our customer relationships  which are intangible assets  have indefinite lives 
in addition to the impairment testing noted above  we assess the appropriateness of that indefinite life annually 
we used internal data and estimates regarding changes in our customer relationships and future cash flows to assess the indefinite life and assess fair value 
if a definite life is deemed to be more appropriate  it would require amortization of the customer relationships which would result in a decline in future net income 
recent accounting pronouncements transfers of financial assets in june  the accounting standard for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities was amended
