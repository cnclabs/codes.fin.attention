overview we are a leading north american manufacturer of large diameter  high pressure steel pipeline systems for use in water infrastructure applications  primarily related to drinking water systems  and we also manufacture other welded steel pipe products for use in a wide range of applications  including energy  construction  agriculture  industrial and traffic signpost systems 
our pipeline systems are also used for hydroelectric power systems  wastewater systems and other applications 
we also make products for industrial plant piping systems and certain structural applications 
these pipeline systems are produced by our water transmission group from seven manufacturing facilities located in portland  oregon  denver  colorado  adelanto  california  parkersburg  west virginia  saginaw  texas  pleasant grove  utah  and monterrey  mexico 
our water transmission group accounted for approximately of net sales in in february  we announced a temporary shutdown of our utah facility 
we installed a new mill at that facility and resumed operations in june we have also invested in an unconsolidated subsidiary  northwest pipe asia  located in singapore that produces steel pipe mills 
our water infrastructure products are sold generally to installation contractors  who include our products in their bids to municipal agencies or privately owned water companies for specific projects 
we believe our sales are substantially driven by spending on new water infrastructure with a recent trend towards spending on water infrastructure replacement  repair and upgrade 
within the total range of pipe products  our products tend to fit the larger diameter  higher pressure applications 
our tubular products group manufactures other welded steel products in three facilities atchison  kansas  houston  texas  and starting in bossier city  louisiana 
we produce a range of products used in several different markets 
we currently make pipe for a wide variety of uses  including energy  industrial  construction  agriculture  and traffic signpost systems  which are sold to distributors and used in many different applications 
our tubular products group generated approximately of our net sales in our tubular products group s sales volume is typically driven by energy spending  non residential construction spending  highway spending and general economic conditions 
we currently believe the greatest potential for significant sales growth in our tubular products group is through our energy products which includes line pipe and oil country tubular goods 
our current economic environment we are monitoring the current economic environment  and we believe there are substantial growth opportunities based on key factors impacting demand for our products 
although the recent economic slowdown 
table of contents had the biggest impact on our tubular products group  the recovery of the energy markets has had a positive impact on our tubular products business  as oil and natural gas exploration and production companies continue to restart rig operations and increase explorations 
additionally  in april  the us department of commerce imposed tariffs on oil country tubular goods imported from china 
chinese steel suppliers recently held as much as of the oil country tubular goods import market 
with regard to our water transmission group  we operate our business with a long term time horizon 
projects are often planned for many years in advance  and are sometimes part of fifty year build out plans 
however  in the near term  we expect strained governmental and water agency budgets will impact the water transmission group 
fluctuating steel costs will be a factor in both our tubular products group and our water transmission group  as the ability to adjust our selling prices as steel costs fluctuate will depend on market conditions 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
management estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate all of our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization  goodwill  accrued liabilities  income taxes  and litigation and other contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and related judgments and estimates affect the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from construction contracts in our water transmission group is recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the costs incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total costs of each contract cost to cost method 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and depreciation 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
the cost of steel is recognized as a project cost when the steel is introduced into the manufacturing process 
estimated total costs of each contract are reviewed on a monthly basis by project management and operations personnel for substantially all projects that are or more complete except that major projects  usually over million  are reviewed earlier if sufficient production has been completed to provide enough information to revise the original estimated total cost of the project 
all cost revisions that result in the gross profit as a percent of sales increasing or decreasing by more than two percent are reviewed by senior management personnel 
we begin recognizing revenue on a project when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement and project costs are incurred 
costs may be incurred before we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
in those cases  if we believe we will obtain persuasive evidence of an arrangement and if recoverability from that arrangement is probable  the project costs are deferred and revenue recognition is delayed 
provisions for losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period such losses are known 
changes in job performance  job conditions and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  foreign currency exchange rate movements  and final contract settlements may result in revisions to revenue  costs and income and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
historically  our estimates of total job costs for each job have been reasonably dependable 

table of contents revenue from our tubular products group is recognized when all four of the following criteria have been satisfied persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery has occurred  and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments based on historical experience and management s judgment 
the extension and revision of credit is established by obtaining credit rating reports or financial information on the customer 
an allowance is recorded based on a variety of factors  including our historical collection experience and our historical product warranty claims 
at least monthly  we review past due balances to identify the reasons for non payment 
we will write off a receivable account once the account is deemed uncollectible for reasons such as a bankruptcy filing  deterioration in the customer s financial position  contract dispute or other similar events 
we believe the reported allowances at december  are adequate 
if the customers financial conditions were to deteriorate resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may need to be recorded which would result in additional expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
goodwill goodwill related to our tubular products group  one of our operating segments and reporting units  represents the excess of cost over the assigned value of the net assets in connection with the segment s acquisitions 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually at december or whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the tubular products group below its carrying amount 
fair value of the tubular products group s goodwill is determined with consideration of the income  market  and cost approaches as applicable 
for and  fair value of goodwill was estimated under the income approach and the market approach 
we do not utilize the cost approach as relevant data is not available 
we utilize an average of the income and market approaches  with a heavier weighting on the income approach because of the relatively limited number of comparable entities for which relevant multiples are available 
the income approach is based upon projected future after tax cash flows less capital expenditures discounted to present value using factors that consider the timing and risk associated with the future after tax cash flows 
the key assumptions in the discounted cash flow analysis are the long term growth rate  the discount rate  and the annual free cash flow 
the discount rate used for was which reflects the company s estimated weighted average cost of capital 
the market approach is based upon historical and forward looking measures using multiples of revenue and a price to book ratio 
the forward looking measures are more heavily weighted than the historical measures 
we also utilize a sensitivity analysis to determine the impact of changes in discount rates and cash flow forecasts on the valuation of the tubular operating segment 
the valuation of the tubular products group significantly exceeded its carrying value at december  accordingly  no further valuation of the segment was necessary 
if our assumptions about goodwill change as a result of events or circumstances  and management believes the assets may have declined in value  then impairment charges will be recorded  resulting in lower profits 
the operations of the tubular products group are cyclical and its sales and profitability may fluctuate from year to year 
in the evaluation of our operating segment  we look at the long term prospects for the reporting unit and recognize that current performance may not be the best indicator of future prospects or value  which requires management judgment 
long lived assets property and equipment are recorded at cost 
we depreciate the net book value in excess of the salvage value using either the units of production method or a straight line method depending on the classification of the 
table of contents asset 
we assess impairment of property and equipment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable 
the recoverable value of long lived assets is determined by estimating future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about our expected future operating performance 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flow due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  or changes to our business operations 
if we determine the carrying value of the property and equipment will not be recoverable  we calculate and record an impairment loss 
due to the nature of our manufacturing process and the equipment used in the process  our machinery and equipment assets are long lived and the risk of obsolescence is low 
each of our facilities has equipment that is interchangeable  as the same product can  for the most part  be produced at any one of our facilities 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
determining market value of inventories involves judgments and assumptions made by us  including projecting selling prices and cost of sales 
to project market value  we review recent sales and gross profit history  existing customer orders  current contract prices  industry supply and demand  forecasted steel prices  replacement costs  seasonal factors  general economic trends and other information  as applicable 
if future market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  inventory write downs may be required 
at december   the inventory balance of million is reported net of lower of cost or market adjustments totaling million 
raw material inventories of steel are stated at cost either on a specific identification basis or on an average cost basis 
all other raw materials  as well as supplies  are stated on an average cost basis 
finished goods are stated at cost using the first in  first out method of accounting 
income taxes we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
the determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
our provision for income taxes primarily reflects a combination of income earned and taxed in the various us federal and state and  to a lesser extent  foreign jurisdictions 
jurisdictional tax law changes  increases or decreases in permanent differences between book and tax items  accruals or adjustments of accruals for unrecognized tax benefits or valuation allowances  and our change in the mix of earnings from these taxing jurisdictions all affect the overall effective tax rate 
we record tax reserves for federal  state  local and international exposures relating to periods subject to audit 
the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues  potential outcomes and timing  and is a subjective estimate 
we assess our tax positions and record tax benefits for all years subject to examination based upon management s evaluation of the facts  circumstances  and information available at the reporting dates 
for those tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  we have recorded the largest amount of tax benefit with a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement with a tax authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
for those tax positions where it is not more likely than not that a tax benefit will be sustained  no tax benefit has been recognized in the financial statements 
derivative instruments we conduct business in various foreign countries  and  from time to time  settle our transactions in foreign currencies 
we have established a program that utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures  typically arising from sales contracts 
table of contents denominated in canadian currency 
these derivative contracts are consistent with our strategy for financial risk management  however  prior to june   they did not meet the conditions under the authoritative guidance to qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
beginning in the quarter ended september   we adopted hedge accounting treatment for qualifying foreign currency forward contracts entered into subsequent to june  instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment are re measured at fair value on each balance sheet date and resulting gains and losses are recognized in net income 
foreign currency transactions assets and liabilities subject to foreign currency fluctuations are translated into united states dollars at the period end exchange rate  and revenue and expenses are translated at the exchange rate representing an average for the period 
translation adjustments from our designated hedges are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of stockholders equity 
gains or losses on all other foreign currency transactions are recognized in the statement of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain financial information regarding costs and expenses expressed as a percentage of total net sales and net sales of our business segments 
year ended december  net sales water transmission tubular products total net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating loss income other income expense interest income interest expense loss income before income taxes benefit provision for income taxes net loss income segment gross profit loss as a percentage of net sales water transmission tubular products year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales increased by million to million in from million in no single customer accounted for or more of total net sales in or water transmission sales increased to million in from million in the increase in net sales was due to a increase in tons produced partially offset by a decrease in the selling price per ton 
the increase in volume represents a return to operating levels after a low volume year in in industrial and municipal water transmission projects 
approximately one half of the increased production resulted from the restart of our pleasant grove facility during bidding activity  backlog and production 
table of contents levels may vary significantly from period to period affecting sales volumes 
the decrease in selling prices per ton was due to a decline in steel costs 
lower steel costs generally lead to lower contract values 
steel costs are discussed further in the gross profit analysis 
tubular products sales increased to million in from million in the sales increase was due to a increase in tons sold partially offset by a decline in selling price per ton 
the most significant increase in demand was the result of increases in oil and natural gas drilling operations  with energy pipe representing of the total tubular product volume increase 
with the increase in demand  we installed manufacturing equipment in our bossier city  louisiana facility in  increasing our capacity for energy pipe 
while demand increased  selling prices per ton decreased as the volume of imported energy pipe increased early in as trade cases took effect in  the volume of imported energy pipe decreased in the second half of which caused sales prices per ton to rise  reversing most of the sales price decrease earlier in the year 
in  energy pipe sales volume increased compared to gross profit 
gross profit increased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in water transmission gross profit increased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in the increase in gross profit from the prior year was due to increased production volume which lowered unit costs in as compared to in addition  our water transmission materials cost per ton  including steel  decreased in by approximately from we anticipate gross margin to increase slightly in compared to  as the remaining lower margin projects awarded in which flowed through the income statement will have less impact in gross profit from tubular products increased to million of segment net sales in from a loss of million of segment net sales in as noted above  demand for our tubular products increased significantly  particularly for our energy products which had sales revenue of million in and increased to million in the significant increase in volume contributed to the increase in gross profit in  as market conditions led to higher production which reduced our fixed costs per ton  although this was partially offset by higher steel costs per ton of in compared to the increase in gross profit from the prior year was also impacted by our inventory lower of cost or market adjustment  which decreased million in additional information regarding our exposure to volatile steel prices is set forth in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the increase of million as compared to the prior year consisted of an increase in professional fees of million associated with the audit committee investigation of certain accounting matters  an increase of million in tubular products sales commission expense  and an increase of approximately million in severance costs related to the departure of our president in october other income expense 
other income decreased primarily due to decreased equity earnings in northwest pipe asia  partially offset by insurance proceeds related to a fire at our pleasant grove facility 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million in from million in the increase in interest expense was a result of higher average borrowings at higher average interest rates 
income taxes 
our effective tax benefit rate was and in and  respectively 
the decrease in the benefit rate was primarily attributable to a reduction in of previously claimed manufacturing deductions under internal revenue code section due to the anticipated carryback of our tax loss for to 
table of contents prior years  we are required to forego the manufacturing deductions taken in those prior years 
our effective income tax rate can change significantly depending on the relationship of permanent income tax deductions and tax credits to pre tax income or loss 
accordingly  the comparison of effective rates between periods is not necessarily meaningful in all situations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased by million to million in from million in no single customer accounted for or more of total net sales in or water transmission sales decreased to million in from million in the decline in net sales was due to an decrease in tons produced and a decrease in the selling price per ton 
the decrease in volume was due to reduced demand for production of industrial and municipal water transmission projects 
bidding activity  backlog and production levels may vary significantly from period to period affecting sales volumes 
the decrease in selling prices per ton was due to more aggressive bidding activity  resulting from reduced demand in  as well as a decline in steel prices 
lower steel costs generally lead to lower contract values 
steel prices are discussed further in the gross profit analysis 
tubular products sales decreased to million in from million in the sales decrease was due to a decrease in tons sold and a decline in selling price per ton 
all tubular product lines were negatively impacted in the most significant reductions in demand were the result of decreases in natural gas drilling operations and lower residential and commercial construction activity 
approximately of the total decrease in net sales over the prior year was due to our three largest product lines  with energy pipe  standard pipe and structural pipe product lines comprising  and of the decrease  respectively 
the sharp decline in sales of our energy pipe  standard pipe and structural pipe product lines was related to decreases in both volume and price 
we sold fewer tons of energy pipe products in and our price per ton decreased in as compared to standard pipe sales volumes decreased and our price per ton decreased in as compared to our structural pipe sales volume decreased and the price per ton declined in as compared to gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million of total net sales in from million of total net sales in water transmission gross profit decreased to million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in the drop in gross profit from the prior year was due to more aggressive bidding activity leading to lower selling prices per ton  as well as a reduction in tons produced in as compared to we incurred fixed production costs which we were unable to absorb due to the decreased total project volume of approximately in as compared to the prior year 
our water transmission materials cost per ton  including steel  decreased in by approximately from in addition  our inventory values for water transmission products reflect a lower of cost or market expense of million for the year gross profit from tubular products decreased to a loss of million of segment net sales in from million of segment net sales in as noted above  demand for our tubular products decreased significantly  particularly for our energy products which sustained a reduction in sales as compared to the prior year 
the significant decrease in volume contributed to the loss in  as the market conditions led to reduced production and our inability to fully cover our fixed costs 
this was partially offset by decreased steel costs per ton of in as compared to unlike our water transmission segment  contracts for our tubular products are able to be fulfilled in a relatively short time frame  typically within one to three months 
therefore  price changes are more quickly reflected in sales prices and gross profit 
in addition  our inventory values for tubular products reflect a lower of cost or market expense of million for the year 
table of contents additional information regarding our exposure to volatile steel prices is set forth in item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  to million of net sales in from million of net sales in the decrease of million as compared to the prior year consisted of a decrease of million in wages  bonus and benefit expense as a result of weaker financial performance  a decrease of million in tubular products sales commission expense  a decrease of approximately million in travel  entertainment and other administration expenses as a result of cost containment measures  and a decrease of approximately million in outside services and professional fees 
in addition  we incurred a loss of million on retired assets in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in professional fees of million associated with the audit committee investigation of certain accounting matters 
other income expense 
other income increased primarily due to the equity earnings in northwest pipe asia 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease in interest expense was a result of lower average borrowings at lower average interest rates 
income taxes 
our effective tax benefit rate was in and our effective tax expense was approximately in the change in our effective tax rate was mainly due to an increase in the valuation allowance related to section net operating losses  and an increase in excess non deductible officer s compensation earned in but paid in liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash our principal sources of liquidity generally include operating cash flow and our bank credit agreement 
from time to time our long term capital needs may be met through the issuance of long term debt or additional equity 
our principal uses of liquidity generally include capital expenditures  working capital and debt service 
information regarding our cash flows for the twelve months ended december  is presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows contained in this form k  and is further discussed below 
as of december   our working capital current assets minus current liabilities was million as compared to million as of december  cash and cash equivalents totaled  as of december  and  as of december  net cash used in operating activities in was million 
this was primarily the result of fluctuations in our working capital accounts  which result from timing differences between production  shipment and invoicing of our products  as well as changes in levels of production and costs of materials 
we typically have a relatively large investment in working capital  as we are generally obligated to pay for goods and services early in the project while cash is not received until much later in the project 
our revenues in the water transmission segment are recognized on a percentage of completion method  therefore  there is little correlation between revenue and cash receipts and the elapsed time can be significant 
as such  our payment cycle is a significantly shorter interval than our collection cycle  although the effect of this difference in the cycles may vary from period to period 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  primarily related to capital expenditures of million 
the most significant capital projects in were the new mill installation at our water transmission s utah facility and preparation and installation of manufacturing equipment in our bossier city  louisiana facility to manufacture oil country tubular goods 
capital expenditures in are expected to be approximately million to million for standard capital replacement and recently announced strategic investment projects 
these include an expansion at our atchison  kansas facility that will increase its production 
table of contents capacity by more than  improve productivity and enable the facility to produce product up to inch wall 
in addition  we are upgrading our houston  texas mill to facilitate production of and inch tubing with physical properties suitable for heat treating 
net cash provided by financing activities in was million  primarily due to a million net increase in our line of credit  partially offset by a decrease in long term debt balances outstanding of million and payment of debt amendment costs of million 
we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents  cash flows expected to be generated by operations  and amounts available under our credit agreements will be adequate to fund our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we also expect to continue to rely on cash generated from operations and other sources of available funds to make required principal payments under our long term debt during to the extent necessary  we may also satisfy capital requirements through additional bank borrowings  senior notes  term notes  subordinated debt  and capital and operating leases  if such resources are available on satisfactory terms 
see the discussion below under line of credit and long term debt for a discussion of recent developments regarding compliance with the terms of our credit agreements 
we have from time to time evaluated and continue to evaluate opportunities for acquisitions and expansion 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of our working capital or necessitate additional bank borrowings or other sources of funding 
line of credit and long term debt we had the following significant components of debt at december  a million amended and restated credit agreement  under which million was outstanding  million of series a term note  million of series b term notes  million of series c term notes  and million of series d term notes 
the credit agreement expires on may   and bears interest at rates related to libor plus to  or the lending institution s prime rate  plus to

the company had additional net borrowing capacity under the line of credit of million at december  the series a term note in the principal amount of million matures on february  and requires annual payments in the amount of million plus interest of paid quarterly on february  may  august and november the series b term notes in the principal amount of million mature on june  and require annual payments in the amount of million plus interest of paid quarterly on march  june  september and december the series c term notes in the principal amount of million mature on october  and require annual payments of million plus interest of paid quarterly on january  april  july and october the series d term notes in the principal amount of million mature on january  and require annual payments in the amount of  plus interest of paid quarterly on january  april  july and october the series a term note  the series b term notes  the series c term notes  and the series d term notes together  the term notes are collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory and certain equipment 
we had an million capital lease outstanding at december   under which certain equipment used in the manufacturing process is leased 
the average interest rate on the capital lease is 

table of contents our capital lease outstanding as of december  consists of an agreement entered into as of september to finance our bossier city  louisiana facility the financing arrangement 
as part of the financing arrangement  a million escrow account was provided for the company by a local government entity through a financial institution and funds are released upon qualifying purchase requisitions 
as we purchase equipment for the facility  we enter into a sale leaseback transaction with the governmental entity as part of the financing arrangement 
as of december   million was held in the escrow account  which is included in other assets  as a result of proceeds from the financing arrangement 
the financing arrangement requires us to meet certain loan covenants  measured at the end of each fiscal quarter 
these loan covenants follow the covenants required by our credit agreement 
the credit agreement  the term notes and our capital lease place various restrictions on our ability to  among other things  incur certain additional indebtedness  create liens or other encumbrances on assets  and incur additional capital expenditures 
the credit agreement  term notes  and our capital lease require us to be in compliance with certain financial covenants 
our operating results led us to commence discussions in the fourth quarter of with our bank creditors to obtain waivers of our financial covenants as of december   march  and june  as a result of these discussions  covenant waivers were obtained and we entered into amendments to our amended and restated credit agreement and amended and restated note purchase and private shelf agreement during the amendments changed the definition  method of application and amounts of the covenants related to the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  consolidated senior leverage ratio  consolidated total leverage ratio  consolidated tangible net worth  asset coverage ratio  minimum consolidated ebitda  and maximum consolidated rental and operating lease expense to consolidated revenue ratio 
in accordance with the requirements  the consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio will next be calculated as of june  the results of our financial covenants as of december  are below 
the consolidated senior leverage ratio must not be greater than our ratio as of december  is the consolidated total leverage ratio must not be greater than our ratio as of december  is the consolidated tangible net worth must be greater than million 
our tangible net worth as of december  is million 
the asset coverage ratio cannot be less than our ratio as of december  is the minimum consolidated ebitda cannot be less than million as of december  our consolidated ebitda is million 
the consolidated rental and operating lease expense to consolidated revenue ratio must not be greater than 
our ratio as of december  is 
based on our business plan and forecasts of operations  we believe we will remain in compliance with our amended covenants in 
table of contents the following table sets forth our scheduled contractual commitments that will affect our future liquidity as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years credit agreement the term notes capital lease operating leases interest payments total obligations these amounts represent future interest payments related to our debt obligations  excluding the credit agreement 
due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with our unrecognized tax benefits at december   we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  approximately  in uncertain tax positions has been excluded from the contractual table above
