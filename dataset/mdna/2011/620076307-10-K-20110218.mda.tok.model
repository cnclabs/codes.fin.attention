table of contents item a risk factors we wish to caution the reader that the following important risk factors  and those risk factors described elsewhere in this report or in our other securities and exchange commission filings  could cause our actual results to differ materially from those stated in forward looking statements contained in this document and elsewhere 
these risks are not presented in order of importance or probability of occurrence 
we are at risk that the sale of the majority of our networks infrastructure assets is further delayed or does not close 
we face risks and uncertainties related to the sale of a majority of our networks infrastructure assets to nokia siemens networks bv nsn  which includes i our ability to satisfy the conditions to closing  including a receipt of china antitrust approval  b the absence of any judgment  writ or order preventing the sale or other legal proceeding which is likely to render it impossible or unlawful to consummate the sale  and c the absence of a material adverse effect on the assets being sold by us  ii each company having the ability to consummate the transaction  iii the impact on our performance and financial results deriving from the benefits from this transaction  and iv the expected timeline for completing the transaction 
the closing of such sale has been delayed beyond our initial expectations due to a delay in receipt of china antitrust approval 
in addition  we are currently engaged in litigation with huawei  a chinese competitor of our networks business  who filed for a preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the transfer of certain product lines  employees  and its confidential information to nsn in connection with the sale of our networks business 
we are currently subject to a temporary restraining order which prohibits the transfer of huawei confidential information to nsn and are waiting on the courts ruling on the preliminary injunction motion 
there can be no assurance that the sale will be completed 
if the sale is not completed as currently contemplated it may impact our ability to execute on our long term strategic plan 
there are various other uncertainties and risks relating to this proposed sale that could have  and in some cases have had  a negative impact on our business operations  operating results or assets  including i the distraction of management and disruption of operations  ii difficulties in recruiting and retaining employees in the networks business  iii perceived uncertainties as to our future direction that have a negative impact on our relationships with our customers  suppliers  vendors and partners and resulting in the loss of business opportunities  iv interference by certain competitors with certain customers  and v the process of completing the sale has been time consuming and expensive 
our financial results have been and could further be negatively impacted if sales of our networks infrastructure equipment continue to decline in response to our agreement to sell the majority of our networks infrastructure assets 
we have experienced declines in the sale of certain of our networks infrastructure equipment as a result of the announcement of our agreement to sell the majority of our networks infrastructure assets to nsn 
our future financial results could be further negatively impacted if sales of our networks infrastructure equipment continue to decline in response to our pending sale 
we expect to operate the networks business until the closing of the sale to nsn and the company s financial results could be further negatively impacted if sales are not at expected levels due to perceived uncertainty as a result of the pending sale 
the uncertainty of current economic and political conditions makes budgeting and forecasting very difficult and may reduce demand for our products 
current conditions in the domestic and world economies remain uncertain 
this is particularly true of us governmental customers budgetary conditions 
as a result of global economic conditions  us unemployment levels and ongoing political conflicts in the middle east and elsewhere have created many economic and political uncertainties that have impacted worldwide markets 
as a result  it is difficult to estimate changes in various parts of the us and world economy  including the markets in which we participate 
because all components of our budgeting and forecasting are dependent upon estimates of demand for our products  the prevailing economic uncertainties render estimates of future income and expenditures difficult 
we have engineering resources in israel that could be disrupted as a result of hostilities in the region 
we also sell our products and services throughout the middle east and demand for our products and services could be negatively impacted by political conflicts and hostilities in this region 
the potential for future unrest  terrorist 
table of contents attacks  increased global conflicts and the escalation of existing conflicts has created worldwide uncertainties that have negatively impacted  and may continue to negatively impact  demand for certain of our products 
we continue to face a number of risks related to current global economic conditions  including adverse credit conditions  low economic growth  risk of sovereign defaults and high levels of unemployment 
global economic conditions and financial markets continue to be challenging to the government and enterprise communications market  as many economies and financial markets remain in a recession resulting from a number of factors  including adverse credit conditions  low economic growth rates  risk of sovereign defaults  particularly in certain european countries  continuing high rates of unemployment  reduced corporate capital spending and other factors 
economic growth in the us and many other countries has remained very low and the length of time these adverse economic conditions may persist are unknown 
these global economic conditions have impacted and could continue to impact our business in a number of ways  including potential deferment or cancellation of purchases and orders by customers uncertainty about current and future global economic conditions may cause  and in some cases has caused businesses and governments to defer or cancel purchases in response to tighter credit and decreased cash availability and declining consumer confidence 
if future demand for our products declines due to global economic conditions  it will negatively impact our financial results 
customers inability to obtain financing to make purchases from motorola solutions and or maintain their business some of our customers require substantial financing  including public financing or government grants  in order to fund their operations and make purchases from us 
the inability of these customers to obtain sufficient credit or other funds to finance purchases of our products and or meet their payment obligations to us could have  and in some cases has had  a negative impact on our financial results 
in addition  if global economic conditions result in insolvencies for our customers  it will negatively impact our financial results 
requests by customers for vendor financing by motorola solutions certain of the company s customers  particularly  but not limited to  those who purchase large infrastructure systems  request that their suppliers provide financing in connection with equipment purchases 
in response to limited availability of financing from banks and other lenders  these types of requests have increased in volume and scope 
motorola solutions  particularly in its networks business  has continued to provide financing in light of these requests and a continuation of the credit market dislocation could force us to choose between further increasing our level of vendor financing or potentially losing sales to these customers 
negative impact from increased financial pressures on third party dealers  distributors and retailers we make sales in certain regions through third party dealers  distributors and retailers 
although many of these third parties have significant operations and maintain access to available credit  others are smaller and more likely to be impacted by the significant decrease in available credit that resulted from the financial crisis and continues today 
if credit pressures or other financial difficulties result in insolvency for important third parties and we are unable to successfully transition end customers to purchase our products from other third parties or from us directly  it may cause  and in some cases has caused  a negative impact on our financial results 
negative impact from increased financial pressures on key suppliers our ability to meet customers demands depends  in part  on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials  parts and components from our suppliers 
certain of our components are available only from a single source or limited sources 
if certain single source or limited source suppliers were to become capacity constrained or insolvent  it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies or an increase in the price of supplies and negatively impact our financial results 
in addition  credit constraints at single source suppliers have resulted in accelerated payment of accounts payable by us  impacting our cash flow 
if this trend continues  it will negatively impact our cash flow 
increased risk of financial counterparty failures could negatively impact our financial position the company uses derivative financial instruments to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to these derivative financial instruments 
although the contracts are distributed among several 
table of contents leading financial institutions  all of whom presently have investment grade credit ratings  the default by one or more counterparty could have a material adverse impact on our financial statements 
returns on pension and retirement plan assets and interest rate changes could affect our earnings and cash flow in future periods the funding position of our pension plans is affected by the performance of the financial markets  particularly the equity markets  and the interest rates used to calculate our pension obligations for funding and expense purposes 
annual pension contributions are determined under government regulations and determined based upon our pension funding status  interest rates  and other factors 
if the financial markets perform poorly  we could be required to make additional large contributions 
the equity markets can be volatile  and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change dramatically in relatively short periods of time 
similarly  changes in interest rates can affect our contribution requirements 
in a low interest rate environment  the likelihood of higher contributions in the future increases 
following the sale of our networks infrastructure assets we will retain certain promissory notes and other obligations relating to vendor financing  but will no longer have a customer vendor relationship with the borrowers  which may put us at increased risk for defaults 
certain of the customers of our networks business who purchase large infrastructure systems request that their suppliers provide financing in connection with equipment purchases 
we will retain any promissory notes or other obligations related to such vendor financing that was consummated up to the closing of the sale of our networks business 
as of december   the outstanding amount was approximately million 
as we will no longer have a customer vendor relationship with the borrowers following the sale we could be at increased risk of a default by such customers  as they may choose to pay their current vendors before they pay us 
in addition  a majority of these customers operate in the middle east and could be negatively impacted by political unrest in this region 
the company s credit rating could impact our ability to access the capital markets 
the company is rated middle triple b by two of the three national rating agencies and low triple b  under review for upgrade  by the third rating agency 
any downward changes by the rating agencies to our credit rating may negatively impact the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities 
under certain circumstances  if our credit ratings are downgraded or other negative action is taken  an increase in the interest rate payable by us under our revolving credit facility could result 
in addition  a downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our ability to access the debt markets  provide performance bonds  bid bonds  standby letters of credit and surety bonds  hedge foreign exchange risk  fund our foreign affiliates  and sell receivables 
a downgrade in our credit rating could also result in less favorable trade terms with suppliers 
in addition  any downgrades in our credit ratings may affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may affect the terms of any such financing 
any future disruptions  uncertainty or volatility in the capital markets may result in higher funding costs for the company and adversely affect our ability to access funds and other credit related products 
our success depends in part on our timely introduction of new products and technologies and our results can be impacted by the effectiveness of our significant investments in new products and technologies 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards 
we face intense competition in these markets and new products are expensive to develop and bring to market 
our success depends  in substantial part  on the timely and successful introduction of new products and upgrades of current products to comply with emerging industry standards and to address competing technological and product developments carried out by our competitors 
the research and development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and investment  as well as the accurate anticipation of technology and market trends 
many of our products and systems are complex and we may experience delays in completing development and introducing new products or technologies in the future 
we may focus our resources on technologies that do not become widely accepted or are not commercially viable 
in addition  our products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after deployment 
if our products are not competitive or do not work properly  our business will suffer 
our results are subject to risks related to our significant investment in developing and introducing new products  such as integrated digital radios and integrated public safety systems 
these risks include i difficulties 
table of contents and delays in the development  production  testing and marketing of products  ii customer acceptance of products  iii the development of  approval of  and compliance with industry standards  iv the significant amount of resources we must devote to the development of new technologies  and v the ability to differentiate our products and compete with other companies in the same markets 
we are exposed to risks under large multi year system contracts that may negatively impact our business 
we enter into large multi year system contracts with large municipal  state and nation wide government customers 
this exposes us to risks  including i the technological risks of such contracts  especially when the contracts involve new technology  and ii financial risks under these contracts  including the estimates inherent in projecting costs associated with large contracts and the related impact on operating results 
we are also facing increasing competition from traditional system integrators and the defense industry as system contracts become larger and more complicated 
political developments also can impact the nature and timing of these large contracts 
in addition  multi year awards from governmental customers may often only receive partial funding initially 
the termination of funding for a government program would result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program  which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 
in addition  we are increasingly being asked by our government customers to provide managed services  which require that we partner with other systems providers  often through the formation of a multi year joint venture  to design  construct  manage and operate a public safety system 
such public private partnerships may require us to assume the risk and agree to specific performance metrics that meet the customer s requirement for network availability  reliability  maintenance and support 
in certain cases if these performance metrics are not met we may not be paid 
depending on the nature of such projects  which are referred to as build own operate boo and in some cases maintain boom or transfer boot  we may be unable to recognize revenue from the sale of equipment for a period of time  which may be several years 
such boo  boom and boot arrangements shift risk to us and may result in an adverse impact on our profitability if we are unable to meet the requirements of such contracts 
a portion of our business is dependent upon us government contracts and grants  which are highly regulated and subject to oversight audits by us government representatives and subject to cancellations 
such audits could result in adverse findings and negatively impact our business 
our government business is subject to specific procurement regulations with numerous compliance requirements 
these requirements  although customary in us government contracting  increase our performance and compliance costs 
these costs may increase in the future  thereby reducing our margins  which could have an adverse effect our on our financial condition 
failure to comply with these regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from us government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time  and the inability to receive future grants 
among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws  including those related to procurement integrity  export control  us government security regulations  employment practices  protection of the environment  accuracy of records  proper recording of costs  and foreign corruption 
generally  us government contracts and grants are subject to oversight audits by us government representatives 
such audits could result in adjustments to our contracts or grants 
any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract or grant may not be allowed  and such costs already reimbursed may have to be refunded 
future audits and adjustments  if required  may materially reduce our revenues or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits 
negative audit findings could also result in investigations  termination of a contract or grant  forfeiture of profits or reimbursements  suspension of payments  fines and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the us government 
all contracts with the us government are subject to cancellation at the convenience of the us government 
we derive a portion of our revenue from government customers who award business through competitive bidding which can involve significant upfront costs and risks 
this effort may not result in awards of business or we may fail to accurately estimate the costs to fulfill contracts awarded to us  which could have adverse consequences on our future profitability 
some government customers award business through a competitive bidding process  which results in greater competition and increased pricing pressure 
the competitive bidding process involves significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids for contracts that may not be awarded to us 
even if we are awarded contracts  we 
table of contents may fail to accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill a contract  which could negatively impact the profitability of any contract award to us 
in addition  following any contract award  we may experience significant expense or delay  contract modification or contract rescission as a result of customer delay or our competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to us in competitive bidding 
government regulation of radio frequencies may limit the growth of public safety broadband systems or reduce barriers to entry for new competitors 
radio frequencies are required to provide wireless services 
the allocation of frequencies is regulated in the us and other countries and limited spectrum space is allocated to wireless services and specifically to public safety users 
the growth of public safety broadband communications systems may be affected i by regulations relating to the access to allocated spectrum for public safety users  ii if adequate frequencies are not allocated  or iii if new technologies are not developed to better utilize the frequencies currently allocated for such use 
industry growth may also be affected by new licenses fees required to use frequencies 
the us leads the world in spectrum deregulation  allowing new wireless communications technologies to be developed and offered for sale 
examples include wireless local area network systems  such as wifi  mesh technologies and wide area network systems  such as wimax and lte 
other countries have also deregulated portions of their available spectrum to allow deployment of these and other technologies 
deregulation may introduce new competition and new opportunities for the company 
the us is currently contemplating allocating the mhz in the mhz spectrum block the so called d block spectrum to public safety 
alternatively the d block spectrum may be auctioned to commercial carriers  as has been advocated by the federal communications commission fcc 
failure to allocate the d block spectrum to public safety could negatively impact our ability to provide next generation public safety communications systems in the us and  as a result  negatively impact our business 
our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world and  as a result  we face risks that other companies that are not global may not face 
our customers and suppliers are located throughout the world and more than of our revenue is generated by customers outside the us in addition  we have a number of manufacturing  research and development  administrative and sales facilities outside the us and more than of our employees are employed outside the us most of our suppliers operations are outside the us and most of our products are manufactured outside the us as with all companies that have sizeable sales and operations outside the us  we are exposed to risks that could negatively impact sales or profitability  including but not limited to i import export regulations  tariffs  trade barriers and trade disputes  customs classifications and certifications  including but not limited to changes in classifications or errors or omissions related to such classifications and certifications  ii changes in us and us rules related to trade  environmental  health and safety  technical standards and consumer protection  iii longer payment cycles  iv tax issues  such as tax law changes  variations in tax laws from country to country and as compared to the us  obligations under tax incentive agreements  difficulties in repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax efficient manner and difficulties in securing local country approvals for cash repatriations  v currency fluctuations  particularly in the chinese renminbi  euro  malaysian ringgit and the british pound  vi foreign exchange regulations  which may limit the company s ability to convert or repatriate foreign currency  vii challenges in collecting accounts receivable  viii cultural and language differences  ix employment regulations and local labor conditions  x difficulties protecting ip in foreign countries  xi instability in economic or political conditions  including inflation  recession and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts  xii natural disasters  xiii public health issues or outbreaks  xiv changes in laws or regulations that negatively impact benefits being received by the company  xv the impact of each of the foregoing on our outsourcing and procurement arrangements  and xvi litigation in foreign court systems and foreign administrative proceedings 
many of our products that are manufactured outside the us are manufactured in asia primarily malaysia and latin america primarily mexico 
if manufacturing in these regions is disrupted  our overall capacity could be significantly reduced and sales or profitability could be negatively impacted 
furthermore  the legal system in china is still developing and this and other legal systems around the world are subject to change 
accordingly  our operations and orders for products in china could be negatively impacted by changes to  or interpretation of  chinese law 

table of contents we also have a presence in emerging markets such as india 
we face additional challenges in emerging markets  including creating demand for our products and the negative impact of changes in the laws  or the interpretation of the laws  in those countries 
we also are subject to risks that our operations outside the us could be conducted by our employees  contractors  representatives or agents in ways that violate the foreign corrupt practices act or other similar anti bribery laws 
while we have policies and procedures to comply with these laws  our employees  contractors  representatives and agents may take actions that violate our policies 
any such violations could have a negative impact on our business 
moreover  we face additional risks that our anti bribery policy and procedures may be violated by third party sales representatives or other agents that help sell our products or provide other services  because such representatives or agents are not our employees and it may be more difficult to oversee their conduct 
changes in our operations or sales outside the us markets could result in lost benefits in impacted countries and increase our cost of doing business 
the company has entered into various agreements with non us governments  agencies or similar organizations under which the company receives certain benefits relating to its operations and or sales in the jurisdiction 
if the company s circumstances change and operations or sales are not at levels originally anticipated  including as a result of obligations undertaken prior to the separation of motorola mobility which cannot be fulfilled  the company may be at risk of having to reimburse benefits already granted  and losing some or all of these benefits and increasing our cost of doing business 
changes in our effective tax rate may have a negative impact on earnings 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign tax jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate may be negatively impacted by changes in the mix of earnings taxable in jurisdictions with different statutory tax rates  changes in tax laws and accounting principles  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  failure to meet commitments under tax incentive agreements  discovery of new information during the course of tax return preparation  increases in nondeductible expenses  or difficulties in repatriating cash held abroad in a tax efficient manner 
tax audits may also negatively impact our effective tax rate 
we are subject to continued examination of our income tax returns  and tax authorities may disagree with our tax positions and assess additional tax 
we regularly evaluate the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these continuing examinations will not have a negative impact on future operating results 
if the quality of our products does not meet our customers expectations  then our sales and operating earnings  and ultimately our reputation  could be negatively impacted 
some of the products we sell may have quality issues resulting from the design or manufacture of the product  or from the software used in the product 
sometimes  these issues may be caused by components we purchase from other manufacturers or suppliers 
often these issues are identified prior to the shipment of the products and may cause delays in shipping products to customers  or even the cancellation of orders by customers 
sometimes  we discover quality issues in the products after they have been shipped to our customers  requiring us to resolve such issues in a timely manner that is the least disruptive to our customers 
such pre shipment and post shipment quality issues can have legal and financial ramifications  including delays in the recognition of revenue  loss of revenue or future orders  customer imposed penalties on us for failure to meet contractual requirements  increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products  and a negative impact on our goodwill and brand name reputation 
in some cases  if the quality issue affects the product s safety or regulatory compliance  then such a defective product may need to be recalled 
depending on the nature of the defect and the number of products in the field  it could cause the company to incur substantial recall costs  in addition to the costs associated with the potential loss of future orders and the damage to the company s goodwill or brand reputation 
in addition  the company may be required  under certain customer contracts  to pay damages for failed performance that might exceed the revenue that the company receives from the contracts 
in certain jurisdictions when contracting with the government no limitation to liability is permitted by law 
recalls involving regulatory agencies could also result in fines and additional costs 
finally  recalls could result in third party litigation by persons alleging harm  resulting from the use of the products 

table of contents many of our components and products are designed or manufactured by third parties and if such third parties lack sufficient quality control or if there are significant changes in the financial or business condition of such third parties  it may have a negative impact on our business 
we rely on third parties to design or manufacture many of our components and finished products 
we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders and our sales and profits could decline if i we are not able to engage such manufacturers with the capabilities or capacities required by our business  ii such third parties lack sufficient quality control and fail to deliver quality components or products on time and at reasonable prices  iii if there are significant changes in the financial or business condition of such third parties 
we utilize the services of subcontractors to perform under many of our contracts and the inability of our subcontractors to perform could cause our products or services to be produced or delivered in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner 
we engage subcontractors on many of our contracts 
we may have disputes with our subcontractors  including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor 
our subcontractors may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials  components  subsystems and services they supply  which might result in greater product returns  service problems and warranty claims and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
failure of our suppliers to use acceptable ethical business practices could negatively impact our business 
it is our policy to require our suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws  rules and regulations regarding working conditions  employment practices  environmental compliance and trademark and copyright licensing 
however  we do not control their labor and other business practices 
if one of our suppliers violates labor or other laws or implements labor or other business practices that are regarded as unethical  the shipment of finished products to us could be interrupted  orders could be canceled  relationships could be terminated and our reputation could be damaged 
if one of our suppliers fails to procure necessary license rights to trademarks  copyrights or patents  legal action could be taken against us that could impact the salability of our inventory and expose us to financial obligations to a third party 
any of these events could have a negative impact on our sales and results of operations 
our success is dependent  in part  upon our ability to form successful strategic alliances 
if these arrangements do not develop as expected  our business may be negatively impacted 
we currently partner with industry leaders and other large organizations to meet customer product and service requirements and to develop innovative advances in design and technology 
some of our partnerships allow us to supplement internal manufacturing capacity and share the cost of developing next generation technologies 
other partnerships allow us to offer more services and features to our customers 
however  such arrangements carry an element of risk because  in many cases  we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a partnership and  at the same time  cooperate with that company in other business areas 
if such arrangements do not develop as expected  our business could be negatively impacted 
we rely on third party distributors  representatives and retailers to sell certain of our products 
in addition to our own sales force  we offer our products through a variety of third party distributors  representatives and retailers 
our distributors or representatives may also market other products that compete with our products 
the loss  termination or failure of one or more of our distributors or representatives to effectively promote our products  or changes in the financial or business condition of these distributors  representatives or retailers  could affect our ability to bring products to market 
our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of materials  parts and components to meet the demands of our customers and any reduction or interruption in supplies or significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our business 
our ability to meet customers demands depends  in part  on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of quality materials  parts and components from our suppliers 
if demand for our products increases from our current expectations  we could experience shortages 
we have experienced shortages in the past that have negatively impacted our operations 
although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid shortages  there can be no assurance that we will not encounter shortages in the future or that such shortages will not negatively impact our operations 

table of contents furthermore  certain of our components are available only from a single source or limited sources 
we may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner 
a reduction or interruption in supplies or a significant increase in the price of supplies could have a negative impact on our business 
in addition  our current contractual arrangements with certain suppliers may be cancelled or not extended by such suppliers and  therefore  not afford the company with sufficient protection against a reduction or interruption in supplies 
moreover  in the event any of these single source or limited source suppliers breach their contracts with us  our legal remedies associated with such a breach may be insufficient to compensate the company for any damages we may suffer 
we face many risks relating to intellectual property rights 
our business will be harmed if i we  our customers and or our suppliers are found to have infringed intellectual property rights of third parties  ii the intellectual property indemnities in our supplier agreements are inadequate to cover damages and losses due to infringement of third party intellectual property rights by supplier products  iii we are required to provide broad intellectual property indemnities to our customers  iv our intellectual property protection is inadequate to protect our proprietary rights  or v our competitors negotiate significantly more favorable terms for licensed intellectual property 
we may be harmed if we are forced to make publicly available  under the relevant open source licenses  certain internally developed software related intellectual property as a result of either our use of open source software code or the use of third party software that contains open source code 
because our products are comprised of complex technology  much of which we acquire from suppliers through the purchase of components or licensing of software  we are often involved in or impacted by assertions  including both requests for licenses and litigation  regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
third parties have asserted  and in the future may assert  intellectual property infringement claims against us and against our customers and suppliers 
these assertions against the company  and its customers and suppliers have been increasing as the complexity of our products have increased 
while many of these claims were directed at our former mobile devices and home businesses  we still retain risk of such claims including with respect to actions filed against us prior to the distribution of motorola mobility which crossed our respective businesses 
many of these assertions are brought by non practicing entities whose principle business model is to secure patent licensing based revenue from product manufacturing companies 
the patentees often make broad and sweeping claims regarding the applicability of their patents to our products  seeking a percentage of sales as licenses fees  seeking injunctions to pressure us into taking a license  or a combination thereof 
defending claims may be expensive and divert the time and efforts of our management and employees 
increasingly  third parties have sought broad injunctive relief which could limit our ability to sell our products in the us or elsewhere with intellectual property subject to the claims 
if we do not succeed in any such litigation  we could be required to expend significant resources to pay damages  develop non infringing intellectual property or to obtain licenses to the intellectual property that is the subject of such litigation  each of which could have a negative impact on our financial results 
however  we cannot be certain that any such licenses  if available at all  will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms 
in some cases  we might be forced to stop delivering certain products if we or our customer or supplier are subject to a final injunction 
we attempt to negotiate favorable intellectual property indemnities with our suppliers for infringement of third party intellectual property rights 
however  there is no assurance that we will be successful in our negotiations or that a supplier s indemnity will cover all damages and losses suffered by us and our customers due to the infringing products or that a supplier will choose to accept a license or modify or replace its products with non infringing products which would otherwise mitigate such damages and losses 
further  the company may not be able to participate in intellectual property litigation involving a supplier and may not be able to influence any ultimate resolution or outcome that may negatively impact our sales if a court enters an injunction that enjoins the supplier s products or if the international trade commission issues an exclusionary order that blocks our products from importation into the us the frequency with which intellectual property disputes involving our suppliers have resulted in our involvement in international trade commission proceedings has increased 
these proceedings are costly and entail the risk that we will be subjected to a ban on the importation of our products into the us solely as a result of our use of a supplier s components 
in addition  our customers increasingly demand that we indemnify them broadly from all damages and losses resulting from intellectual property litigation against them 

table of contents our patent and other intellectual property rights are important competitive tools and may generate income under license agreements 
we regard our intellectual property as proprietary and attempt to protect them with patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secret laws  confidentiality agreements and other methods 
we also generally restrict access to and distribution of our proprietary information 
despite these precautions  it may be possible for a third party to obtain and use our proprietary information or develop similar technology independently 
in addition  effective patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in certain foreign countries 
unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights by third parties and the cost of any litigation necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights could have a negative impact on our business 
as we expand our business  including through acquisitions  and compete with new competitors in new markets  the breadth and strength of our intellectual property portfolio in those new areas may not be as developed as in our longer standing businesses 
this may expose us to a heightened risk of litigation and other challenges from competitors in these new markets 
further  competitors may be able to negotiate significantly more favorable terms for licensed intellectual property than we are able to  which puts them at a competitive advantage 
while the businesses that are a part of motorola solutions have historically experienced lower intellectual property related risks than have other businesses that were transferred with motorola mobility  as the products of motorola solutions become more like the products of those other businesses  through the adoption of industry standard technologies  for instance  the intellectual property related risks experienced by motorola solutions may increase 
we may continue to make strategic acquisitions of other companies or businesses and these acquisitions introduce significant risks and uncertainties  including risks related to integrating the acquired businesses and achieving benefits from the acquisitions 
in order to position ourselves to take advantage of growth opportunities  we have made  and may continue to make  strategic acquisitions that involve significant risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include i the difficulty in integrating newly acquired businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner  ii the challenges in achieving strategic objectives  cost savings and other benefits from acquisitions  iii the risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the technologies acquired do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets  iv the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses  v the risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our operations  vi the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience  vii risks associated with integrating financial reporting and internal control systems  viii difficulties in expanding information technology systems and other business processes to accommodate the acquired businesses  and ix future impairments of goodwill of an acquired business 
acquisition candidates in the industries in which we participate may carry higher relative valuations based on their earnings than we do 
this is particularly evident in software and services businesses 
acquiring a business that has a higher valuation than motorola solutions may be dilutive to our earnings  especially if the acquired business has little or no revenue 
in addition  we may not pursue opportunities that are highly dilutive to near term earnings and have  in the past  foregone certain of these acquisitions 
key employees of acquired businesses may receive substantial value in connection with a transaction in the form of change in control agreements  acceleration of stock options and the lifting of restrictions on other equity based compensation rights 
to retain such employees and integrate the acquired business  we may offer additional retention incentives  but it may still be difficult to retain certain key employees 
we may be required to record additional goodwill or other long lived asset impairment charges  which could result in an additional significant charge to earnings 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually 
factors that may be considered in assessing whether goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in the company s stock price or market capitalization  reduced estimates of future cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry 
no goodwill or long lived assets impairment charges were recorded during or during  the company recorded goodwill impairment charges of billion 
the goodwill impairment charges resulted from lower asset values in the overall market and the impact of the 
table of contents macroenvironment on the company s near term forecasts 
declines in the company s stock price or reductions in the company s future cash flow estimates and future operating results may require the company to record significant additional goodwill or other long lived asset impairment charges in our financial statements in future periods  which could negatively impact our financial results 
it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain the types of engineers and other highly skilled employees that are necessary to remain competitive 
competition for key technical personnel in high technology industries is intense 
we believe that our future success depends in large part on our continued ability to hire  assimilate  retain and leverage the skills of qualified engineers and other highly skilled personnel needed to develop successful new products 
we may not be as successful as our competitors at recruiting  assimilating  retaining and utilizing these highly skilled personnel 
our success depends in part upon our ability to attract  retain and prepare succession plans for senior management and key employees 
the performance of our ceo  senior management and other key employees is critical to our success 
if we are unable to retain talented  highly qualified senior management and other key employees or attract them when needed  it could negatively impact the company 
we rely on the experience of our senior management  who have specific knowledge relating to us and our industry that is difficult to replace and competition for management with experience in the communications industry is intense 
a loss of the ceo  a member of senior management or key employee particularly to a competitor could also place us at a competitive disadvantage 
further  if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our ceo  senior management and other key employees  the company could be negatively impacted 
the unfavorable outcome of any pending or future litigation or administrative action could negatively impact the company 
our financial results could be negatively impacted by unfavorable outcomes to any pending or future litigation or administrative actions  including those related to the foreign corrupt practices act and other anti bribery laws 
see item legal proceedings 
there can be no assurances as to the favorable outcome of any litigation 
in addition  it can be very costly to defend litigation and these costs could negatively impact our financial results 
it is important that we are able to obtain many different types of insurance  and if we are not able to obtain insurance we are forced to retain the risk 
the company has many types of insurance coverage and also self insures for some risks and obligations 
while the cost and availability of most insurance is stable  there are still certain types and levels of insurance that remain difficult to obtain 
natural disasters and certain risks arising from securities claims and public liability are potential self insured events that could negatively impact our financial results 
in addition  while we maintain insurance for certain risks  the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities  and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident  incident or claim 
we are subject to a wide range of product regulatory and safety  consumer  worker safety and environmental laws 
our operations and the products we manufacture and or sell are subject to a wide range of global laws 
compliance with existing or future laws could subject us to future costs or liabilities  impact our production capabilities  constrict our ability to sell  expand or acquire facilities  and generally impact our financial performance 
some of these laws relate to the use  disposal  clean up of  and exposure to certain substances 
in the united states  laws often require parties to fund remedial studies or actions regardless of fault and often times in response to action or omissions that were legal at the time they occurred 
the company continues to incur disposal costs and has ongoing remediation obligations 
changes to us environmental laws or our discovery of additional obligations under these laws could have a negative impact on our financial performance 
laws focused on the energy efficiency of electronic products and accessories  recycling of both electronic products and packaging  reducing or eliminating certain hazardous substances in electronic products  and the transportation of batteries continue to expand significantly 
laws pertaining to accessibility features of electronic products  standardization of connectors and power supplies  the transportation of lithium ion batteries and other aspects are also proliferating 

table of contents these laws impact our products and negatively affects our competitive ability to manufacture and sell products 
we expect these trends to continue 
in addition  we anticipate increased demand to meet voluntary criteria related to reduction or elimination of certain constituents from products  increasing energy efficiency  and providing additional accessibility 
we may be unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components and parts that are free of minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries  which could result in a shortage of such components and parts or reputational damages if we are unable to certify that our products are free of such minerals 
the dodd frank wall street reform and consumer protection act included disclosure requirements regarding the use of conflict minerals mined from the democratic republic of congo and adjoining countries drc and procedures regarding a manufacturer s efforts to prevent the sourcing of such conflict minerals 
while final rules implementing these requirements are not expected from the sec until april  the implementation of these requirements may limit the pool of suppliers who can provide us drc conflict free components and parts  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain products in sufficient quantities that meet the drc conflict free designation as proposed by the requirements 
also  since our supply chain is complex  we may face reputational challenges with our customers  other stockholders and the activist community if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins for the defined conflict metals used in our products 
changes in government policies and laws  funding or economic conditions may negatively impact our financial results 
our results may be affected by changes in trade  monetary and fiscal policies  laws and regulations  or other activities of us and non us governments  agencies and similar organizations 
in particular  the financial results of our government business may be negatively impacted by any decreases in the level of government funding  including availability of grants  for public safety projects 
our results may also be affected by social and economic conditions  which impact our operations  including in emerging markets in asia  india  latin america and eastern europe  and in markets subject to ongoing political hostilities and war  including the middle east 
we rely on complex information technology systems and networks to operate our business 
any significant system or network disruption could have a negative impact on our operations  sales and operating results 
we rely on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of complex information technology systems and networks  some of which are within the company and some are outsourced 
all information technology systems are potentially vulnerable to damage or interruption from a variety of sources  including but not limited to computer viruses  security breach  energy blackouts  natural disasters  terrorism  war and telecommunication failures 
there also may be system or network disruptions if new or upgraded business management systems are defective or are not installed properly 
we have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to system and network disruptions  but a system failure or security breach could negatively impact our operations and financial results 
in addition  we may incur additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches 
our share price has been and may continue to be volatile 
our share price has been volatile due  in part  to generally volatile securities markets  the volatility in the telecommunications and technology companies securities markets in particular and the distribution of motorola mobility 
factors other than our financial results that may affect our share price include  but are not limited to  market expectations of our performance  spending plans of our customers and the level of perceived growth in the industries in which we participate 
we have a large cost overhang resulting from the distribution of motorola mobility and must take additional cost reduction actions 
our ability to complete these actions and the impact of such actions on our business beyond those already taken may be limited by a variety of factors 
the cost reduction actions  in turn  may expose us to additional production risk and have a negative impact on our sales  profitability and ability to attract and retain employees 
the distribution of motorola mobility has resulted in costs that were formerly allocated to motorola mobility being absorbed by motorola solutions 
the majority of the overhang costs have been or are planned to be eliminated from motorola solutions through cost reduction activities 

table of contents the impact of these cost reduction actions on our sales and profitability may be influenced by many factors  including  but not limited to i our ability to successfully complete these ongoing efforts  ii our ability to generate the level of cost savings we expect or that are necessary to enable us to effectively compete  iii delays in implementation of anticipated workforce reductions in highly regulated locations outside the united states  particularly in europe and asia  iv decline in employee morale and the potential inability to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees  and v our ability to retain or recruit key employees 
as part of the distribution of motorola mobility we have consolidated or exited certain facilities and our products are designed and manufactured in fewer facilities than in the past 
while we have business continuity and risk management plans in place in case capacity is significantly reduced or eliminated at a given facility  the reduced number of alternative facilities could cause the duration of any manufacturing disruption to be longer 
as a result  we could have difficulties fulfilling our orders and our sales and profits could decline 
following the distribution of motorola mobility we are a smaller  more focused company and may be more susceptible to market fluctuations  other adverse events  increased costs and less favorable purchasing terms 
as a large company we were able to enjoy certain benefits from operating diversity and purchasing leverage 
following the distribution of motorola mobility we are a smaller company and operate in more focused industries 
as a result there is a risk that we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have otherwise been were we still a part of a larger and more operationally diverse company 
in particular  we are more susceptible to reductions in government and corporate spending as a result of our focus on government and enterprise customers 
we may also experience increased costs and less favorable terms as a result of our inability to continue to leverage the purchasing spend of our former mobile devices and home businesses 
prior to the distribution of motorola mobility we negotiated favorable pricing terms with many of our suppliers  some of which have volume based pricing 
in the future  as we establish new pricing terms  our reduced volume demand could negatively impact future pricing from suppliers 
all of these outcomes may result in our products being more costly to manufacture and less competitive 
although we cannot predict the extent of any such increased costs  it is possible that such costs could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
motorola mobility did not assume any of the liabilities associated with our existing public market debt  any of the us pension liabilities  a majority of our non us pension plans or certain corporate litigation matters and we continue to bear all of the risk for these liabilities following liabilities separation of motorola mobility 
we contributed billion of cash and cash equivalents to capitalize motorola mobility at the time of the separation and have an obligation to fund an additional million  upon receipt of cash distributions as a result of future capital reductions of an overseas subsidiary 
we remain liable for all of our existing public market debt  all of the us pension liabilities  the majority of our us pension liabilities and certain corporate litigation matters and motorola mobility did not provide us with any indemnification for these matters 
although we cannot fully predict the extent of these liabilities  it is possible that they could be significant and could have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
following the distribution of motorola mobility  a larger percentage of our cash and cash equivalents are held outside of the united states and we could be subject to repatriation delays and costs which could reduce our financial flexibility 
a substantial percentage of the cash and cash equivalents that we contributed to motorola mobility were paid in the united states  which reduced the amount of our us cash and cash equivalents and  therefore  increased the percentage of cash and cash equivalents held by the company or its subsidiaries in other countries when compared to the pre separation levels 
while the company regularly repatriates funds with minimal adverse financial impact  repatriation of some of the funds has been and could continue to be subject to delay for local country approvals and could have potential adverse tax consequences 
as a result of having a lower amount of the cash and cash equivalents in the us post the contribution to motorola mobility  our financial flexibility is reduced 

table of contents in connection with the distribution of motorola mobility  motorola mobility indemnified us for certain liabilities and we indemnified motorola mobility for certain liabilities 
this indemnity may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of the liabilities assumed by motorola mobility and motorola mobility may be unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us in the future 
pursuant to the master separation and distribution agreement and certain other agreements with motorola mobility  motorola mobility agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities  and we agreed to indemnify motorola mobility for certain liabilities  in each case for uncapped amounts 
there can be no assurance that the indemnity from motorola mobility will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities  or that motorola mobility will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations 
third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that motorola mobility has agreed to assume 
even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from motorola mobility any amounts for which we are held liable  we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves 
in addition  indemnities that we may be required to provide motorola mobility are not subject to any cap  may be significant and could negatively impact our business 
each of these risks could negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
for more detailed information  see the amended and restated master separation and distribution agreement which was filed as an exhibit to our form q for the third quarter we no longer own certain logos and other trademarks  trade names and service marks  including motorola  moto  motorola solutions and the stylized m logo and all derivatives and formatives thereof motorola marks and we license the motorola marks from motorola mobility 
our joint use of the motorola marks could result in product and market confusion and negatively impact our ability to expand our business under the motorola brand 
in addition  if we do not comply with the terms of the license agreement we could lose our rights to the motorola marks 
we have a worldwide  perpetual and royalty free license from motorola mobility to use the motorola marks as part of our corporate name and in connection with the manufacture  sale  and marketing of our current products and services 
the license of the motorola marks is important to us because of the reputation of the motorola brand for our products and services 
although we will continue to be able to use the motorola marks in certain fields of use we no longer own the motorola marks after the distribution of motorola mobility 
there are risks associated with both motorola mobility and the company using the motorola marks and with this loss of ownership 
because both motorola mobility and the company will be using the motorola marks  confusion could arise in the market  including customer and investor confusion regarding the products offered by and the actions of the two companies 
this risk could increase as both motorola mobility s and our products continue to converge 
also  any negative publicity associated with either company in the future could adversely affect the public image of the other 
in addition because our license of the motorola marks will be limited to products and services within our specified fields of use  we will not be permitted to use the motorola marks in other fields of use without the approval of motorola mobility 
in the event that we desire to expand our business into any other fields of use  we may need to do so with a brand other than motorola 
developing a brand as well known and with as much brand equity as motorola could take considerable time and expense 
the risk of needing to develop a second brand increases as motorola mobility s and our products continue to converge and as our business expands into other fields of use 
in addition  we could lose our rights to use the motorola marks if we do not comply with the terms of the license agreement 
such a loss could negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  motorola mobility has the right to license the brand to third parties and either motorola mobility or licensed third parties may use the brand in ways that make the brand less attractive for customers of motorola solutions  creating increased risk that motorola solutions may need to develop an alternate or additional brand 
a change of control of or bankruptcy of motorola mobility could result in an incompatible third party owning the motorola marks or the loss of certain rights  including the license 
since motorola mobility owns the motorola marks  in the event motorola mobility is acquired  the acquiring entity would gain control of the motorola marks 
similarly  in the event of a liquidation of motorola mobility it is possible that a bankruptcy court would permit the motorola marks to be assigned to a third party 
while our right to use the motorola marks under our license should continue in our specified field of use in such situations  it is possible that we could be party to a license arrangement with a third party whose interests are incompatible with ours  thereby potentially making the license arrangement difficult to administer  and increasing the costs and risks 
table of contents associated with sharing the motorola marks 
in addition  there is a risk that  in the event of a bankruptcy of motorola mobility  motorola mobility or its bankruptcy trustee may attempt to reject the license  or a bankruptcy court may refuse to uphold the license or certain of its terms 
such a loss could negatively affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we contributed a significant portfolio of intellectual property rights  including patents  to motorola mobility and we are unable to leverage these intellectual property rights as we did prior to the distribution of motorola mobility 
we contributed approximately  granted patents and approximately  pending patent applications worldwide to motorola mobility in connection with the distribution 
although we will have a perpetual  royalty free license to these patents and other intellectual property rights  we no longer own them 
as a result we will be unable to leverage these intellectual property rights for purposes of generating licensing revenue or entering into favorable licensing arrangements with third parties 
as a result we may incur increased license fees or litigation costs 
although we cannot predict the extent of such unanticipated costs  it is possible such costs could negatively impact our financial results 
these risks will increase if we are unable to complete the sale of our networks business 
some contracts which were assigned from us or our affiliates to motorola mobility or its affiliates in connection with the separation require the consent or involvement of the counterparty to such an assignment  many of which have not yet been obtained 
failure to obtain consents with or a termination of the agreement by any of our large customers or suppliers  or interference by such customers or suppliers with such an assignment  could negatively impact our financial condition and future results of operations 
the master separation and distribution agreement and various local transfer agreements provide that in connection with the separation of motorola mobility from us  a number of contracts with customers  suppliers  landlords and other third parties were assigned from us or our affiliates to motorola mobility or motorola mobility s affiliates 
however  some of these contracts require the contractual counterparty s consent to such an assignment 
similarly  in some circumstances  our former mobile devices and or home business and another of our business units were joint beneficiaries of contracts  and motorola mobility or we will need to enter into a new agreement with the third party to replicate the contract or assign the portion of the contract related to our respective businesses 
because of the volume of agreements which require consent to assign  replicate or replace  this process will not be completed for some time 
it is possible that some parties may use the requirement of a consent to seek more favorable contractual terms from us or seek to terminate the contract 
if we are unable to complete the assignments in a timely manner  we may remain primarily liable for contracts that should have been assigned to motorola mobility  may be required to enter into new agreements at significantly less favorable terms or may find our contracts terminated 
the failure to complete the assignment of existing contracts  or the negotiation of new agreements  with any of our large customers or key suppliers including those that are single source or limited source suppliers  or a termination of any of those arrangements  could negatively impact our financial condition and future results of operations 
completion of the distribution of motorola mobility may not enhance long term shareholder value 
we completed the distribution of motorola mobility on january  at the time of this distribution  our board and management team  after consultation with independent financial and legal advisors  believed that the distribution of motorola mobility as planned would enhance long term shareholder value 
there can be no assurance  however  that the combined value of our common stock and the common stock of motorola mobility will equal or exceed what the value of our common stock would have been in the absence of the distribution in the long term 
the combined value of the common stock of the two companies following the distribution could be lower than anticipated for a variety of reasons  including  among others  the inability of motorola mobility to compete effectively as an independent company  realignment of the stockholder population of both the company and motorola mobility in the period following the distribution  and changes in market perception of the prospects of the company and motorola mobility as a consequence of the distribution
