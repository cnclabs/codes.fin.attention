executive level overview trimble s focus is on combining positioning technology with wireless communication and application capabilities to create system level solutions that enhance productivity and accuracy for our customers 
the majority of our markets are end user markets  including engineering and construction firms  governmental organizations  public safety workers  farmers  and companies who must manage fleets of mobile workers and assets 
we also provide components to original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their products 
in the end user markets  we provide a system that includes a hardware platform that may contain software and customer support 
some examples of our solutions include products that automate and simplify the process of surveying land  products that automate the utilization of equipment such as tractors and bulldozers  products that enable a company to manage its mobile workforce and assets  and products that allow municipalities to manage their fixed assets 
in addition  we also provide software applications on a stand alone basis 
for example  we provide software for project management on construction sites 
to achieve distribution  marketing  production  and technology advantages in our targeted markets  we manage our operations in the following four segments engineering and construction  field solutions  mobile solutions  and advanced devices 
solutions targeted at the end user make up a significant majority of our revenue 
to create compelling products  we must attain an understanding of the end users needs and work flow  and how location based technology can enable that end user to work faster  more efficiently  and more accurately 
we use this knowledge to create highly innovative products that change the way work is done by the end user 
with the exception of our mobile solutions and advanced devices segments  our products are generally sold through a dealer channel  and it is crucial that we maintain a proficient  global  third party distribution channel 
we continued to execute our strategy with a series of actions that can be summarized in three categories 
reinforcing our position in existing markets we believe these markets continue to be underpenetrated and provide us with additional  substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods 
we are continuing to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels in order to expand our market 
in our engineering and construction segment  we introduced new and enhanced systems for our optical total station portfolio that provide better accuracy and improve surveyor productivity 
we also introduced the new trimble tunnel construction solution which streamlines the precision construction of road and railway tunnels 
we released the new generation of gps pathfinder proxrt receiver which provides decimeter accuracy and includes support for omnistar  glonass  and galileo with trimble receiver technology

during the year  we also acquired cengea solutions which is a provider of spatially enabled business operations and supply chain management software for the forestry  agriculture and natural resource industries 
this acquisition allows us to provide productivity solutions that transform operations across the continuum of forest management activities 
in our advanced devices segment  the acquisition of thingmagic s radio frequency identification  or rfid  technology and system integration expertise will allow us to build more comprehensive and offer advanced development services to facilitate the integration of rfid into a wide range of applications 
bringing existing technology to new markets we continue to reinforce our position in existing markets and position ourselves in newer markets that will serve as important sources of future growth 
our efforts are focused in africa  china  india  the middle east and russia 
during the year  we formed a joint venture in russia with russian space systems which will be responsible for selling commercial gnss geodetic network infrastructure systems localized for russia and the commonwealth of independent states  or cis 
in addition  we continue our expansion of sitech dealerships 
during  new sitech locations were established in china  india  brazil  mexico  russia  indonesia  the czech republic  and the philippines  among other locations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition we elected to early adopt new revenue accounting guidance related to arrangements with multiple deliverables at the beginning of our first quarter of fiscal on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified after january  we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
contracts and or customer purchase orders are used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analyses  as well as the customer s payment history 

table of contents revenue for orders is generally not recognized until the product is shipped and title has transferred to the buyer 
we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point 
our shipment terms for us orders and international orders fulfilled from our european distribution center typically provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point 
if no precise point is indicated by the buyer  we may choose within the place or range stipulated where the carrier will take the goods into carrier s charge 
other shipment terms may provide that title passes to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the buyer 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
revenue from sales to distributors and resellers is recognized upon shipment  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
distributors and resellers do not typically have a right of return 
revenue from purchased extended warranty and post contract support pcs agreements is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty or support period 
we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 
our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and pcs 
we generally have established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate 
the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method 
license revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and fair value has been established for all remaining undelivered elements 
our multiple deliverable product offerings include hardware with embedded firmware  extended warranty and pcs services  which are considered separate units of accounting 
for certain of our products  software and non software components function together to deliver the tangible product s essential functionality 
some of our subscription product offerings include hardware  subscription services and extended warranty 
under our hosted arrangements  the customer typically does not have the contractual right to take possession of the software at any time during the hosting period without incurring a significant penalty and it is not feasible for the customer to run the software either on its own hardware or on a third party s hardware 
upfront fees related to our hosted solutions typically consist of amounts for the in vehicle enabling hardware device and peripherals 
in evaluating the revenue recognition for agreements which contain multiple deliverable arrangements  under the new accounting guidance  we determined that in certain instances we were not able to establish vsoe for some or all deliverables in an arrangement as we infrequently sold each element on a standalone basis  did not price products within a narrow range  or had a limited sales history 
when vsoe cannot be established  we attempt to establish the selling price of each element based on relevant third party evidence tpe 
tpe is determined based on competitor prices for similar deliverables when sold separately 
generally  our go to market strategy differs from that of competitors  and offerings may contain a significant level of proprietary technology  customization or differentiation such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained 
furthermore  we are unable to reliably determine what similar competitor products selling prices are on a stand alone basis 
therefore  we typically are not able to establish the selling price of an element based on tpe 
when we are unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  we use our best estimate of selling price besp in our allocation of arrangement consideration 
the objective of besp is to determine the price at which we would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
besp is generally used for offerings that are not typically sold on a stand alone basis or for new or highly customized offerings 
we determine besp for a product or service by considering multiple factors including  but not limited to  pricing practices  market conditions  competitive landscape  internal costs  geographies and gross margin 
the determination of besp is made through consultation with and formal approval by our management  taking into consideration our go to market strategy 
total revenue as reported and pro forma total revenues that would have been reported for the fiscal year ended december   if the transactions entered into after january  were subject to previous accounting guidance  are shown in the following table dollars in thousands as reported pro forma total revenue for the fiscal year ended december  the impact of the revised accounting guidance to total revenue during the fiscal year ended december  was attributable to the reallocation of discounts to revenue deliverables  the recognition of hardware revenue 
table of contents associated with subscription contracts upon delivery  which was previously recognized ratably over the contract period  and the ability to assign selling price to undelivered elements  which previously required vsoe 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns reserve  was million as of december   as compared with million as of january  the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million as of december  and january   respectively 
we evaluate ongoing collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances  credit quality  historical experience  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates experienced in the ordinary course of business 
the reserve for sales returns as of december  and january  was million and million  respectively  for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our revenue could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation our inventories  net balance was million as of december  as compared with million as of january  our inventory allowances as of december  were million  as compared with million as of january  our inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  are made for estimated excess  obsolescence  or impaired balances 
factors influencing these adjustments include decline in demand  technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration  and quality issues 
if actual factors are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 
relative to uncertain tax positions  we only recognize the tax benefit if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
our practice is to recognize interest and or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense 
our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to acquired net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards 
management believes that it is more likely than not that we will not realize these deferred tax assets  and  accordingly  a valuation allowance has been provided for such amounts 
beginning in  we adopted the revised accounting guidance for business combinations  under which such valuation allowance adjustments associated with an acquisition closing after january  and after the measurement period are recorded through income tax expense 
prior to january   these adjustments were required to be recognized by adjusting the purchase price related to the acquisition 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
beginning in fiscal  our identifiable intangible assets now include in process research and development based on the revised accounting guidance for business combinations 
intangible assets acquired individually  with a group of other assets  or in a business combination  are recorded at fair value 
identifiable intangible assets are comprised of distribution channels and distribution rights  patents  licenses  technology  acquired backlog  trademarks  and in process research and development 
identifiable intangible assets are being amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight line method  reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets  and have estimated 
table of contents useful lives ranging from one to ten years with a weighted average useful life of years 
goodwill is not subject to amortization  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment  applying a fair value based test 
impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we evaluate goodwill  at a minimum  on an annual basis and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment utilizing a two step process 
first  impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill  to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair values of the reporting units are estimated using a discounted cash flow approach 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  a second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
in step two  the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated as the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the fair values assigned to its assets and liabilities 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the difference is recognized as an impairment loss 
as of december   for each reporting unit  our estimated fair values exceeded the carry values by substantial margins 
depreciation and amortization of the intangible assets and other long lived assets is provided using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  reflecting the pattern of economic benefits associated with these assets 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model  or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives of intangible assets or other long lived assets differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of an asset should be revised  the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value will be expensed and the residual value is depreciated over its revised remaining useful life 
these assets are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
the assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value 
warranty costs the liability for product warranties was million as of december   as compared with million as of january  we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs  technical support labor costs  and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf 
our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
the products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from days to three years  and in some instances  up to years 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 
stock based compensation we recognize compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
stock based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of income for fiscal  and includes compensation expense for stock options granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december  the grant date fair value of these options was estimated using the black scholes options pricing model 
the grant date fair value for options granted subsequent to december  is estimated using a binomial valuation model 
the fair value of rights to purchase shares under stock participation plans is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rates  and expected dividends 
in addition  the binomial model incorporates actual option pricing behavior and changes in volatility over the option s contractual term 

table of contents beginning in fiscal  our expected stock price volatility for stock purchase rights has been based on implied volatilities of traded options on our stock and our expected stock price volatility for stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock price volatility for the period commensurate with the expected life of the stock option and the implied volatility of traded options 
the use of implied volatilities was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our stock with terms similar to our awards and also upon our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
however  because the expected life of our stock options is greater than the terms of our traded options  we used a combination of our historical stock price volatility commensurate with the expected life of our stock options and implied volatility of traded options 
we estimated the expected life of the awards based on an analysis of our historical experience of employee exercise and post vesting termination behavior considered in relation to the contractual life of the options and purchase rights 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the expected term of the awards 
we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  our expected dividend yield is zero 
because stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income for fiscal  and is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the stock based compensation guidance requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions to determine the fair value of our share based payment awards granted in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under it may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
in addition  valuation models  including the black scholes and binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination  or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements

we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 
no single customer accounted for or more of our total revenue in fiscal  and it is possible  however  that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 
gross margin our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix  pricing  distribution channel used  effects of production volumes  new product start up costs  and foreign currency translations 
in fiscal  our gross margin increased by million as compared to fiscal primarily due to higher revenue 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to improved product mix in engineering and construction and field solutions  partially offset by the loss of a large  high margin customer in mobile solutions 
in fiscal  our gross margin decreased by million as compared to fiscal primarily due to lower revenue 
gross margin as a percentage of total revenue was both in fiscal and fiscal the consistency in the gross margin percentage was primarily due to manufacturing cost reductions in engineering and construction and improved product mix in field solutions  offset by lower revenue as a percentage of fixed costs 
because of potential product mix changes within and among the industry markets  market pressures on unit selling prices  fluctuations in unit manufacturing costs  including increases in component prices and other factors  current level gross margin cannot be assured 
operating income operating income increased by million for fiscal as compared to fiscal operating income as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal was as compared to for fiscal the increase in operating income was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated gross margin

restructuring 
included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses  restructuring costs recorded are primarily for employee compensation resulting from reductions in employee headcount in connection with our company restructurings

we exclude these expenses from our non gaap measures because we believe they are not indicative of our core operating performance 
c 
stock based compensation 
included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales and operating expenses  stock based compensation consists of expenses for employee stock options and awards and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan

amortization of acquisition related inventory step up 
the purchase accounting entries associated with our business acquisitions require us to record inventory at its fair value  which is sometimes greater than the previous book value of the inventory 
included in our gaap presentation of cost of sales  the increase in inventory value is amortized to cost of sales over the period that the related product is sold 
we exclude inventory step up amortization from our non gaap measures because we do not believe it is indicative of our core operating performance 
e 
non recurring acquisition costs 
included in our gaap presentation of operating expenses and non operating income  net  non recurring acquisition costs consist of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition activities such as legal  due diligence and integration costs 
also included are unusual acquisition related items such as a gain on bargain purchase resulting from the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired exceeding the consideration transferred  adjustments to the fair value of earnout liabilities and payments made or received to settle earnout and holdback disputes

stock based compensation 
the amounts consist of expenses for employee stock options and awards and purchase rights under our employee stock purchase plan 
as referred to above we exclude stock based compensation here because investors may view it as not reflective of our core operating performance 
however  management does include stock based compensation for budgeting and incentive plans as well as for reviewing internal financial reporting 
we discuss our operating results by segment with and without stock based compensation expense  as we believe it is useful to investors

non gaap operating income non gaap operating income increased by million for fiscal as compared to fiscal  and decreased by million for fiscal as compared to fiscal non gaap operating income as a percentage of total revenue was   and for fiscal years   and  respectively 
the increase in operating income and operating income percentage during fiscal was primarily driven by higher revenue and associated operating leverage in the engineering and construction and field solutions  partially offset by mobile solutions 
the decrease in operating income and operating income percentage during fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to a decrease in engineering and construction revenue and operating leverage 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
all financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors 
market interest rate risk our cash equivalents consisted primarily of money market funds  treasury bills  commercial paper fdic insured  interest and non interest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits for fiscal the main objective of these instruments was safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return  without significantly increasing risk 
due to the short term nature of our cash equivalents  we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates 
we are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our senior secured credit facilities 
our credit facility is comprised of an unsecured revolving credit agreement with a maturity date of february we may borrow funds under the revolving credit agreement in us dollars or in certain other currencies and borrowings will bear interest as described under note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december   we had an outstanding balance on the revolving credit line of million 
a hypothetical increase in the three month libor rates could result in approximately  annual increase in interest expense on the existing principal balances 
the hypothetical changes and assumptions made above will be different from what actually occurs in the future 
furthermore  the computations do not anticipate actions that may be taken by our management should the hypothetical market changes actually occur over time 
as a result  actual earnings effects in the future will differ from those quantified above 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on cash  certain trade and inter company receivables and payables  primarily denominated in australian  canadian and new zealand dollars  japanese yen  indian rupee  south african rand  swedish krona  euro  and british pound 
these contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in exchange rate movements as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts 
these instruments are marked to market through earnings every period and generally range from one to three months in original maturity 
we do not enter into foreign exchange forward contracts for trading purposes 
foreign exchange forward contracts outstanding as of december  and january  are summarized as follows in thousands december  january  nominal amount fair value nominal amount fair value forward contracts purchased sold we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position utilizing our current hedging strategy
