item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section entitled selected financial data in this report and our consolidated financial statements and related notes to this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully discussed in item a of this report  entitled risk factors 
overview we are a leader in the research  development and commercialization of organic light emitting diode  or oled  technologies for use in flat panel display  solid state lighting and other applications 
since  we have been exclusively engaged  and expect to continue to be exclusively engaged  in funding and performing research and development activities relating to oled technologies and materials  and in attempting to commercialize these technologies and materials 
our revenues are generated through contract research  sales of development and commercial chemicals  license fees and royalties  technology development and evaluation agreements  and commercialization assistance agreements 
in the future  we anticipate that the revenues from licensing our intellectual property will become a more significant part of our revenue stream 
while we have made significant progress over the past few years developing and commercializing our family of oled technologies pholed  toled  foled  etc 
and materials  we have incurred significant losses and will likely continue to do so until our oled technologies and materials become more widely adopted by product manufacturers 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december  we anticipate fluctuations in our annual and quarterly results of operations due to uncertainty regarding the timing of our receipt of license fees and royalties  as well as fees for future technology development and evaluation  the timing and volume of sales of our oled materials for both commercial usage and evaluation purposes  the timing and magnitude of expenditures we may incur in connection with our ongoing research and development activities  and the timing and financial consequences of our formation of new business relationships and alliances 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from our estimates under other assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our accounting policies related to revenue recognition and deferred license fees  stock based compensation and accounting for warrants and our supplemental executive retirement plan  as described below  are our critical accounting policies as contemplated by the sec 
these policies  which have been reviewed with our audit committee  are discussed in greater detail below 
revenue recognition and deferred license fees contract research revenue represents reimbursements by the us government for all or a portion of the research and development expenses we incur related to our government contracts 
revenue is recognized proportionally as research and development expenses are incurred or as defined milestones are achieved 
in order to ascertain the revenue associated with these contracts for a period  we estimate the proportion of related research and development expenses incurred and whether defined milestones have been achieved 
different estimates would result in different revenues for the period 
we receive non refundable cash payments under certain development and technology evaluation agreements with our customers 
these payments are generally recognized as revenue over the term of the agreement 
on occasion  however  these payments are creditable against license fees and or royalties payable by the customer if a license agreement is subsequently executed with the customer 
these payments are classified as deferred license fees or deferred revenues  and are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet until such time as revenue can be recognized 
revenue is deferred until a license agreement is executed or negotiations have ceased and there is no appreciable likelihood of executing a license agreement with the customer 
if a license agreement is executed  these payments are recorded as revenue over the estimated useful life of the licensed technology and the revenue is classified based on the terms of the license 
otherwise  these payments are recorded as revenue at the time negotiations with the customer show that there is no appreciable likelihood of executing a license agreement 
if we used different estimates for the useful life of the licensed technology  reported revenue during the relevant period would differ 
as of december    was recorded as deferred license fees and deferred revenue  of which  may be recognized under license agreements that have not yet been executed or deemed effective 
valuation of stock based compensation we recognize in the statement of operations the grant date fair value of equity based compensation issued to employees and directors see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we also record an expense for equity based compensation grants to non employees  in exchange for goods or services  based on the fair value  which is remeasured over the vesting period of such awards 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options and warrants we have granted for purposes of recording charges to the statement of operations 
in order to calculate the fair value of the options and warrants  assumptions are made for certain components of the model  including expected volatility  expected dividend yield rate and expected option life 
although we use our best estimates when setting these assumptions  changes to the assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the valuation of future grants or the remeasurement of non employee awards 
accounting for warrants on january   we adopted certain revised provisions of accounting standards codification asc  derivatives and hedging 
these provisions apply to freestanding financial instruments or embedded features that have the characteristics of a derivative and to freestanding financial instruments that are potentially settled in an entity s own common stock 
as a result  certain of our warrants are considered to be derivatives since they contain down round provisions and must be remeasured at fair value at the end of each period as they are recorded as liabilities 
the stock warrant liability was  at december  the fair value of the stock warrant liability is determined using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for certain components of the model  including expected volatility and expected annual dividend yield 
although we use our best estimates when setting these assumptions  changes in assumptions could cause significant adjustments to the future valuation of the stock warrant liability 
the change in fair value of the stock warrant liability is recorded as a gain or loss on the statement of operations 
retirement plan we have recorded a significant retirement plan benefit liability that is developed from actuarial valuations 
the determination of our retirement plan benefit liability requires key assumptions regarding discount rates  as well as rates of compensation increases  retirement dates and life expectancies used to determine the present value of future benefit payments 
we determine these assumptions in consultation with  and after input from  our actuaries and considering our experience and expectations for the future 
actual results for a given period will often differ from assumed amounts because of economic and other factors 
the discount rate reflects the estimated rate at which the benefit liabilities could be settled at the end of the year 
the discount rate is determined by selecting a single rate that produces a result equivalent to discounting expected benefit payments from the plan using the citigroup above median pension discount curve curve 
based upon this analysis using the curve  we used a discount rate to measure our retirement plan benefit liability of at december  a change of basis points in the discount rate would increase or decrease the expense on an annual basis by approximately  results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had an operating loss of  for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of  for the decrease in operating loss was due to an increase in revenue of  offset by an increase in operating expenses of  we had a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for the decrease in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in operating loss of  offset by an increase in loss on stock warrant liability of  our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for commercial revenue increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for commercial revenue relates to the incorporation of our oled technologies and materials into our customers commercial products  and includes commercial chemical revenue  royalty and license revenues  and commercialization assistance revenue 
the increase in commercial revenue was primarily due to the following an increase of  in commercial chemical revenue  and an increase of  in royalty revenue  which mainly represented royalties received under our patent license agreement with samsung smd 
we cannot accurately predict how long our material sales to samsung smd or other customers will continue  as they frequently update and alter their product offerings in response to market demands 
continued sales of our oled materials to these customers will depend on several factors  including pricing  availability  continued technical improvement and competitive product offerings 
in  we entered into three amendments to our patent license agreement with samsung smd 
these amendments extended the term of that agreement for three month periods  the latest extension being through march  as of the date of the filing  we are continuing to negotiate with samsung smd on the terms of a new business arrangement 
we filed for and were granted a five year exemption on withholding tax on royalty payments received from samsung smd under our patent license agreement as part of a tax incentive program in korea 
the exemption was granted in may and remained in effect until may since then  samsung smd has been required to withhold tax upon payment of royalties to us 
in  the withholding tax rate for royalty payments made by samsung smd was 
developmental revenue increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for developmental revenue relates to oled technology and material development and evaluation activities for which we are paid  and includes contract research revenue  development chemical revenue and technology development revenue 
the increase in developmental revenue was primarily due to an increase of  in development chemical revenue  largely due to increased purchases of development chemicals by lg display and other customers preparing for commercial oled production 
cost of chemicals sold increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december   based on the aforementioned increase in chemical sales 
we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase in research and development expenses was consistent with our expectations based on the growth of our business 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was mainly due to increased employee costs of  due primarily to increased salaries and stock compensation for certain executive officers  and expenses of  related to net periodic benefit costs of the universal display corporation supplemental executive retirement plan serp for certain executive officers  which was implemented in see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
patent costs increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase is mainly due to the timing of prosecution and maintenance costs associated with a number of patents and patent applications  as well as the timing of costs for certain ongoing and new patent matters 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the decrease was mainly attributable to decreased rates of return on investments during  compared to rates of return during due to current market conditions  we anticipate that these lower rates of return will continue for the foreseeable future 
at december   we had outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  which warrants contain a down round provision requiring liability classification 
the change in fair value of these warrants during the period resulted in a  non cash loss on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  compared to a  non cash loss for the year ended december  we will continue to report the warrants as a liability  with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations  until such time as these warrants are either exercised or expire in august during the year ended december   we sold approximately million of our state related income tax net operating losses nols and  of our research and development tax credits under the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program 
we received proceeds of  from our sale of these nols and research and development tax credits  and we recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit 
in past years  we completed our sales of state related tax nols during the fourth quarter of the year 
the income tax benefit was offset by foreign income taxes of  withheld in connection with our royalty revenues 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we had an operating loss of  for the year ended december   compared to an operating loss of  for the decrease in operating loss was primarily due to an increase in revenue of  offset by an increase in operating expenses of  we had a net loss of  or per diluted share for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of  or per diluted share for the increase in net loss was primarily due to a decrease in interest income of  a loss on stock warrant liability of  and a decrease in income tax benefit of  offset by a decrease in operating loss of  our revenues were  for the year ended december   compared to  for commercial revenue increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for commercial revenue relates to the incorporation of our oled technologies and materials into our customers commercial products  and includes commercial chemical revenue  royalty and license revenues  and commercialization assistance revenue 
the increase in commercial revenue was due to the following an increase of  in royalty revenue  which mainly represented royalties received under our patent license agreement with samsung smd  an increase of  for commercialization assistance under a business agreement executed in the fourth quarter of  and an increase of  in license fees  primarily due to a patent license agreement we entered into with konica minolta in august  a joint development agreement we previously entered into with a subsidiary of konica minolta  and two other agreements we entered into during the fourth quarter of the overall increase in commercial revenue was offset by a decrease of  in commercial chemical revenue 
the decrease resulted from a lower volume of oled material sales to samsung smd 
our understanding is that this lower sales volume was due to samsung smd s implementation of manufacturing process efficiencies  improved materials utilization and more efficient and improved device structures  offset in part by increased production volume 
we cannot accurately predict how long our material sales to samsung smd or other customers will continue  as they frequently update and alter their product offerings in response to market demands 
continued sales of our oled materials to these customers will depend on several factors  including pricing  availability  continued technical improvement and competitive product offerings 
developmental revenue increased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for developmental revenue relates to oled technology and material development and evaluation activities for which we are paid  and includes contract research revenue  development chemical revenue and technology development revenue 
the increase in developmental revenue was mainly due to the following an increase of  in technology development revenue  primarily due to revenue recognition of a non refundable payment of  that we received from kyocera corporation kyocera during the third quarter of  a increase of  in contract research revenue  principally to the timing of work performed and costs incurred in connection with several new and completed government contracts during  as well as an overall increase in value of our government contracts  and an increase of  in development chemical revenue  mainly due to increased purchases of development chemicals by lg display 
the  payment from kyocera referenced above was for technical assistance previously provided under an evaluation agreement with a subsidiary of kyocera established by it to conduct oled research  development  manufacturing and sales activities 
we had previously classified this payment as deferred revenue because it was creditable against a portion of the upfront fee under our license agreement with kyocera 
the license agreement was to become effective upon notice from kyocera given on or before december  in september  we received notification from kyocera that it was terminating the evaluation agreement because its oled subsidiary was being dissolved on september  based on this notification  we determined and confirmed that kyocera would not be sending us a notice declaring the license agreement effective 
as a result of this development  we recorded the  payment as technology development revenue in the third quarter of we incurred research and development expenses of  for the year ended december   compared to  for the increase was mainly due to increased costs of  incurred under our agreement with ppg industries  increased costs of  associated with subcontractors and consultants under our government contracts  increased employee costs of  and increased costs of  incurred in connection with stock compensation to members of our scientific advisory board 
the increase in research and development expenses was offset by an overall decrease of  in operating costs associated with our ewing facility 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for selling  general and administrative expenses remained relatively consistent over these corresponding periods 
interest income decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the decrease was mainly attributable to decreased rates of return on investments during  compared to rates of return during  as well as a decrease in the amount of cash available for investment 
due to current market conditions  we anticipate that these lower rates of return will continue for the foreseeable future 
at january   we had outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  which warrants contain a down round provision 
on january   the fair value of these warrants of  was reclassified from equity to a liability upon the adoption of certain revisions to asc the change in fair value of these warrants during resulted in a  non cash loss on our statement of operations for the year ended december  we will continue to report the warrants as a liability  with changes in fair value recorded in the statement of operations  until such time as these warrants are either exercised or expire in august during  we received federal cash refunds of  related to research and development credits 
we also received state cash refunds of  from claims for overpaid new jersey alternative minimum assessment tax for taxable years to during  we sold approximately million of our state related income tax net operating losses nols under the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program 
in  we received proceeds of  from our sale of these nols and research and development tax credits  and we recorded these proceeds as an income tax benefit 
no such proceeds were received during  however  we received  in early for the sale of million of our state related nols and  of our research and development tax credits under the program 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  for a total of  this compares to cash and cash equivalents of  and short term investments of  for a total of  as of december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of  was primarily due to the receipt of proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants  offset by cash used in operations 
cash used in operating activities was  for  compared to  for the decreased usage of cash in operating activities was mainly due to the following a decrease in net loss after excluding the impact of non cash items of  and the impact of the timing of payment of accounts payable and accrued expenses of  offset by the impact of the timing of receipt of accounts receivable of cash provided by financing activities was  for  compared to  for the same period in for the year ended december   we received proceeds of  from the exercise of options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and  in proceeds related to our employee stock purchase plan espp  compared to proceeds of  from the exercise of options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and  in proceeds related to our espp for the same period in working capital was  as of december   which included a stock warrant liability of  compared to  as of december  the stock warrant liability will either expire or be exercised by august  resulting in no cash outlay on our part 
working capital  excluding the stock warrant liability  was  as of december  the increase in working capital as of december   compared to december   excluding the stock warrant liability  was mainly due to increased cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  an increase in accounts receivable  and a reduction of the current portion of deferred license fees and deferred revenues 
we anticipate  based on our internal forecasts and assumptions relating to our operations including  among others  assumptions regarding our working capital requirements  the progress of our research and development efforts  the availability of sources of funding for our research and development work  and the timing and costs associated with the preparation  filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of our patents and patent applications  that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents and short term investments to meet our obligations for at least the next months 
we believe that potential additional financing sources for us include long term and short term borrowings  public and private sales of our equity and debt securities and the receipt of cash upon the exercise of warrants and options 
it should be noted  however  that additional funding may be required in the future for research  development and commercialization of our oled technologies and materials  to obtain  maintain and enforce patents respecting these technologies and materials  and for working capital and other purposes  the timing and amount of which are difficult to ascertain 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available to us when needed  on commercially reasonable terms or at all  particularly in the current economic environment 
contractual obligations as of december   we had the following contractual commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years estimated retirement plan benefit payments sponsored research obligation minimum royalty obligation  year total under the license agreement  we are obligated to pay princeton minimum royalties of  per year until such time as the agreement is no longer in effect 
the agreement has no scheduled expiration date 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of obligations upon termination of employment of executive officers as a result of a change in control of the company 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements in the nature of guarantee contracts  retained or contingent interests in assets transferred to unconsolidated entities or similar arrangements serving as credit  liquidity or market risk support to unconsolidated entities for any such assets  or obligations including contingent obligations arising out of variable interests in unconsolidated entities providing financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to us  or that engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services with us 
recently issued accounting pronouncements recently issued accounting pronouncements are addressed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not utilize financial instruments for trading purposes and hold no derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments that could expose us to significant market risk other than our short term investments and our stock warrant liability disclosed in fair value measurements in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
we invest in investment grade financial instruments to reduce our exposure related to investments 
our primary market risk exposure with regard to such financial instruments is to changes in interest rates  which would impact interest income earned on investments 
a change in interest rates of one point would not have a material impact on our operating results and cash flows 
we record as a liability the fair value of warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock 
the fair value of the stock warrant liability  at december  is determined using the black scholes option valuation model and is therefore sensitive to changes in the stock price and volatility of our common stock 
our primary market risk exposure to the stock warrant liability is to changes in the stock price  which would impact the valuation of the stock warrant liability 
increases in our stock price or the expected volatility of our common stock would increase the fair value of the stock warrant liability and therefore result in an additional loss on the statement of operations 
decreases in these items would decrease the fair value of the stock warrant liability and therefore result in an additional gain on the statement of operations 
substantially all our revenue is derived from outside of north america 
all revenue is primarily denominated in us dollars and therefore we bear no significant foreign exchange risk
