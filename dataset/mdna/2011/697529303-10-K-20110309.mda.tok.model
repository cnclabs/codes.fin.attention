as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and marketable securities and other investments 
our stockholders equity decreased year over year  mainly driven by our million net loss 
our current ratio defined as current assets divided by current liabilities is x  down from x at the end of at december   we had no borrowings 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition  available for sale and marketable securities valuation  accounts receivable valuation  inventory valuation  warranty provision  stock based compensation  fair value measurements  income tax valuation  and contingencies 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec guidance on revenue recognition 
the sec s guidance requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectability of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine that these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we recognize product revenues upon shipment 
if a product sale does not meet all of the above criteria  the revenue from the sale is deferred until all criteria are met 
provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for any applicable warranty costs expected to be incurred 
periodically  we sell products together with a product upgrade option that requires that the customer pay an upgrade fee at the time of exercise  has no refund provisions and includes an expiration date on the upgrade option 
in accordance with the emerging issues task force eitf guidance on accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we defer the fair value ascribed to the upgrade option until the expiration of the upgrade option or the exercise of the upgrade option and shipment of the product upgrade 
revenues from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the service contract 
revenues from services administered by us that are not covered by a service contract are recognized as the services are provided 
in certain instances  we sell products together with service contracts 
we recognize revenue on such multiple element arrangements in accordance with applicable sec and eitf guidance  based on the relative fair market value of each element 
we generally recognize royalty revenue from licensees upon receipt of cash payments since the royalty amounts are not determinable at the end of each quarter 
licensees are obligated to make payments to us between and days after the end of each quarter 
if at the end of a quarter royalty revenue from licensees are determinable  we record royalty revenue during the period earned 
periodically  as we sign on new licensees  we recognize back owed royalties in the period in which it is determinable and earned 
we have the right under our license agreements to engage independent auditors to review the royalty calculations 
the amounts owed as a result of these audits may be higher or lower than previously recognized 
in the past  we have had funded product development revenue from development agreements with johnson johnson and p g gillette 
for both johnson johnson and gillette  we have received payments in accordance with the work plans that were developed with each of johnson johnson and gillette 
revenue is recognized under the contracts as costs are incurred and services are rendered 
any amounts received in advance of costs incurred and services rendered are recorded as deferred revenue 
payments are not refundable if the development is not successful 
available for sale and marketable security investments 
investment securities  which primarily consist of corporate preferred securities  state and municipal auction rate securities  and variable rate demand obligations  are classified as marketable securities under the debt and equity securities topic of the fasb accounting standards codification and are recorded at fair market value 
any unrealized gains and losses  net of income tax effects  would be computed on the basis of specific identification and reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in our consolidated statements of stockholders equity 
we evaluate unrealized losses to determine if the loss is other than temporary 
if the loss is other than temporary  it is separated into two amounts  one amount representing a credit loss and the other representing an impairment due to all other factors 
the amount representing a credit loss is recorded in earnings  while the remaining impairment is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  as we do not have the intent to sell the impaired investments  nor do we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell these investments before the recovery of their cost basis 
accounts receivable reserves 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer receivable balances  we make assumptions with respect to their future collectability 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
generally  these individual credit assessments occur prior to the inception of the credit exposure and at regular reviews during the life of the exposure and consider a a customer s ability to meet and sustain their financial commitments  b a customer s current and projected financial condition  c the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook  and d the economy in general 
once we consider all of these factors  a determination is made as to the probability of default 
an appropriate provision is made  which takes into account the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding receivable balance based on our experience in collecting these amounts 
our level of reserves for our customer accounts receivable fluctuates depending upon all of the factors mentioned above 
we provide an additional reserve for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  historical experiences of write offs and defaults 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
included in our inventory are demonstration products that are used by our sales organization 
we account for such products as we do with any other finished goods item in our inventory in accordance with the review of our entire inventory 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although we perform a detailed review of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
warranty provision 
we typically offer a one warranty for our base products 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty reserves include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty repairs and the cost per repair 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our estimated warranty obligation is affected by ongoing product failure rates  specific product class failures outside of our baseline experience  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
assumptions and historical warranty experience are evaluated to determine the appropriateness of such assumptions 
we assess the adequacy of the warranty provision and we may adjust this provision if necessary 
stock based compensation 
we recognize stock based compensation expense in accordance with fasb codification topic regarding stock compensation 
this guidance requires share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock units and stock settled stock appreciation rights sars  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option and sar grants 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options and sars include the exercise price of the award  the expected option term  the expected volatility of our stock over the option or sar s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the option or sar s expected term and our expected annual dividend yield 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our common stock  the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options or sars granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns  and the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option or sar 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and currently have no intention to pay cash dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our income from operations  net income  and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods  and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our stock option and sar grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options and sars  may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
fair value measurements 
the performance of fair value measurements is an integral part of the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell the asset or paid to transfer the liability in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell or transfer such an asset or liability 
selection of the appropriate valuation technique  as well as determination of assumptions  risks and estimates used by market participants in pricing the asset or liability requires significant judgment 
although we believe that the inputs used in our valuation techniques are reasonable  a change in one or more of the inputs could result in an increase or decrease in the fair value of certain assets and certain liabilities and could have an impact on both our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations 
to value our auction rate securities  we determined the present value of the auction rate securities at the balance sheet date by discounting the estimated future cash flows based on a fair value rate of interest and an expected time horizon to liquidity 
as there is currently no liquid and active secondary market for these investments  their valuation required management s judgment 
income taxes 
under fasb accounting standards codification topic regarding income taxes  we can only recognize a deferred tax asset for future benefit of our tax loss  temporary differences and tax credit carry forwards to the extent that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized 
since  we incurred operating losses in foreign jurisdictions 
we believe that it is more likely than not that the associated tax asset will not be utilized 
therefore  we have established a full valuation allowance in and on this deferred tax asset 
in and  we recorded a valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
in evaluating the ability to recover these deferred tax assets  we considered all available positive and negative evidence  giving greater weight to the recent current loss  the absence of taxable income in the carry back period and the uncertainty regarding our ability to project financial results in future periods 
in addition to the tax assets described above  we have deferred tax assets totaling approximately million  resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
recognition of these assets would occur upon utilization of these deferred tax assets to reduce taxes payable and would result in a credit to additional paid in capital within stockholders equity 
for   and  the impact to paid in capital resulting from the exercise and expiration of employee stock options was million  million and million  respectively 
in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions  we accrue charges for possible exposures 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted 
contingencies 
in accordance with the fasb s guidance on accounting for contingencies  we accrue for all direct costs associated with the estimated resolution of contingencies at the earliest date at which it is deemed probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of such liability can be reasonably estimated 
at december   we have not recorded any material loss contingencies

liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  a year over year comparison of key components of our liquidity and capital resources in thousands 
to year ended december  change change cash flows used in from operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows used in from financing activities capital expenditures  including construction in process additionally  our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  accounts receivable  inventories  marketable securities and other investments  and working capital are shown below for the periods indicated in thousands 
to at december  change change cash  cash equivalents and short term investments accounts receivable  net inventories  net marketable securities and other investments working capital as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  and marketable securities and other investments

at december   we held million in auction rate securities ars which consisted of million of preferred municipal securities and million of preferred auction rate securities 
the ars we invest in are high quality securities  none of which are mortgage backed 
beginning in february  our securities failed at auction due to a decline in liquidity in the ars and other capital markets 
we will not be able to access our investments in ars until future auctions are successful  ars are called for redemption by the issuers  or until sold in a secondary market

cash provided by operating activities decreased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this decrease primarily reflects the effects of an increase in working capital requirements and a current year net loss which includes more cash related outflows than the prior year s net loss

outstanding balances on the revolving note bore interest at a rate equal to the sum of the libor advantage rate plus per annum 
at december  and  we had no outstanding debt 
any outstanding debt would have been due on december  on january   we repaid the million borrowed as of december  on november   we purchased land for million on which we built our new operational facility

the timing and actual number of shares purchased will depend on a variety of factors such as price  corporate and regulatory requirements  alternative investment opportunities and other market conditions 
stock repurchases under this program  if any  will be made using our cash resources  and may be commenced or suspended at any time or from time to time at management s discretion without prior notice 
during the year ended december   we did not purchase any of our common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  and a decline in the stock market 
the current turbulence in the us and global financial markets has caused a decline in stock values across all industries 
we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalents  short term investments  corporate preferred securities  and municipal debt securities is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial because of the historically short term nature of these investments 
at december   we held million in auction rate securities ars 
the ars we invest in are high quality securities  none of which are mortgage backed 
beginning in february  our securities failed at auction due to a decline in liquidity in the ars and other capital markets 
we will not be able to access our investments in ars until future auctions are successful  ars are called for redemption by the issuers  or until sold in a secondary market 
as our investments in ars currently lack short term liquidity  we have reclassified these investments as non current as of december  during fiscal   and  we sold million  million  and million  respectively  of our ars 
the recovery of the remaining million ars held is based upon market factors which are not within our control 
our international subsidiaries in the netherlands  australia  and japan conduct business in both local and foreign currencies and therefore  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currencies 
this risk could adversely impact our results and financial condition 
we have not entered into any foreign currency exchange and option contracts to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk and the corresponding variability in operating results as a result of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
