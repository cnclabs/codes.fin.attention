item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section includes a discussion of our operations for the three years ended august   and the following discussion and analysis provides information which management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto in part ii  item of this report and the selected financial data contained in part ii  item of this report 
business we are one of the nation s largest recyclers of ferrous and nonferrous scrap metal  a leading recycler of used and salvaged vehicles and a manufacturer of finished steel products 
we operate in three reporting segments mrb  apb and smb that collectively provide an end of life cycle solution for a variety of products through our integrated businesses 
we use operating income loss to measure our segment performance 
corporate expense consists primarily of unallocated expense for management and administrative services that benefit all three reporting segments 
as a result of this unallocated expense  the operating income loss of each reporting segment does not reflect the operating income loss the reporting segment would have as a stand alone business 
for further information regarding our reporting segments  including financial information about geographic areas  see note segment information in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
mrb buys  collects  processes  recycles  sells and brokers ferrous scrap metal containing iron to foreign and domestic steel producers  including smb  and nonferrous scrap metal not containing iron to both foreign and domestic markets 
mrb processes mixed and large pieces of scrap metal into smaller pieces by crushing  sorting  shearing  shredding and torching  resulting in scrap metal pieces of a size  density and purity required by customers to meet their production needs 
apb procures used and salvaged vehicles and sells serviceable used auto parts from these vehicles through its self service auto parts stores 
the remaining portions of the vehicles  primarily autobodies  core parts and nonferrous materials  are sold to metal recyclers  including mrb where geographically feasible 
smb operates a steel mini mill that produces a wide range of finished steel products 
mrb is the sole supplier for smb s scrap metal requirements  which smb purchases at rates that approximate export market prices for shipments from the west coast of the us smb uses its mini mill near portland  oregon to melt recycled metal and other raw materials to produce finished steel products 
smb also maintains a mill depot in southern california 
our results of operations depend in large part on the demand and prices for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets 
our deep water port facilities on both the east and west coasts of the us in everett  massachusetts  oakland  california  portland  oregon  tacoma  washington  and providence  rhode island and access to public deep water port facilities in kapolei  hawaii and salinas  puerto rico allow us to efficiently meet the global demand for ferrous scrap metal by shipping bulk cargoes to steel manufacturers located in europe  asia  central america and africa 
our exports of nonferrous processed scrap metal are shipped in containers through various public docks to specialty steelmakers  foundries  aluminum sheet and ingot manufacturers  copper refineries and smelters  brass and bronze ingot manufacturers and wire and cable producers globally 
we also transport both ferrous and nonferrous metals by truck and rail to meet regional domestic demand 
in particular  our processing facilities in the southeastern us also provide efficient access to the automobile and steel manufacturing industries in that region 
key economic factors and trends affecting the industries in which we operate our financial results largely depend on supply of raw materials in the us and demand for recycled metal in foreign and domestic markets and for finished steel products in the western us fluctuating or volatile supply and demand conditions affect market prices for and volumes of recycled ferrous and nonferrous metal in global markets and for steel products in the western us and can have a significant impact on the results of operations for all three reporting segments 
in fiscal  the us economy began to show some signs of a gradual recovery as evidenced by increased us steel mill utilization over the prior year and slightly improved availability of raw materials 
continued growth and positive economic conditions in overseas markets  particularly in asia  led to a continuing strong demand for exports of ferrous and nonferrous recycled materials 
schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents strategic factors as we continue to closely monitor the economic situation  we remain focused on the following core strategies to meet our business objectives use of our seven deep water ports to access customers directly around the world and to meet demand wherever it is greatest  growth through acquisitions in existing and new geographic regions that generate attractive returns  continued investment in and benefit from technologies and process improvements which increase the separation and recovery of recycled materials from our shredding process  and continued improvement in our productivity  focus on increasing efficiency and optimization of the spreads between our selling prices and the cost of acquiring materials 
in addition  we highly value the strategic synergies within our integrated operations 
apb is a key supplier to mrb  and we opportunistically look to enhance the geographic proximity of the two businesses 
in fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets of two metals recycling businesses in canada  with a total of nine metal collection and processing facilities  which marked mrb s first expansion into canada 
apb has three facilities in western canada that will be able to supply these new mrb facilities in addition to shipping to our tacoma  wa facility 
we also acquired substantially all of the assets of a used auto parts business with three stores in seattle  wa  expanding apb s presence in the northwestern us mrb has a significant presence in tacoma  wa  which will benefit from the synergies of this enhanced access to supply 
executive overview of financial results in fiscal  our operating results benefited from continuing strong demand from export markets as well as recovering domestic demand for scrap and recycled metal products and incremental revenues from acquisitions 
the increased demand led to higher average net selling prices and increased availability of raw materials  which resulted in revenues growing by billion to billion and net income attributable to ssi of million compared to million in fiscal diluted net income attributable to ssi was per share for fiscal compared to per share in fiscal during fiscal  we continued to expand our presence in regions in which we operate and in new locations through the acquisition of ten businesses 
the aggregate purchase price paid for acquisitions during fiscal was million  compared to million during fiscal

in fiscal  our mrb segment generated revenues of billion  a billion increase from fiscal  which included an million  or  increase in ferrous revenues and a million  or  increase in nonferrous revenues due to increased demand from both export and domestic markets  which  together with increased availability of raw materials  contributed to higher average net selling prices and sales volumes 
the increase in ferrous revenues was driven by a increase in average net selling price and a increase in long tons sold 
the increase in nonferrous revenues was driven by a increase in the average net selling price and a increase in pounds sold 
mrb had operating income of million compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  our apb segment generated revenues of million  a million increase from fiscal the increase over fiscal was primarily driven by a million increase in scrap vehicle revenue and a million increase in core revenue mainly due to higher selling prices and sales volumes  and a million increase in parts revenues 
apb had operating income of million compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  our smb segment generated revenues of million  a million increase from fiscal the increase over fiscal reflected an increase in the average net selling price of finished steel products of per ton  or  to per ton 
this was partly offset by a decrease in sales volumes for finished steel products of thousand tons  or  to thousand tons in fiscal the increases in average net selling price reflected improved  but still weak  demand for finished steel products in western north america

table of contents revenues fiscal compared with fiscal revenues for fiscal increased for all reporting segments primarily due to higher average net selling prices and higher sales volumes resulting from stronger worldwide demand from export markets as well as recovering domestic demand for scrap and recycled metal  increased availability of raw materials  including improved recovery through enhanced processing technologies 
incremental revenues from third party sales generated by fiscal acquisitions were million 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues in fiscal increased for all reporting segments primarily due to continuing strong worldwide demand for scrap and recycled metal  which led to higher average net selling prices and sales volumes  and to a lesser extent increased western us demand for finished steel products

operating income reflected an increase of million in consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expense for fiscal  primarily due to an million increase in compensation expenses mainly related to increased headcount from recent acquisitions and a million increase in professional and other third party services  including transaction costs associated with acquisitions completed in fiscal in fiscal  sg a expense was reduced by million for favorable customer contract settlements  compared to a reduction of million in fiscal in addition  sg a expense was lower in fiscal as it included million in benefits from favorable legal settlements and environmental cost reimbursements 
fiscal compared with fiscal as a percentage of revenues  operating income increased by percentage points for fiscal compared to fiscal this improvement in operating income was primarily due to higher average net selling prices  which increased more than the average cost of raw materials  and increased availability of raw materials  which improved operating margins 
the improvement in consolidated operating income also benefited from a decrease in consolidated sg a expense of million to million for fiscal the decrease included million in higher bad debt expense recognized in the prior year  million in fiscal benefits recognized from favorable customer contract and legal settlements  million in environmental and legal cost reimbursements  including million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and million in reduced professional service fees 
these decreases were partially offset by an million increase in incentive compensation due to improvements in financial performance and the reinstatement of employer contributions to our defined contribution plans effective april  and by million of increased expense related to the amortization of intangibles 
interest expense interest expense was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase from fiscal to fiscal is the result of higher outstanding debt and higher average interest rates under our amended bank credit facility

fiscal compared with fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of  primarily due to the lower tax rate for foreign income and domestic production activities deductions 
the fiscal effective tax rate also benefited from certain adjustments recorded in the period  including a recognition of research and development credits and a reduction in a reserve for unrecognized state income tax benefits 
in addition  during the fourth schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents quarter of fiscal  we recorded an adjustment to correct an error that originated in a prior period pertaining to deferred tax liabilities related to our investment in a subsidiary 
the correction of this error resulted in a reduction of income tax expense and an increase to net income of million for the year ended august  see note income taxes in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report for further discussion of the correction 
fiscal compared with fiscal our effective tax rate for fiscal was provision on income compared to benefit on a loss for fiscal the level of the decrease in the effective rate primarily reflects the impact of tax credits on lower taxable income loss in fiscal compared with fiscal  a lower state tax rate in fiscal resulting from the reduction in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits and a more favorable manufacturing deduction in fiscal which included the restoration of a previously disallowed deduction due to a newly enacted law 
fiscal also included a reduction in the reserve for unrecognized tax benefits  which increased the effective rate benefit on the loss

the fiscal average ferrous recycled metal sales price to smb was significantly higher than the average foreign sales price because when compared to foreign customers  sales to smb were greater in volume during the first quarter of the fiscal year  when sales prices were higher  than in the latter three quarters 
fiscal compared with fiscal revenues the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to higher average net selling prices and higher sales volumes caused by increased demand  availability of raw materials and incremental volume from acquisitions 
the increase in ferrous revenues was primarily driven by higher average net selling prices and higher sales volumes 
the average net ferrous selling price increased per long ton during fiscal primarily due to stronger demand from export markets as schnitzer steel industries  inc form k

fiscal compared with fiscal revenues the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to higher ferrous average net selling prices and higher nonferrous sales volumes  caused by increased demand for and availability of scrap metal 
ferrous revenues increased million  or  to billion for fiscal the increase in ferrous revenues was primarily driven by higher average net selling prices 
we experienced increasing prices during the year as the average net ferrous selling price increased per long ton  or  compared to the prior year due to strong demand in asian markets and to a lesser extent improved demand in domestic markets  which provided support to both domestic and foreign selling prices 
nonferrous revenues increased million  or  to million for fiscal the increase in nonferrous revenues was driven by increases in both the average nonferrous net selling price and sales volumes 
the average net selling price increased  or  to per pound during fiscal primarily due to stronger demand

an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we deem critical accounting policies to be those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we are not currently aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
our critical accounting estimates include those related to inventory  goodwill valuation  environmental costs  accounting for business combinations  revenue recognition and redeemable noncontrolling interest 
inventories our inventories primarily consist of scrap metal ferrous  nonferrous  processed and unprocessed  nonferrous recovered joint product  used and salvaged vehicles  semi finished steel products billets and finished steel products primarily rebar  merchant bar and wire rod 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we consider estimated future selling prices when determining the estimated net realizable value for our inventory 
as mrb generally sells its export recycled ferrous metal under contracts that provide for shipment within to days after the price is agreed  it utilizes the selling prices under committed contracts and sales orders for determining the estimated market price of quantities on hand 
the accounting process we use to record metal quantities relies on significant estimates 
with respect to unprocessed metal inventory  we rely on weighed quantities that are reduced by estimated amounts that are moved into production 
these estimates utilize estimated recoveries and yields that are based on historical trends 
over time  these estimates are reasonably good indicators of what is ultimately produced  however  actual recoveries and yields can vary depending on product quality  moisture content and source of the unprocessed metal 
if ultimate recoveries and yields are significantly different than estimated  the value of our inventory could be materially overstated or understated 
to assist in validating the reasonableness of these estimates  we periodically review shrink factors and perform monthly physical inventory estimates 
however  due to variations in product density  holding period and production processes utilized to manufacture the product  physical inventories will not necessarily detect all variances 
to mitigate this risk  we adjust the ferrous physical inventories when the volume of a commodity is low and a physical inventory count can more accurately predict the remaining volume

table of contents goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the second fiscal quarter and upon the occurrence of certain triggering events or substantive changes in circumstances that indicate that the fair value of goodwill may be impaired 
impairment of goodwill is tested at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment referred to as a component 
the company has determined that its reporting units  for which goodwill has been allocated  are equivalent to the company s operating segments mrb  apb and smb  as all of the components of each segment have similar economic characteristics 
the goodwill impairment test follows a two step process 
in the first step  the fair value of a reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed for purposes of measuring the impairment 
in the second step  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit to determine an implied goodwill value 
this allocation is similar to a purchase price allocation 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
in the event of a divestiture of a business unit within a reporting unit  goodwill of the reporting unit is allocated to that business unit based on the estimated fair value of the unit being divested to the total estimated fair value of the reporting unit and a gain or loss is determined 
the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit from which the assets were divested is subsequently re evaluated for impairment 
given that market prices of our reporting units are not readily available  determining their fair value involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting units using an income approach based on the present value of expected future cash flows utilizing a market based weighted average cost of capital wacc 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  pricing expectations and general market conditions 
to estimate the present value of the cash flows that extend beyond the final year of the discounted cash flow model  we employ a terminal value technique  whereby we use estimated operating cash flows minus capital expenditures and adjust for changes in working capital requirements in the final year of the model  then discount it by the wacc to establish the terminal value 
in addition  we compare the aggregated estimated fair value of our reporting units to our market capitalization  including consideration of a control premium 
the control premium represents the estimated amount an investor would pay to obtain a controlling interest 
we believe this reconciliation is consistent with a market participant perspective 
based on our impairment test performed during the second quarter of fiscal year  the estimated fair value of our reporting units substantially exceeded their carrying values 
environmental costs we operate in industries that inherently possess environmental risks 
to manage these risks  we employ both our own environmental staff and outside consultants 
environmental staff and finance personnel meet regularly to discuss environmental risks 
we estimate future costs for known environmental remediation requirements and accrue for them on an undiscounted basis when it is probable that we have incurred a liability and the related costs can be reasonably estimated but the timing of incurring the estimated costs is unknown 
the regulatory and government management of these projects is complex  which is one of the primary factors that make it difficult to assess the cost of potential and future remediation 
when only a wide range of estimated amounts can be reasonably established and no other amount within the range is better than any other  the low end of the range is recorded in the financial statements 
if further developments or resolution of an environmental matter result in facts and circumstances that are significantly different than the assumptions used to develop these reserves  the accrual for environmental remediation could be materially understated or overstated 
adjustments to these liabilities are made when additional information becomes available that affects the estimated costs to study or remediate any environmental issues or when expenditures for which reserves are established are made 
the factors we consider in the recognition and measurement of environmental liabilities include current regulations  both at the time the reserve is established and during the course of the investigation or remediation process  which specify standards for acceptable remediation  information about the site which becomes available as the site is studied and remediated  the professional judgment of senior level internal staff  who take into account similar  recent instances of environmental remediation issues  and studies of our sites  among other considerations  technologies available that can be used for remediation  and the number and financial condition of other potentially responsible parties and the extent of their responsibility for the costs of study and remediation 
our accrued environmental liabilities as of august  included million related to third party investigation costs for the portland harbor superfund site 
although future costs for the portland harbor superfund site could be material to our financial schnitzer steel industries  inc form k 
table of contents position  results of operations  liquidity or cash flows  it is not possible to estimate additional costs which we might incur in connection with the ongoing investigations and remediation because there has not been a determination of the total investigation costs  the remediation that will be required  the amount of natural resource damages or how the costs of the ongoing investigations and any remedy and natural resource damages will be allocated among the prps 
therefore  no additional amounts have been accrued 
see contingencies environmental in note commitments and contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
business combinations in a business combination  we recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  generally using a market based income approach 
measuring assets and liabilities at fair value requires us to determine the price that would be paid by a third party market participant based on the highest and best use of the assets or interests acquired 
we utilize management estimates that incorporate input from an independent third party valuation firm in our determination of these fair values 
such estimates and valuations require us to make significant assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance and determining the highest and best use of the assets or interests acquired 
acquisition costs are expensed as incurred 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when we have a contract or purchase order from a customer with a fixed price  the title and risk of loss transfer to the buyer and collectibility is reasonably assured 
title for both metal and finished steel products transfers based on contract terms 
a significant portion of our ferrous export sales of recycled metal are made with letters of credit  reducing credit risk 
however  domestic recycled ferrous metal sales  nonferrous sales and sales of finished steel are generally made on open account 
nonferrous export sales typically require a deposit prior to shipment 
all sales made on open account are evaluated for collectibility prior to revenue recognition 
additionally  when detailed documents support revenue recognition based on transfer of title and risk of loss we recognize revenues on partially loaded shipments  which requires an estimate of the product weight involved in any partial shipments at period end 
for apb  retail revenues are recognized when customers pay for parts and wholesale product revenues are recognized when customer weight certificates are received following shipment 
historically  there have been very few sales returns and adjustments that impact the ultimate collection of revenues  therefore  no material provisions have been made when the sale is recognized 
we present taxes assessed by governmental authorities collected from customers on a net basis 
therefore  the taxes are excluded from revenue and are shown as a liability on our consolidated balance sheets until remitted 
see the discussion on credit risk contained in item a of this report 
redeemable noncontrolling interest we have issued redeemable common stock to the noncontrolling interest holder of one of our subsidiaries that is redeemable both at the option of the holder and upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control 
if the interest were to be redeemed  we would be required to purchase all of such interest at fair value on the date of redemption 
we estimate fair value using level inputs under the fair value hierarchy based on standard valuation techniques using a discounted cash flow analysis 
any adjustments to the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interest prior to exercise of the redemption option will be recorded to equity 
since redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of our control  these interests are presented on the consolidated balance sheets in the mezzanine section under the caption redeemable noncontrolling interests 
the determination of fair value requires management to apply significant judgment in formulating estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include forecasts of future cash flows based on management s best estimate of future sales and operating costs  pricing expectations  capital expenditures  working capital requirements  discount rates  growth rates  tax rates and general market conditions 
as a result of the inherent uncertainty associated with forming these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are exposed to commodity price risk  mainly associated with variations in the market price for finished steel products  ferrous and nonferrous metals  including scrap metal  autobodies and other commodities 
the timing and magnitude of industry cycles are difficult to predict and are impacted by general economic conditions 
we respond to increases and decreases in forward selling prices by adjusting purchase prices on a timely basis 
we actively manage our exposure to commodity price risk and monitor the actual and expected spread between forward selling prices and purchase costs and processing and shipping expense 
sales contracts are based on prices negotiated with our customers  and generally orders are placed to days ahead of shipment date 
however  financial results may be negatively impacted when forward selling prices fall more quickly than we can adjust purchase prices or when customers fail to meet their contractual obligations 
we assess the net realizable value of inventory nrv each quarter based upon contracted sales orders and estimated future selling prices 
based on contracted sales and estimates of future selling prices at august  and  a decrease in the selling price per ton of finished steel products would have caused an nrv inventory write down of approximately million at smb 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates related to our debt obligations 
our credit line and revolving credit facility are subject to variable interest rates and therefore have exposure to changes in interest rates 
if market interest rates had changed from actual interest rate levels in fiscal or  the effect on our interest expense and net income would not have been material 
credit risk credit risk relates to the risk of loss that might occur as a result of non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations to take delivery of scrap metal and finished steel products and to make financial settlements of these obligations 
we manage our exposure to credit risk through a variety of methods  including shipping ferrous scrap metal exports under letters of credit  collection of deposits prior to shipment for certain nonferrous export customers and establishment of credit limits for sales on open terms 
mrb generally ships ferrous bulk sales to foreign customers under contracts supported by letters of credit issued or confirmed by banks it deems creditworthy 
the letters of credit ensure payment by the customer 
as mrb generally sells its export recycled ferrous metal under contracts or orders that generally provide for shipment within to days after the price is agreed  mrb s customers typically do not have difficulty obtaining letters of credit from their banks in periods of rising ferrous prices  as the value of the letters of credit are collateralized by the value of the inventory on the ship 
however  in periods of significantly declining prices  mrb s customers may not be able to obtain letters of credit for the full sales value of the inventory to be shipped 
as such  we may need to extend credit on open terms for the difference between the sales value under the contract and the value supported by the letter of credit 
in addition  we could be exposed to loss if a customer fails to pay or the bank providing the letter of credit fails 
as of august  and  and  respectively  of our trade accounts receivable balance was covered by letters of credit
