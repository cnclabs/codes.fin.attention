non gaap measures adjusted net income and adjusted diluted net income per share are supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by or presented in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for measures of performance prepared in accordance with gaap 
we calculate these non gaap measures by eliminating from net income and diluted net income per share the impact of items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operations 
we believe these adjusted measures provide additional information to facilitate the comparison of our past and present financial results 
we utilize results that both include and exclude the identified items in evaluating business performance 
however  our inclusion of these adjusted measures should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual or infrequent items

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part iv  item of this report  the risk factors included in part i  item a of this report  and the cautionary statements included throughout this report 
the inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information herein may require us to make estimates and assumptions in connection with our analysis of trends and expectations with respect to our results of operations and financial position taken as a whole 
as of february   we operated upscale  casual  full service dining restaurants under the cheesecake factory mark  under the grand lux cafe mark  and one under the rocksugar pan asian kitchen mark 
we also operated two bakery production facilities and licensed two limited menu bakery cafes under the cheesecake factory bakery cafe mark to another foodservice operator 
the cheesecake factory is an upscale  casual dining concept that offers more than menu items including appetizers  pizza  seafood  steaks  chicken  burgers  pasta  specialty items  salads  sandwiches  omelettes and desserts  including approximately varieties of cheesecake and other baked desserts 
grand lux cafe and rocksugar pan asian kitchen are also upscale  casual dining concepts offering approximately and menu items  respectively 
in contrast to many chain restaurant operations  substantially all of our menu items except certain desserts manufactured at our bakery production facilities are prepared on the restaurant premises using high quality  fresh ingredients based on innovative and proprietary recipes 
we believe our restaurants are recognized by consumers for offering value with generous food portions at moderate prices 
our restaurants distinctive  contemporary design and decor create a high energy ambiance in a casual setting 
our restaurants typically range in size from  to  interior square feet  provide full liquor service and are generally open seven days a week for lunch and dinner  as well as sunday brunch 
overview in addition to being highly competitive  the restaurant industry is affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns  changes in general economic conditions  public safety conditions  demographic trends  weather conditions  the cost and availability of food products  labor and energy  purchasing power  and government regulations 
accordingly  as part of our strategy we must constantly evolve and refine the critical elements of our restaurant concepts to protect our competitiveness and to maintain and enhance the strength of our brand 
our strategy is driven by our commitment to guest satisfaction and is focused primarily on menu innovation and operational execution to continue to differentiate ourselves from other restaurant concepts  as well as drive competitively strong performance that is sustainable 
financially  we are focused on prudently managing expenses at our restaurants  bakery facilities and corporate support center 
we are also committed to allocating capital in a manner that will maximize profitability and returns 
investing in new restaurant development that meets our return on investment criteria is our top capital allocation priority with a focus on opening our restaurant concepts in premier locations within both existing and new markets 
during fiscal  we target repurchasing at least million of our common stock  depending on company performance and market conditions 

table of contents in evaluating and assessing the performance of our business  we believe the following are key performance indicators that should be taken into consideration comparable restaurant sales and overall revenue growth 
changes in comparable restaurant sales come from variations in guest traffic  as well as changes in check average as a result of menu price increases and or changes in menu mix 
our strategy is to grow guest traffic by continuing to offer innovative  high quality menu items that offer guests a wide range of options in terms of flavor  price and value 
in addition  we plan to continue focusing on service and hospitality with the goal of delivering an exceptional guest experience 
our philosophy with regard to menu pricing is to use price increases to help offset key operating costs in a manner that balances protecting both our margins and guest traffic levels 
prior to the economic downturn  menu mix generally had a neutral effect on our average check  allowing us to retain the full impact of our menu price increases 
as the economy strengthens  we would expect this pattern to resume as guests focus less on check management 
comparable restaurant sales growth  in addition to revenue from new restaurant openings and increases in third party bakery sales  drive our overall revenue growth 
income from operations expressed as a percentage of revenues operating margins 
operating margins are subject to fluctuations in commodity costs  labor  restaurant level occupancy expenses  general and administrative expenses  and preopening expenses 
our objective is to gradually increase our operating margins by capturing fixed cost leverage from comparable restaurant sales increases  maximizing our purchasing power as our business grows  and operating our restaurants as productively as possible by retaining the efficiencies we gained through the implementation of cost management initiatives in fiscal and these initiatives  which improved our operational efficiency and reduced our restaurant level expenses  included developing menu items with favorable food costs  managing our commodity needs more efficiently  leveraging technology  such as our kitchen management system  and aligning the staffing in our restaurants with current sales volumes 
by efficiently scaling our restaurant and bakery support infrastructure and improving our internal processes  we strive to grow general and administrative expenses at a slower rate than revenue growth over the long term  which should also contribute to operating margin expansion 
return on investment 
return on investment measures our ability to make the best decisions regarding our allocation of capital 
returns are affected by the cost to build restaurants  the level of revenues that each restaurant can deliver and our ability to maximize the profitability of restaurants through operational execution and strict cost management 
our objective is to deploy capital in a manner that will maximize our return on investment 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  our consolidated statements of operations expressed as percentages of revenues fiscal year revenues costs and expenses cost of sales labor expenses other operating costs and expenses general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization expenses impairment of assets preopening costs total costs and expenses income from operations interest expense interest income other expense income  net income before income taxes income tax provision net income 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues increased to  million for fiscal compared to  million for fiscal restaurant sales increased to  million for fiscal compared to  million for the prior fiscal year 
the resulting sales increase of million consisted of a million increase in the cheesecake factory and grand lux cafe comparable restaurant sales and a million increase from restaurants not in the comparable sales base 
comparable sales at the cheesecake factory and grand lux cafe restaurants increased by from fiscal to fiscal at december   there were three the cheesecake factory restaurants not included in the comparable sales base 
the cheesecake factory and grand lux cafe restaurants become eligible to enter our comparable sales calculations in their th month of operation 
comparable sales at the cheesecake factory restaurants increased from fiscal driven primarily by improved guest traffic 
we implemented effective menu price increases of approximately and during the first and third quarter of fiscal  respectively 
on a weighted average basis  based on the timing of our menu roll outs within each quarter  the cheesecake factory menu included a increase in pricing for fiscal year ended december  this increase in menu pricing was partially offset by menu mix shifts due to ongoing check management by guests  particularly with regard to their purchase of non alcoholic beverages 
inclusive of our summer and winter menu changes  we will have implemented a targeted effective price increase of approximately for the first half of fiscal we plan to review our operating cost and expense trends in the spring of and consider the need for additional menu pricing in connection with our summer menu change 
comparable sales at our grand lux cafe restaurants increased from fiscal year  driven by improved guest traffic 
we did not implement any price increases in fiscal however  menu price increases made in fiscal had a year over year impact in fiscal on a weighted average basis  the grand lux menu included a increase in pricing for fiscal year ended december  this increase in menu pricing was offset by menu mix shifts due to ongoing check management by guests  particularly with regard to their purchase of non alcoholic beverages 
we generally update and reprint the menus in our restaurants twice a year 
as part of these menu updates  we evaluate the need for price increases based on those operating cost and expense increases of which we are aware or that we can reasonably expect 
while menu price increases can facilitate increased comparable restaurant sales in addition to offsetting margin pressure  we carefully consider all potential price increases in light of the extent to which we believe they will be accepted by our restaurant guests 
additionally  other factors outside of our control  such as general economic conditions  inclement weather  timing of holidays  and competitive and other factors  including those referenced in part i  item a  risk factors  of this report can impact comparable sales 
total restaurant operating weeks increased to  in fiscal from the prior year due to the opening of three new restaurants during the trailing month period 
in addition  average sales per restaurant operating week increased approximately to  in fiscal compared to the prior fiscal year due principally to the improvement in guest traffic 
bakery sales to other foodservice operators  retailers and distributors bakery sales increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year due primarily to increases in warehouse club and national account sales 
we strive to develop and maintain long term  growing relationships with our bakery customers  based largely on our year reputation for producing high quality and creative baked desserts 
however  it is difficult to predict the timing of bakery product shipments and contribution margins on a quarterly basis  as the purchasing plans of our large account customers may fluctuate 
due to the highly competitive nature of the bakery business  we are unable to enter into long term contracts with our large account bakery customers  who may discontinue purchasing our products without advance notice at any time for any reason 
cost of sales cost of sales consists of food  beverage  retail and bakery production supply costs incurred in conjunction with our restaurant 
table of contents and bakery revenues  and excludes depreciation  which is captured separately in depreciation and amortization expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales increased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this increase was due to cost pressures from certain commodities  primarily dairy and cheese  partially offset by pricing leverage and savings from our cost of sales initiatives  including the development of new menu items with lower food costs  negotiation of more favorable pricing for certain commodities and improvements in our supply chain 
our restaurant menus are among the most diversified in the foodservice industry and  accordingly  are not overly dependent on a few select commodities 
changes in costs for one commodity are often  but not always  counterbalanced by cost changes in other commodity categories 
the principal commodity categories for our restaurants include produce  poultry  meat  fish and seafood  cheese  other fresh dairy products  bread and general grocery items 
we attempt to negotiate short term and long term agreements for our principal commodity  supply and equipment requirements  depending on market conditions and expected demand 
however  we are currently unable to contract for long periods of time for certain of our commodities such as fish and most dairy items except for cream cheese used in our bakery operations 
consequently  these commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 
cream cheese is the most significant commodity used in our bakery products 
we contracted for a substantial portion of our fiscal cream cheese requirements and also purchased cream cheese on the spot market as necessary to supplement our contracted amounts 
as has been our past practice  we will carefully consider opportunities to introduce new menu items and implement selected menu price increases to help offset expected cost increases for key commodities and other goods and services utilized by our operations 
while we have been successful in the past in reacting to inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  varying menu mix  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the key commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations 
however  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for these commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
for new restaurants  cost of sales will typically be higher during the first to days of operations until our management team becomes more accustomed to optimally predicting  managing and servicing the sales volumes at the new restaurant 
labor expenses as a percentage of revenues  labor expenses  which include restaurant level labor costs and bakery direct production labor  including associated fringe benefits  decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this improvement was primarily due to overall productivity gains as a result of our operational initiatives  which included aligning the staffing in our restaurants with current sales volumes  leverage from positive comparable sales and lower stock based compensation 
the amount of stock based compensation included in labor was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses consist of restaurant level occupancy expenses rent  common area expenses  insurance  licenses  taxes and utilities  other operating expenses excluding food costs and labor expenses  which are reported separately and bakery production overhead  selling and distribution expenses 
as a percentage of revenues  other operating costs and expenses decreased to for fiscal versus for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to savings from our cost management initiatives  leverage of fixed costs due to positive comparable sales and favorable experience related to our self insured workers compensation and general liability plans 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses consist of the restaurant management recruiting and training program  as well as the restaurant field supervision  bakery administrative and corporate support organizations 
as a percentage of revenues  g a expenses decreased to for fiscal versus for fiscal this variance was primarily due to a million charge in fiscal resulting from a change in the amount and structure of the retirement benefit contained in the employment agreement with our chief executive officer  as well as to lower stock based compensation expense 
the amount of stock based compensation included in g a expense declined to million in fiscal from million in fiscal 
table of contents depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to leveraging from positive comparable sales  as well as to lower depreciation expense resulting from the impairment charge we recorded in fiscal discussed below in impairment of assets 
impairment of assets we assess potential impairment of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we regularly review restaurants that are cash flow negative for the previous four quarters to determine if impairment testing is warranted 
at any given time  we may be monitoring a small number of locations  and impairment charges could be triggered in the future if individual restaurant performance does not improve 
based on the results of this analysis  we recorded a million impairment charge against the carrying value of four grand lux cafe restaurants in fiscal no impairment charges were recorded in fiscal preopening costs preopening costs increased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we incurred preopening costs to open three the cheesecake factory restaurants in fiscal compared to opening one the cheesecake factory restaurant during fiscal preopening costs include all costs to relocate and compensate restaurant management employees during the preopening period  costs to recruit and train hourly restaurant employees  wages  travel and lodging costs for our opening training team and other support employees  and straight line minimum base rent during the build out and in restaurant training periods 
also included in preopening costs are expenses for maintaining a roster of trained managers for pending openings  the associated temporary housing and other costs necessary to relocate managers in alignment with future restaurant opening and operating needs  and corporate travel and support activities 
preopening costs can fluctuate significantly from period to period  based on the number and timing of restaurant openings and the specific preopening costs incurred for each restaurant 
interest expense  interest income and other income interest expense decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due primarily to lesser interest expense based on lower average outstanding debt balances during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
interest expense included million in both fiscal and to unwind interest rate collars in conjunction with reducing our revolving credit facility balance 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our long term debt and derivative financial instruments  respectively 
interest expense also included million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  associated with landlord construction allowances deemed to be financing in accordance with accounting guidance 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year due primarily to lower invested balances and lower interest rates on those invested balances during fiscal we recorded net other expense of million for fiscal compared to net other income of million for fiscal this variance primarily relates to changes in the value of our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our executive savings plan esp  a non qualified deferred compensation plan  and the realization in fiscal of million in proceeds from one of these contracts  as well as reductions in other miscellaneous income items 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase was primarily attributable to deleverage from employment related tax credits on higher pretax income  as well as lower non taxable gains on our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our esp  partially offset by the favorable resolution of our m dispute as to tax years and  as described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report 

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal revenues revenues decreased slightly to  million for fiscal compared to  million for fiscal restaurant sales decreased slightly to  million for fiscal compared to  million for the prior fiscal year 
the resulting sales decrease of million consisted of million decrease in comparable restaurant sales and a million increase from newer locations not in the comparable sales base 
comparable sales decreased by from fiscal to fiscal comparable sales at the cheesecake factory restaurants decreased from fiscal this decline was due to reduced traffic at our restaurants  which we believe was primarily driven by the macroeconomic factors affecting the restaurant industry in general  and was partially offset by a slightly higher check average 
we realized effective menu price increases of approximately and in the first and third quarters of  respectively 
comparable sales at our grand lux cafe restaurants decreased from fiscal year we realized effective menu price increases of approximately and in the second and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the decrease in grand lux cafe comparable sales is also attributable to a decline in guest traffic  which we believe was primarily driven by the macroeconomic factors affecting the restaurant industry in general 
total restaurant operating weeks increased to  in fiscal from the prior year primarily from the opening of three new restaurants during the trailing month period 
average sales per restaurant operating week decreased approximately in fiscal to  compared to the prior fiscal year 
this decrease in average weekly sales was due principally to the decline in guest traffic 
bakery sales decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
this decrease is primarily due to lower sales to our warehouse clubs and national accounts 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues  cost of sales decreased to during fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
approximately one half of this decrease was attributable to savings associated with our cost of sales initiatives  including the development of new menu items with lower food costs  negotiation of more favorable pricing for commodities and improvements in our supply chain 
the majority of the remaining cost of sales favorability stemmed from commodity price spikes that occurred in when prices were significantly higher for certain grocery  produce and dairy items as compared to the same periods in fiscal additionally  our bakery benefited from a favorable year over year contracted price for cream cheese 
labor expenses as a percentage of revenues  labor expenses decreased to in fiscal compared to in fiscal this decrease was primarily due to direct labor savings as a result of our operational initiatives  partially offset by higher health insurance costs and deleveraging from lower sales levels in fiscal as compared to the prior year 
stock based compensation included in labor was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the expense in the prior year period is net of a million reduction related to an adjustment to our estimated stock option forfeiture rate 
other operating costs and expenses as a percentage of revenues  other operating costs and expenses increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal this increase was primarily due to higher self insurance reserves  increased marketing expenses and deleveraging of fixed costs due to lower sales levels in fiscal these items were partially offset by benefits from operational cost saving initiatives and lower utility costs during fiscal 
table of contents general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues  g a expenses increased to for fiscal versus for fiscal the majority of this variance was due to an increase in the accrual for corporate performance bonuses in fiscal as compared to the comparable prior year period  as well as a million charge in fiscal resulting from a change in the amount and structure of the retirement benefit contained in the employment agreement with our chief executive officer 
g a expenses included million and million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the expense in the prior year period is net of a million reduction related to an adjustment to our stock option forfeiture rate 
depreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization expenses increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase is primarily due to deleveraging from lower average weekly sales at our restaurants 
impairment of assets we assess potential impairment of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we regularly review restaurants that are cash flow negative for the previous four quarters to determine if impairment testing is warranted 
at any given time  we may be monitoring a small number of locations  and impairment charges could be triggered in the future if individual restaurant performance does not improve 
based on the results of this analysis  we recorded a million impairment charge against the carrying value of four grand lux cafe restaurants in fiscal during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge against the carrying value of three the cheesecake factory locations 
preopening costs preopening costs decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior fiscal year 
we incurred preopening costs to open one the cheesecake factory restaurant in fiscal compared to opening six the cheesecake factory restaurants and our first rocksugar pan asian kitchen location during fiscal in addition  preopening costs were incurred in both years for restaurant openings in progress  maintaining a roster of trained managers for pending openings  and the associated temporary housing and other costs necessary to relocate managers in alignment with future restaurant opening and operating needs 
interest expense  interest income and other income interest expense increased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due primarily to costs totaling million to unwind two of our interest rate collars in conjunction with reducing our revolving credit facility balance 
in addition  we paid a higher interest rate on the outstanding balance of our debt during fiscal relative to the prior year as a result of an amendment to our revolving credit facility in january see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our long term debt and derivative financial instruments  respectively 
these increases to interest expense were partially offset by a lower average outstanding debt balance during fiscal as compared to the prior year 
interest expense also included million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively  associated with landlord construction allowances deemed to be financing in accordance with accounting guidance 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for the prior year due primarily to lower interest rates earned on invested balances during fiscal we recorded net other income of million for fiscal compared to net other expense of million for fiscal this variance primarily relates to changes in the value of our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our executive savings plan esp  a non qualified deferred compensation plan  as well as the realization in fiscal of million in proceeds from one of these contracts 
income tax provision our effective income tax rate was for fiscal compared to for fiscal this decline was primarily attributable to non taxable gains in fiscal compared to non deductible losses in fiscal on our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our esp  greater leverage from tax credits and incentives on lower book income in fiscal and a reserve recorded in fiscal for the potential disallowance of certain executive compensation under the provisions of internal 
table of contents revenue code section m 
the favorable rate impact of these items was partially offset by a rate benefit in fiscal for the irs approval of our change in method of accounting for construction allowances 
fiscal outlook this discussion contains forward looking statements and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in part iv  item of this report  the risk factors included in part i  item a of this report  and the cautionary statements included throughout this report 
the inclusion of supplementary analytical and related information herein may require us to make estimates and assumptions in connection with our analysis of trends and expectations with respect to our results of operations and financial position taken as a whole 
in fiscal  we plan to open as many as six to nine new restaurants 
we estimate diluted earnings per share for fiscal will be between and based on the assumption that comparable restaurant sales will increase in a range of between and 
we expect cash capital expenditures in fiscal to range between million and million 
we also target repurchasing at least million of our common stock  depending on company performance and market conditions 
we utilize a week fiscal year ending on the tuesday closest to december st for financial reporting purposes 
fiscal years  and consisted of weeks 
fiscal will be a week year  with an additional week in our fourth quarter 
the impact from the extra week is incorporated into our estimates 
liquidity and capital resources one of our corporate financial objectives is to maintain a sufficiently strong and conservative balance sheet to support our operating initiatives and unit growth with financial flexibility  to provide the financial resources necessary to protect and enhance the competitiveness of our restaurant and bakery brands  and to provide a prudent level of financial capacity to manage the risks and uncertainties of conducting our business operations in the current economic environment and through future economic and industry cycles 
our ongoing capital requirements are principally related to our restaurant expansion plan and ongoing maintenance of our restaurants and bakery facilities  as well as investment in our corporate and information technology infrastructures 
similar to many restaurant and retail chain store operations  we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements continue to provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
however  we are not limited to the use of lease arrangements as our only method of opening new restaurants 
while most of our operating lease obligations are not required to be reflected as indebtedness on our consolidated balance sheet  the minimum base rents and related fixed obligations under our lease agreements must be satisfied by cash flows from our ongoing operations 
accordingly  our lease arrangements reduce  to some extent  our capacity to utilize funded indebtedness in our capital structure 
historically  we have obtained capital from our ongoing operations  public stock offerings  debt financing  employee stock option exercises and construction contributions from our landlords 
our requirement for working capital is not significant  since our restaurant guests pay for their food and beverage purchases in cash or cash equivalents at the time of sale  and we are able to sell many of our food inventory items before payment is due to the suppliers of such items 
the following table presents  for the periods indicated  a summary of our key cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities dollar amounts in millions fiscal year cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures proceeds from exercise of employee stock options repayment borrowing on credit facility purchase of treasury stock during fiscal  our cash and marketable securities on hand increased by million to million at december  this increase was primarily attributable to cash provided by operating activities and proceeds from stock option exercises  partially offset by repayments on our credit facility and purchases of treasury stock and property and equipment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of cash and cash equivalents 

table of contents our restaurant development model closely resembles that of a retail business that occupies leased space in shopping malls  lifestyle centers  office complexes  strip centers  entertainment centers and other real estate developments 
we typically seek to lease our restaurant locations for primary periods of to years under operating lease arrangements 
our rent structures vary by lease  but generally provide for the payment of both minimum and contingent percentage rent based on net sales  as well as other expenses related to the leases for example  our pro rata share of common area maintenance  property tax and insurance expenses 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements and ff e to build out our leased premises 
we may also disburse cash for structural additions that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed upon terms in the respective leases 
if obtained  landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
we do not have any current plans to encumber our existing leasehold interests with lessee secured financing 
we own substantially all of the ff e in our restaurants and currently plan to do so in the future 
capital expenditures were lower in fiscal and compared to fiscal due to the number of restaurants opened in each year three  one and seven  respectively 
capital expenditures for new restaurants  including locations under development as of each fiscal year end were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
in fiscal  no capital expenditures were funded through deemed landlord financing 
fiscal capital expenditures also included million for maintenance and capacity addition outlays in our existing restaurants  and approximately million for bakery and corporate infrastructure investments 
for fiscal  we currently estimate our cash outlays for capital expenditures to range between million and million  net of agreed upon up front cash landlord construction contributions and excluding million of expected noncapitalizable preopening costs for new restaurants 
the amount reflected as additions to property and equipment in the consolidated statements of cash flows may vary from this estimate based on the accounting treatment of each operating lease see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report 
our estimate for capital expenditures for fiscal contemplates a net outlay of million to million for as many as six to nine restaurants to be opened during fiscal and estimated construction in progress disbursements for anticipated fiscal openings 
these amounts are net of estimated collections of up front cash landlord construction contributions 
expected capital expenditures for fiscal also include million to million for maintenance and capacity additions on our existing restaurants and million to million for bakery and corporate infrastructure investments 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under our million revolving credit facility facility 
availability under the facility is reduced by outstanding standby letters of credit  which are used to support our self insurance programs 
as of december   we had net availability for borrowings of million  based on million in standby letters of credit 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our long term debt 
during fiscal and  we entered into several zero cost interest rate collars that hedged interest rate variability on a portion of outstanding borrowings on our facility 
during fiscal and  in conjunction with repayments on our facility  we unwound our derivatives at a cost of million in each year 
we had no derivative instruments outstanding at december  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our derivative financial instruments 
we have an outstanding authorization from our board of directors to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
under this authorization  we have cumulatively repurchased a total of million shares at a total cost of million through december  the authorization does not have an expiration date  does not require us to purchase a specific number of shares and may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time 
in october  we suspended our share repurchase program in order to maintain maximum flexibility in our capital decisions in light of the unprecedented crisis in the global financial markets and the indeterminate future impact it could have on the overall economy and on our business 
in february  our board of directors reinstated our stock repurchase program and approved the adoption of a trading plan under rule b b plan under the securities exchange act of  as amended from time to time act  which was effective from march through december in february  our board of directors approved a new b plan  which will be effective from march  through february  in addition  the board of directors approved the terms of a share repurchase plan pursuant to which we are authorized to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market transactions in accordance with rule b of the exchange act of  such plan to be effective from february  through may  we target repurchasing at least million of our common stock  depending on company performance and market conditions 
the timing and number of shares repurchased pursuant to the share repurchase authorization are subject to a number of factors  including current market conditions  legal constraints  available cash or other sources of funding and financial covenants under our credit facility that limit share repurchases based on a defined leverage ratio 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our long term debt 
shares may be repurchased in the open 
table of contents market or through privately negotiated transactions at times and prices considered appropriate by us 
we make the determination to repurchase shares based on several factors  including an evaluation of current and future capital needs associated with new restaurant development  current and forecasted cash flows  a review of our capital structure and cost of capital  and our share price 
based on our current expansion objectives  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  combined with expected cash flows provided by operations  available borrowings under our credit facility and expected landlord construction contributions should be sufficient in the aggregate to finance our planned capital expenditures and other operating activities in fiscal as of december   we had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties 
additionally  we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following schedules summarize our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  amounts in millions payment due by period total less than year years years more than years contractual obligations leases long term debt purchase obligations uncertain tax positions total other commercial commitments standby letters of credit represents aggregate minimum lease payments for our restaurant operations  automobiles and certain equipment  including amounts characterized as deemed landlord financing payments in accordance with accounting guidance 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report 
most of our leases also require contingent rent in addition to the minimum base rent based on a percentage of sales ranging from to and require expenses incidental to the use of the property 
purchasing obligations represent commitments for the purchase of goods and estimated construction commitments  net of agreed upon up front landlord construction contributions 
amounts exclude agreements that are cancelable without significant penalty 
represents liability for uncertain tax positions 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of income taxes 
we expect to fund our contractual obligations primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments and uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation 
improvements are capitalized while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred 
depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of each asset or lease term  whichever is shorter 
the useful life of property and equipment and the determination as to what constitutes a capitalized cost versus a repair and maintenance expense involves judgment by management  which may produce materially different amounts of depreciation expense than if different assumptions were used 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets we assess potential impairment of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or asset group may not be recoverable 
factors considered include  but are not limited to  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we regularly review restaurants that are cash flow negative for the previous four quarters to determine if impairment testing is warranted 
at any given time  we may be monitoring a small number of locations  and impairment charges could be triggered in the future if individual restaurant performance does not improve 
we have determined that our asset group for impairment testing is comprised of the assets and liabilities of each of our individual restaurants  as this is the lowest level of identifiable cash flows 
we have identified leasehold improvements as the primary asset because it is the most significant component of our restaurant assets  is the principal asset from which our restaurants derive their cash flow generating capacity and has the longest remaining useful life 
the recoverability is assessed in most cases by comparing the carrying value of the assets to the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying values of the assets exceed their fair values 
this assessment process requires the use of estimates and assumptions regarding future cash flows and estimated useful lives  which are subject to a significant degree of judgment based on our experience and knowledge 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by changes in the economic environment  real estate market conditions and capital spending decisions 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge against the carrying value of four grand lux cafe locations 
during fiscal  we recorded a million impairment charge against the carrying value of three the cheesecake factory locations 
no impairment charges were recorded in fiscal if the current economic situation deepens in magnitude and or we are unable to implement initiatives to appropriately scale our infrastructure in a timely manner  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
leases we currently lease all of our restaurant locations 
we evaluate each lease to determine its appropriate classification as an operating or capital lease for financial reporting purposes 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
minimum base rent for our operating leases  which generally have escalating rentals over the term of the lease  is recorded on a straight line basis over the lease term 
the initial lease term includes the build out  or rent holiday period  for our leases  where no rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
contingent rent expense  which is based on a percentage of revenue  is recorded as incurred to the extent it exceeds minimum base rent per the lease agreement 
we disburse cash for leasehold improvements and ff e to build out and equip our leased premises 
we may also expend cash for structural additions that we make to leased premises that generally are reimbursed to us by our landlords as construction contributions pursuant to agreed upon terms in our leases 
landlord construction contributions usually take the form of up front cash  full or partial credits against minimum or percentage rents otherwise payable by us  or a combination thereof 
depending on the specifics of the leased space and the lease agreement  amounts paid for structural components are recorded during the construction period as either prepaid rent or construction in progress and the landlord construction contributions are recorded as either an offset to prepaid rent or as a deemed landlord financing liability 
upon completion of construction  we perform an analysis on the leases for which the structural cost was initially recorded to construction in progress to determine if they qualify for sale leaseback treatment 
for those qualifying leases  the deemed landlord financing liability and the associated construction in progress are removed and the difference is reclassified to either prepaid or deferred rent and amortized over the lease term as an increase or decrease to rent expense 
if the lease does not qualify for sale leaseback treatment  the deemed landlord financing liability is amortized over the lease term based on the rent payments designated in the lease agreement 
gift card revenue recognition we recognize a liability upon the sale of our gift cards and recognize revenue when these gift cards are redeemed in our restaurants or on our website 
based on our historical gift card redemption patterns  we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote  which is referred to as breakage 
breakage is recognized in proportion to historical redemption trends and is classified as revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
utilizing this method  we estimate both 
table of contents the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption 
if actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates  actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded 
self insurance liability we retain the financial responsibility for a significant portion of our risks and associated liabilities with respect to workers compensation  general liability  employment practices  employee health benefits and other insurable risks 
the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on our estimate of the ultimate costs to settle known claims as well as claims incurred but not yet reported to us ibnr as of the balance sheet date 
our estimated liabilities are not discounted and are based on information provided by our insurance brokers and insurers  combined with our judgment regarding a number of assumptions and factors  including the frequency and severity of claims  claims development history  case jurisdiction  applicable legislation and our claims settlement practices 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our individual claim exposure for many of our programs and for aggregate exposure on our employee health benefits program 
the estimated amounts receivable from our third party insurers under this coverage are recorded in other receivables 
significant judgment is required to estimate ibnr amounts as parties have yet to assert such claims 
if actual claims trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
stock based compensation we apply the black scholes valuation model in determining the fair value of stock option grants  which requires the use of subjective assumptions  including the volatility of our common stock price and the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options prior to exercise 
additionally  we estimate the expected forfeiture rate related to both stock options and restricted stock in determining the amount of stock based compensation expense for each period 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect our results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of stock based compensation 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities 
our estimates include  but are not limited to  effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income  and estimates related to depreciation expense allowable for tax purposes 
our estimates are made based on the best available information at the time we prepare our income tax provision 
in making our estimates  we also consider the impact of legislative and judicial developments 
as these developments evolve  we update our estimates  which  in turn  may result in adjustments to our effective tax rate 
we generally file our income tax returns within nine to ten months after our fiscal year end 
all tax returns are subject to audit by federal and state governments  usually years after the returns are filed  and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
we account for uncertain tax positions under financial accounting standards board guidance  which prescribes a minimum probability threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized 
the minimum threshold is defined as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon settlement 
assessment of uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments relating to the amounts  timing and likelihood of resolution 
our actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for a summary of new accounting standards 
impact of inflation and changes in the costs of key operating resources our operating margins depend on  among other things  on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in the costs of key operating resources  including food and other raw materials  labor  energy and other supplies and services 
substantial increases in costs and expenses could impact our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed along to our restaurant and bakery customers 
while we have taken steps to qualify multiple suppliers and enter into agreements for some of the commodities used in our restaurant and bakery operations  there can be no assurance that future supplies and costs for such commodities will not fluctuate due to weather and other market conditions outside of our control 
we are currently unable to contract for long periods of time for certain of our commodities such as fish and dairy items except for cream cheese used in our bakery operations 
consequently  these commodities can be subject to unforeseen supply and cost fluctuations 

table of contents our staff members are subject to various minimum wage requirements 
we operate in many states  including california  where the minimum wage is higher than the federal minimum and in such states our staff members receive compensation equal to the state s minimum wage 
there have been and may be additional minimum wage increases in excess of federal minimum wage implemented in various jurisdictions in which we operate or seek to operate 
minimum wage increases may have a material adverse effect on our labor costs 
certain operating costs  such as taxes  insurance and other outside services continue to increase with the general level of inflation or higher and may also be subject to other cost and supply fluctuations outside of our control 
while we have been able to partially offset inflation and other changes in the costs of key operating resources by gradually increasing prices for our menu items and bakery products  coupled with more efficient purchasing practices  productivity improvements and greater economies of scale  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future 
from time to time  competitive conditions could limit our menu pricing flexibility 
in addition  macroeconomic conditions could make additional menu price increases imprudent 
there can be no assurance that all future cost increases can be offset by increased menu prices or that increased menu prices will be fully absorbed by our restaurant guests without any resulting changes in their visit frequencies or purchasing patterns 
substantially all of the leases for our restaurants provide for contingent rent obligations based on a percentage of sales 
as a result  rent expense will absorb a proportionate share of any menu price increases in our restaurants 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to generate increases in comparable restaurant and bakery sales in amounts sufficient to offset inflationary or other cost pressures 
seasonality and quarterly results our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our highest levels of revenues for our established restaurants occur in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year 
approximately of our restaurants are located in or near retail centers and malls that typically experience seasonal fluctuations in sales 
patio seating represents approximately of the total available productive seating in our restaurants and can be subject to disruption from inclement weather 
quarterly results have been and will continue to be significantly impacted by the number and timing of new restaurant openings and their associated preopening costs and operating inefficiencies 
our bakery operations are seasonal to the extent that the fourth quarter s sales are typically higher due to holiday business 
additionally  bakery sales comparisons may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to the timing and size of orders from our larger bakery customers 
see item a risk factors seasonality of our business and the timing of new restaurant openings could result in fluctuations in our financial performance from quarter to quarter within a fiscal year and adverse weather conditions could unfavorably affect our restaurant sales 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results for any given quarter may not be indicative of the results that may be achieved for a full fiscal year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion of market risks contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from the following discussion based on general conditions in the financial and commodity markets 
we are exposed to market risk from interest rate changes on our funded debt 
this exposure relates to the component of the interest rate on our million revolving credit facility facility that is indexed to three month libor 
as of december   we had no debt outstanding under the facility 
therefore  we had no exposure to interest rate fluctuations on our funded debt at year end fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this report for further discussion of our long term debt 
we are also subject to market risk related to our investments in variable life insurance contracts used to support our esp  to the extent these investments are not equivalent to the related liability 
in addition  because changes in these investments are not taxable  the full impact of gains or losses affects net income 
based on balances at december  and december   a hypothetical decline in the market value of our deferred compensation asset and related liability would not impact income before income taxes 
however  net income would decline by million and million  respectively 
we purchase food and other commodities for use in our operations  based on market prices established with our suppliers 
many of the commodities purchased by us can be subject to volatility due to market supply and demand factors outside of our control 
to manage this risk in part  we periodically enter into fixed price purchase commitments  with terms typically up to one year  for many of our commodity requirements 
however  we are currently unable to contract for long period of time for certain of our commodities such as fish and most dairy items except for cream cheese used in our bakery operations 
dairy costs can also fluctuate due to government regulation 
substantially all of our food and supplies are available from multiple qualified suppliers  which helps to diversify our overall commodity cost risk 
in addition  we may have the ability to increase menu prices  or vary menu items  in response to food commodity price increases 
some of our commodity purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing certain price floors or caps 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  since our purchase arrangements with suppliers  to the extent that we can enter into such arrangements  help control the ultimate cost that we pay
