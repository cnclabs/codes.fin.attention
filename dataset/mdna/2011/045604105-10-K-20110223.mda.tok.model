overview 
we are engaged primarily in the ownership and operation of multifamily residential units 
our subsidiary  merit  is a general contractor that acts as our in house construction division and provides general contracting and construction management services to third parties 
our two primary sources of cash and revenue from operations are rents from the leasing of owned apartment units  which represented of our consolidated revenue and construction services  which represented of our consolidated revenue for the year ended december  the operating performance of our properties is affected by general economic trends including  but not limited to  factors such as household formation  job growth  unemployment rates  population growth  immigration  the supply of new multifamily rental communities and in certain markets the supply of other housing alternatives  such as condominiums  single and multifamily rental homes and owner occupied single and multifamily homes 
additionally  our performance may be affected by the access to  and cost of  debt and equity 
rental revenue collections are impacted by rental rates  occupancy levels and rent concessions 
we adjust our rental rates and concessions in our continuing efforts to adapt to changing market conditions and maximize rental revenue 
we continuously monitor physical occupancy and net collected rent per unit to track our success in maximizing rental revenue 
these indicators are more fully described in the results of operations comparison 
additionally  we consider property noi and ffo to be important indicators of our overall performance 
property noi property operating revenue less property operating and maintenance expenses is a measure of the profitability of our properties and has the largest impact on our financial condition and operating results 
ffo is used in the real estate industry as a supplemental measure of the operating performance of real estate companies because it excludes charges such as real estate depreciation that are generally considered not to be reflective of the actual value of real estate assets over time 
additionally  gains and losses from the sale of most real estate assets and certain other items are also excluded from ffo 
see selected financial data presented in part ii  item of this report on form k for reconciliations of property noi and ffo to consolidated net loss income in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our same community portfolio for the years and consists of properties containing  units and accounted for of total revenue in and of our property noi 
our same community portfolio includes our properties that we have owned and operated for the entire two year period ending december  same community noi increased in compared to primarily as a result of a  or increase in noi from our southeast portfolio 
our midwest portfolio noi increased  or while our mid atlantic portfolio noi declined  or in effective in october  merit  our wholly owned subsidiary  changed its concentration from a subcontractor and painting company to a general contractor that acts as our in house construction division and also provides general contracting and construction management services to third parties 
merit s revenue and expenses  which represent construction supervision for third parties and are recorded on the percentage of completion method  exceed merit s painting and subcontracting revenues and expenses recorded during the following table presents property noi results for and year ended december  in thousands property noi property noi same community properties midwest mid atlantic southeast total same community acquired properties development total property noi our earnings guidance anticipates the acquisition of approximately million to million of properties and the disposition of approximately zero to million of properties 
additionally  merit has commenced the development of a unit property  which is held by a partnership in which we are a partner 
we anticipate that our development costs on this project for will be approximately million to million 
we intend to continue to evaluate potential property acquisitions when our investment criteria warrants an acquisition 
we also may sell properties where market conditions are such that the reinvestment of cash proceeds derived from a sale are expected to provide  over time  a significantly greater return on equity  an increase in cash flow or further enhance our strategic objectives 
we will continue to focus on the ratio of our total debt and preferred stock to gross real estate assets which improved to at december  compared with at december  we will also continue to focus on the reduction of our overall weighted average interest rate on our borrowings  which improved to at december  compared with at december  and our fixed charge coverage ratio which improved to times at december  from times at december  in order to maximize property noi  we plan to continue to focus our efforts on improving revenue  controlling costs and realizing operational efficiencies at the property level  both regionally and portfolio wide 
in  at the midpoint of our guidance  we expect same community noi to increase  driven by a increase in property revenue and a increase in property operating expenses compared to however  the uncertainties caused by economic and financial conditions complicate our ability to forecast future performance 
we believe that the apartment industry is better situated to weather a continuing recessionary environment or delayed recovery than other real estate sectors because people will normally choose shelter over discretionary spending such as going to the mall or hotel stays and because government sponsored agencies such as fannie mae and freddie mac continue to provide attractive apartment financing  which may be unavailable to other commercial real estate sectors 
however  our expectations may be adversely impacted if recessionary forces resume or if congress curtails fannie mae or freddie mac financing support to the apartment industry 
moreover  unless and until real job growth occurs in our markets  significant rental growth may be limited 
federal income taxes 
we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended  commencing with our taxable year ending december  reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements including a requirement that of the income that would otherwise be considered as taxable income be distributed to shareholders 
providing we continue to qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal income tax on net income 
however  our two reit subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax 
a reit is precluded from owning more than of the outstanding voting securities of any one issuer  other than a wholly owned subsidiary or another reit  and more than of the value of all securities of any one issuer 
as an exception to this prohibition  a reit is allowed to own up to of the securities of a trs that can provide non customary services to reit tenants and others without disqualifying the rents that a reit receives from its tenants 
however  no more than of the value of a reit total assets can be represented by securities of one or more trs 
the amount of intercompany interest and other expenses between a trs and a reit are subject to arms length allocations 
we have elected trs status for our two reit subsidiaries 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows and liquidity 
significant sources and uses of cash in the past three years are summarized as follows significant cash sources uses year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operations fixed assets acquisitions and development expenditures  net net property disposition proceeds recurring  revenue enhancing and non recurring capital expenditures debt decrease in mortgage notes increase decrease in revolving credit facility borrowings redemption of trust preferred securities exercise of stock options common share issuances preferred share redemption cash dividends and operating partnership distributions paid purchase of preferred and or treasury shares our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow provided by operations  short term borrowings on the unsecured revolver  project specific loans and the sale of debt or equity securities 
our debt repayment obligations are relatively modest 
we had six mortgage loans totaling approximately million that matured in we repaid five of the maturing loans and refinanced the other one 
in  we have seven mortgage loans that mature totaling approximately million 
on february  we prepaid three of these loans having an outstanding balance of approximately million 
it is our intention to prepay the balance of the other four loans on march  the funding of the repayment of these loans will come from our unsecured revolver and or other secured or unsecured financings 
in december  we entered into a credit facility agreement with wells fargo multifamily corporation on behalf of freddie mac 
pursuant to the terms of the facility  we have the potential to borrow up to million over a two year period with obligations being secured by nonrecourse  non cross collateralized fixed or variable rate mortgages having terms of five  seven or ten years 
in august  we used this facility to borrow million at a fixed rate of for a term of years leaving million of availability under this facility 
in october  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement that among other things increased the maximum amount of borrowings under the revolver to million  extends the maturity date to october  and provides for a one year extension option 
the credit agreement also provides for an increase to the total facility to million upon our request and the agreement of the lenders participating in the facility 
at december  we had borrowings of million outstanding under this facility 
our ability to access the capital markets affords us additional liquidity as demonstrated by our sale of  of our common shares in in three separate underwritten offers to the public markets 
the net proceeds from these offerings  which totaled approximately million  were used to repay maturing debt  redeem all of our outstanding class b series ii cumulative redeemable preferred shares  redeem all of our trust preferred securities  partially pay for three newly acquired operating properties  acquire a parcel of land that we are developing in a partnership  to repay borrowings on our unsecured revolver  and for general corporate purposes 
cash flow provided by operations increased slightly when comparing to the increase was primarily due to the increase in construction receivables net of the increase in construction payables and the increase in share based compensation 
the increase in construction activity was due to our subsidiary  merit  commencing several construction projects during merit records its revenues and related expenses based on the percentage of completion method and as such records receivables and payables as part of the estimate of the amounts completed 
cash flow provided by operations increased during compared to primarily due to changes in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
these changes were primarily the result of an increase in the fair value of deferred compensation  the payment of real estate taxes in related to the sale of properties and the payment of other liabilities in related to funds held for managed properties and our exit from the affordable housing management business 
shelf availability 
we have a shelf registration statement that became effective in june this registration statement relates to possible offerings  from time to time  of debt securities including convertible debt  preferred shares  depositary shares  common shares and common share warrants 
this registration statement will expire in june in january  we issued million of new common shares under our prior registration statement that was dated may and was scheduled to expire may in may  we issued million of new common shares under our prior registration statement 
after these two offerings the amount available had been reduced to million 
therefore  we decided to file a new registration statement  which increased the availability to million 
in october we issued million of new common shares under this current registration statement 
securities and or debt offerings up to million are available under this shelf registration statement  after giving effect to the october common share offering 
additionally  effective august   we registered a continuous offering program  where we can sell up to million of our common shares in open market transactions at the then market price per share 
as of the date of this filing no shares have been sold under this program 
liquidity normal business operations 
we anticipate that we will meet our normal business operations and liquidity requirements for the upcoming year generally through net cash provided by operations 
we believe that if net cash provided by operations is below projections  other sources  such as the unsecured revolver  secured and unsecured borrowings are or can be made available and should be sufficient to meet our normal business operations and liquidity requirements 
liquidity non operational activities 
sources of cash available for repayment of debt  any property acquisitions and funding other capital expenditures are expected to be provided primarily by proceeds from the refinancing of debt borrowings  our unsecured revolver  the sale of properties  and possibly the sale of common shares 
the partnership in which we are a partner  is developing a unit apartment project that is expected to be completed during we anticipate financing the construction costs through a construction loan which the partnership has already obtained

property revenue is impacted by a combination of rental rates  rent concessions and occupancy levels  ie  net collected rent per unit 
physical occupancy at the end of each period and net collected rent per unit are presented in the following tables physical occupancy for the year ended december  same community properties midwest mid atlantic southeast total same community acquired properties n a n a development n a n a average monthly net collected rent per unit for the year ended december  same community properties midwest mid atlantic southeast total same community acquired properties n a n a development n a n a property revenue increased in compared to primarily as a result of an increase of million contributed by the acquired and development properties 
property revenue for the same community properties increased million primarily due to an increase in net rents potential rent less concessions and a decline in the amount of vacancy losses 
the majority of the improvement was in the southeast portfolio 
property revenues remained consistent when comparing to fees  reimbursements and other 
the management and service company revenues fees  reimbursements and others declined  when comparing to effective during our remaining property and asset management contracts were terminated 
therefore  we will no longer be reporting management fee revenue 
the decline when comparing to was due to the termination of a large third party management contract during property operating and maintenance expenses 
property operating and maintenance expenses increased million when comparing to this increase was primarily due to property operating and maintenance expenses for the acquired development properties being million in compared to zero for property operating and maintenance expenses remained relatively flat for the same community properties in compared to depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased million when comparing to this increase was primarily due to an increase of approximately million in depreciation due to the acquisition development properties and an increase of million in amortization of intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquired properties 
the intangible assets are being amortized over a to month period 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased in compared to primarily as a result of the amortization of the intangible assets recorded in connection with the properties acquired in having their amortization being completed amortized during direct property management and service company expenses 
direct property management and service company expenses decreased in compared to due to the termination of all property and asset management contracts and in compared to as a result of the reduction in the number of properties managed for third party owners 
construction and other services 
our subsidiary  merit  is engaged as a general contractor and construction manager which acts as our in house construction division as well as provides general contracting and construction management services to third parties 
merit intends to concentrate its efforts on rehabilitation and ground up construction projects  primarily for multifamily housing projects 
during merit worked on ten projects for third parties  five of which have been completed 
additionally  merit completed the rehabilitation of one of our properties and is currently constructing a unit property for a partnership in which we are a partner  as described above 
merit records revenue and related expenses on the percentage of completion method 
also  in accordance with the rules of consolidation  revenue and related expenses for the rehabilitation project that merit completed for us and the construction of the unit project that merit is currently working on are eliminated in consolidation 
the revenue and expenses shown for represent construction services for third parties  while the revenue and expenses shown for were from third party painting services that merit provided at that time but has since ceased providing 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million when comparing to this increase was primarily due to an increase in adjustments to various payroll and incentive compensation accruals  including a one time charge of approximately  related to the resignation of our former vice president and general counsel  net of a decline in directors deferred compensation expense 
prior to january   the fair value of the directors deferred compensation was adjusted based upon the closing price of our common shares at the end of each period 
effective january  this plan was modified to provide that all distributions under the plan will be in the form of our common shares instead of cash 
as a result  the fair value of the deferred compensation is no longer adjusted based upon the closing price of our common shares 
there were no significant variances when comparing to interest expense 
interest expense decreased million when comparing to the decrease was primarily due to mortgage loan interest expense declining million due to a reduction in mortgage loans of million during additionally  on june  we redeemed all of our trust preferred securities  which resulted in a reduction in interest expense of million 
in connection with the original issuance of the trust preferred securities we incurred issuance costs that were recorded as other assets and subsequently charged to interest expense each period over the life of the securities 
we recognized the remaining balance of  of issuance costs as a one time non cash charge to interest expense in additionally  the average interest rate dropped to at december  from at december  interest expense decreased million in compared to primarily due to the receipt in the first quarter of of refunds totaling  of defeasance costs in connection with certain previously defeased loans and decreased interest expense of  for borrowings on our revolver as well as a reduction in mortgage loans of million during gain on insurance recoveries 
during we settled a wind storm damage claim at one of our central ohio properties for the aggregate sum of  which is net of our deductible 
during  we settled a wind storm damage claim involving of our central ohio properties for the aggregate sum of  net of our deductible 
also included in this category for was a settlement of  net of our deductible in connection with a clubhouse fire at one of our ohio properties 
the gain on insurance recoveries recorded in and represent insurance proceeds received or to be received in amounts greater than the depreciated carrying book value of the assets written off and costs incurred to make repairs a total of zero in and  in 
equity in net income of joint ventures 
on december   the joint venture in which we were a partner sold the affordable housing property that it owned 
our proportionate share of the gain recognized in was million 
income from discontinued operations 
included in discontinued operations for the years ended december  and  are the operating results and the gains related to two wholly owned properties that were sold in  and wholly owned properties that were sold in the operating loss from discontinued operations in was primarily due to costs incurred to defease loans that were secured by properties that were sold 
there were no discontinued operations in as we did not dispose of any properties 
for further details on income from discontinued operations  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k 
preferred share repurchase costs 
on june   we redeemed all of our class b series ii cumulative redeemable preferred shares at a cost of approximately million  plus accrued and unpaid dividends through the redemption date 
in connection with the issuance of the class b preferred shares in december  we incurred approximately million in issuance costs and recorded such costs as a reduction to shareholders equity 
we recognized the million of issuance costs as a reduction in net earnings in computing our net loss income applicable to common shares for the year ended december discount on preferred share repurchase 
in  we repurchased  of our preferred depositary shares  which each represent th of a share of our class b series ii cumulative redeemable preferred shares 
the depositary shares have a recorded value of per share 
the average price that we paid per share for the repurchases was  and we therefore recognized a total discount of million 
inflation 
we believe that the effects of inflation only minimally impacts our operational performance because our leases are mostly for month terms  which allows us the opportunity to increase our new lease and lease renewal rents to account for inflationary price increases 
we are careful to account for inflationary factors when entering into guaranteed maximum price contracts for third party construction services  however  there can be no assurance that inflation will not have a material adverse impact upon the profitability of our construction services subsidiary in future periods 
see item a risk factors 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements include accounts of all subsidiaries  the two reit subsidiaries  the operating partnership structured as a downreit and the joint venture partnership in which we are a partner 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these consolidated financial statements  we have utilized information available including industry practice and our own past history in forming estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the consolidated financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
it is possible that the ultimate outcome that we anticipated in formulating the estimates inherent in these consolidated financial statements may not materialize 
as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates that may impact comparability of our results of operations to those of other companies in similar businesses 
the company has identified five significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the five critical accounting policies are construction services 
we account for general contracting and construction management services that we provide to third parties using the percentage completion method 
under this method  the amount of revenue and expense to be recognized for each project that we are engaged in at the end of each reporting period is estimated based on the percentage of work completed on that date 
the use of judgment and or estimates is required in determining the percentage of work completed  the expected total cost of a project in process  and in certain circumstances the total amount of revenue for a project in process 
if we had used different estimates  different amounts would have been recognized in revenue and expense which may have resulted in a material impact to our results of operations 
if actual costs or revenue differ from estimates  it may require us to make a material adjustment to our results of operations 
impairment of long lived assets 
we assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
in performing this analysis  we estimate holding periods of the assets  changes in fair market value of the assets and cash flows related to the operations of the assets to determine the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives under consideration by management 
should the estimates used to determine alternatives or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
we review goodwill annually and whenever there is an impairment indicator 
in performing this analysis  we use a multiple of revenues to the range of potential alternatives and assign a probability to the various alternatives we consider 
should estimates used to determine the alternatives considered or the probabilities of the occurrence thereof change  impairment may result which could materially impact our results of operations 
share based compensation 
we estimate the fair value of share based compensation awarded 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of the stock options  and the monte carlo method to estimate the fair value of restricted share awards in which the number of shares that will ultimately vest are subject to market conditions 
the use of judgment and or estimates is required in determining certain of the assumptions used by these valuation models  such as volatility of share prices and forfeitures of awards 
if we had used different judgment and or estimates  different valuations would have been produced that may have resulted in a material change to our results of operations 
we also estimate future performance results related to certain share based awards 
if the results vary from our estimate  it may require us to make a material adjustment to our results of operations 
real estate taxes 
we estimate the amount of real estate taxes for which we will be liable based upon assumptions relating to possible changes in millage rates and property value reassessments 
in most circumstances  the actual millage rates or reassessment values are not available until the following reporting period and consequently these rates or values could differ from assumptions and require material adjustments to the liabilities recorded 
acquisitions of investment properties 
the company allocates the purchase price of properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets acquired based on their fair values 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  the company utilizes a number of sources  including independent appraisals that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of the respective property  our own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in our portfolio and other market data 
the company also considers information obtained about each property as a result of its pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
based on our variable rate debt outstanding at december   an interest rate change of basis points would impact interest expense by approximately million on an annual basis 
additionally  we have interest rate risk associated with fixed rate debt at maturity 
we have managed  and will continue to manage  interest rate risk as follows i maintain what we believe to be a conservative ratio of fixed rate  long term debt to total debt such that variable rate exposure is kept at an acceptable level  ii consider hedges for certain long term variable and or fixed rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps or interest rate caps  and iii consider the use of treasury locks where appropriate to hedge rates on anticipated debt transactions 
we use various financial models and advisors to assist us in analyzing opportunities to achieve those objectives 
for additional information related to interest rate hedge agreements  see derivative instruments and hedging activities in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements presented in part ii  item of this report on form k

we further intend to prepay the remaining million maturing debt at par on march  our unsecured revolving credit facility had a weighted average interest rate of at december  this facility has a three year term with an initial maturity in october  however  there is a provision for a one year extension at our option 
contingencies environmental 
we have reviewed tangible long lived assets and other agreements for associated asset retirement obligations aros and have determined that we do not have any material aros that would require recognition as a liability or disclosure in our financial statements at december  phase i environmental audits were obtained at the time of the ipo  property acquisition or property refinancing  as the case may be  on all of our wholly owned properties 
future claims for environmental liabilities are not measurable given the uncertainties surrounding whether there exists a basis for any such claims to be asserted and  if so  whether any claims will  in fact  be asserted
