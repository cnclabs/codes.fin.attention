item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview general we are a global consulting firm focusing on providing human capital and financial consulting services 
in the short term  our revenue is driven by many factors  including the general state of the global economy and the resulting level of discretionary spending  the continuing regulatory compliance requirements of our clients  changes in investment markets  the ability of our consultants to attract new clients or provide additional services to existing clients  the impact of new regulations in the legal and accounting fields and the impact of our ongoing cost saving initiatives 
in the long term  we expect that our financial results will depend in large part upon how well we succeed in deepening our existing client relationships through thought leadership and a focus on developing cross practice solutions  actively pursuing new clients in our target markets  cross selling and making strategic acquisitions 
we believe that the highly fragmented industry in which we operate offers us growth opportunities  because we provide a unique business combination of benefits and human capital consulting  as well as risk and capital management and strategic technology solutions 
segments we provide services in three business segments benefits  risk and financial services and talent and rewards 
benefits segment 
the benefits segment is our largest and most established segment 
this segment has grown through business combinations as well as strong organic growth 
it helps clients create and manage cost effective benefits programs that help them attract  retain and motivate a talented workforce 
the benefits segment provides benefits consulting and administration services through four primary lines of business retirement  health and group benefits  technology and administration solutions  and international consulting 
retirement supports organizations worldwide in designing  managing  administering and communicating all types of retirement plans 
health and group benefits provides advice on the strategy  design  financing  delivery  ongoing plan management and communication of health and group benefit programs 
through our technology and administration solutions line of business  we deliver cost effective benefit outsourcing solutions 
the international consulting group provides expertise in dealing with international human capital management and related benefits and compensation advice for corporate headquarters and their subsidiaries 
a significant portion of the revenue in this segment is from recurring work  driven in large part by the heavily regulated nature of employee benefits plans and our clients annual needs for these services 
for the fiscal year ended june   the benefits segment contributed of our segment revenue 
for the same period  approximately of the benefits segment s revenue originates from outside the united states and is thus subject to translation exposure resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
risk and financial services segment 
within the risk and financial services segment  our second largest segment  we have three primary lines of business risk consulting and software rcs  investment consulting and solutions investment  and reinsurance and insurance brokerage brokerage 
the risk and financial services segment accounted for of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  approximately of the segment s revenue originates from outside the united states and is thus subject to translation exposure resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the segment has a strong base of recurring revenue  driven by long term client relationships in reinsurance brokerage services  retainer investment consulting relationships  consulting services on financial reporting  and actuarial opinions on property casualty loss reserves 
some of these relationships have been in place for more than years 
a portion of the revenue is related to project work  which is more heavily dependent on the overall level of discretionary spending by clients 
this work is favorably influenced by strong client relationships  particularly related to mergers and acquisitions consulting 

table of contents major revenue growth drivers include changes in regulations  the level of mergers and acquisitions activity in the insurance industry  growth in pension and other asset pools  and reinsurance retention and pricing trends 
talent and rewards segment 
our third largest segment  talent and rewards  is focused on three primary lines of business executive compensation  rewards  talent and communication  and data  surveys and technology 
the talent and rewards segment accounted for approximately of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  few of the segment s projects have a recurring element 
as a result  this segment is most sensitive to changes in discretionary spending due to cyclical economic fluctuations 
approximately of the segment s revenue originates from outside the united states and is thus subject to translation exposure resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
revenue for talent and rewards consulting has minimal seasonality  with a small degree of heightened activity in the second half of the year during the annual compensation  benefits and survey cycles 
major revenue growth drivers in this group include demand for workforce productivity improvements and labor cost reductions  focus on high performance culture  globalization of the workforce  changes in regulations and benefits programs  mergers and acquisitions activity  and the demand for universal metrics related to workforce engagement 
financial statement overview towers watson s fiscal year ends june shown below are towers watson s top five markets based on percentage of consolidated revenue 
the fiscal years ended june  and include data of towers watson s geographic regions 
the fiscal year ended june  includes only data of historical watson wyatt s geographic regions 
fiscal year geographic region united states united kingdom canada germany netherlands we derive the majority of our revenue from fees for consulting services  which generally are billed at standard hourly rates and expense reimbursement  which we refer to as time and expense  or on a fixed fee basis 
management believes the approximate percentages for time and expense and fixed fee basis engagements are and  respectively 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis with revenue generally recognized as services are performed 
no single client accounted for more than of our consolidated revenues for any of our most recent three fiscal years 
our most significant expense is compensation to associates  which typically comprises approximately of total costs of providing services 
we compensate our directors and select executives with incentive stock based compensation plans from time to time 
when granted  awards are governed by the towers watson co 
long term incentive plan  which provides for the awards to be valued at their grant date fair value which is amortized over the expected term of the awards  generally three years 
in connection with the issuance of towers watson restricted class a common stock to towers perrin rsu holders in the merger  we expect the total non cash compensation expense relating to towers watson restricted class a common stock for the three year period to be million 
this estimate was determined assuming a annual forfeiture rate based on actual and expected attrition and the graded method of expense methodology 
this expense methodology assumes that the restricted shares were issued to towers perrin rsu holders in equal amounts of shares that vest over one year  two years and three years giving the effect of more expense in the first year than the second and third 
in the event that an associate is involuntarily terminated other than for cause  vesting is accelerated and expense is recorded immediately 
salaries and employee benefits are comprised of wages paid to associates  related taxes  severance  benefit expenses such as pension  medical and insurance costs  and fiscal year end incentive bonuses 
professional and subcontracted services represent fees paid to external service providers for employment  marketing and other services 
for the three most recent fiscal years  approximately to of the professional and subcontracted services were directly incurred on behalf of clients and were reimbursed by them  with such reimbursements being included in revenue 
for the fiscal year 
table of contents ended june  for towers watson  approximately of professional and subcontracted services represent these reimbursable services 
occupancy includes expenses for rent and utilities 
general and administrative expenses include legal  marketing  human resources  finance  research  technology support  supplies  telephone and other costs to operate office locations as well as professional fees and insurance  including premiums on excess insurance and losses on professional liability claims  non client reimbursed travel by associates  publications and professional development 
this line item also includes miscellaneous expenses  including gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
depreciation and amortization includes the depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets and internally developed software 
transaction and integration expenses include fees and charges associated with the merger and with our other acquisitions 
transaction and integration expenses principally consist of investment banker fees  regulatory filing expenses  integration consultants  as well as legal  accounting  marketing  and information technology integration expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are continually evaluated based on available information and experience 
because of the use of estimates inherent in the financial reporting process  actual results could differ from those estimates 
the areas that we believe are critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients  discretionary compensation  income taxes  pension assumptions  incurred but not reported claims  and goodwill and intangible assets 
the critical accounting policies discussed below involve making difficult  subjective or complex accounting estimates that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate or assumption 
different estimates that we could have used  or changes in estimates that are reasonably likely to occur  may have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue includes fees primarily generated from consulting services provided 
we recognize revenue from these consulting engagements when hours are worked  either on a time and expense basis or on a fixed fee basis  depending on the terms and conditions defined at the inception of an engagement with a client 
we have engagement letters with our clients that specify the terms and conditions upon which the engagements are based 
these terms and conditions can only be changed upon agreement by both parties 
individual associates billing rates are principally based on a multiple of salary and compensation costs 
revenue for fixed fee arrangements that span multiple months is based upon the percentage of completion method 
we typically have three types of fixed fee arrangements annual recurring projects  projects of a short duration  and non recurring system projects 
annual recurring projects and the projects of short duration are typically straightforward and highly predictable in nature 
as a result  the project manager and financial staff are able to identify  as the project status is reviewed and bills are prepared monthly  the occasions when cost overruns could lead to the recording of a loss accrual 
we have non recurring system projects that are longer in duration and subject to more changes in scope as the project progresses 
we evaluate at least quarterly  and more often as needed  project managers estimates to complete to assure that the projects current statuses are accounted for properly 
certain software contracts generally provide that if the client terminates a contract  we are entitled to payment for services performed through termination 
revenue recognition for fixed fee engagements is affected by a number of factors that change the estimated amount of work required to complete the project such as changes in scope  the staffing on the engagement and or the level of client participation 
the periodic engagement evaluations require us to make judgments and estimates regarding the overall profitability and stage of project completion that  in turn  affect how we recognize revenue 
we recognize a loss on an engagement when estimated revenue to be received for that engagement is less than the total estimated direct and indirect costs associated with the engagement 
losses are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we have experienced certain costs in excess of estimates from time to time 
management believes it is rare  however  for these excess costs to result in overall project losses 

table of contents we have developed various software programs and technologies that we provide to clients in connection with consulting services 
in most instances  such software is hosted and maintained by us and ownership of the technology and rights to the related code remain with us 
software developed to be utilized in providing services to a client  but for which the client does not have the contractual right to take possession  is capitalized during the implementation stage 
revenue associated with the related contract  together with amortization of the related capitalized software  is recognized over the service period 
as a result  we do not recognize revenue during the implementation phase of an engagement 
in connection with the merger  we acquired the reinsurance brokerage business of towers perrin 
in our capacity as a reinsurance broker  we collect premiums from reinsureds and  after deducting our brokerage commissions  we remit the premiums to the respective reinsurance underwriters on behalf of reinsureds 
in general  compensation for reinsurance brokerage services is earned on a commission basis 
commissions are calculated as a percentage of a reinsurance premium as stipulated in the reinsurance contracts with our clients and reinsurers 
we recognize brokerage services revenue on the later of the inception date or billing date of the contract 
in addition  we hold cash needed to settle amounts due reinsurers or reinsureds  net of any commissions due to us  pending remittance to the ultimate recipient 
we are permitted to invest these funds in high quality liquid instruments 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable 
cash collections and invoices generated in excess of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred revenue until the revenue recognition criteria are met 
client reimbursable expenses  including those relating to travel  other out of pocket expenses and any third party costs  are included in revenue  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses are included in professional and subcontracted services as a cost of revenue 
valuation of billed and unbilled receivables from clients we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the clients failure to pay for the services after the services have been rendered  including allowances when customer disputes may exist 
the related provision is recorded as a reduction to revenue 
our allowance policy is based on the aging of the billed and unbilled client receivables and has been developed based on the write off history 
facts and circumstances such as the average length of time the receivables are past due  general market conditions  current economic trends and our clients ability to pay may cause fluctuations in our valuation of billed and unbilled receivables 
discretionary compensation our compensation program includes a discretionary bonus that is determined by management and has historically been paid once per fiscal year in the form of cash and or deferred stock units after our annual operating results are finalized 
as a result of the merger  interim bonuses were paid in march relating to the period ended december  and were also paid september relating to the six month period ended june   after which time bonuses are expected to be paid annually each september 
an estimated annual bonus amount is initially developed at the beginning of each fiscal year in conjunction with our budgeting process 
estimated annual operating performance is reviewed quarterly and the discretionary annual bonus amount is then adjusted  if necessary  by management to reflect changes in the forecast of pre bonus profitability for the year 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards codification asc  income taxes  which prescribes the use of the asset and liability approach to the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities related to the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or income tax returns 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a portion or all of a given deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in accordance with asc  income tax expense includes i deferred tax expense  which generally represents the net change in the deferred tax asset or liability balance during the year plus any change in valuation allowances and ii current tax expense  which represents the amount of tax currently payable to or receivable from a taxing authority plus amounts accrued for expected tax contingencies including both tax and interest 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not  and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return  in order for those positions to be recognized in the financial statements 
we continually review tax laws  regulations and related guidance in order to properly record any uncertain tax positions 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the outcome of tax audits 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate 

table of contents incurred but not reported ibnr claims we accrue for ibnr professional liability claims that are probable and estimable  and for which we have not yet contracted for insurance coverage 
we use actuarial assumptions to estimate and record a liability for ibnr professional liability claims 
our estimated ibnr liability is based on long term trends and averages  and considers a number of factors  including changes in claim reporting patterns  claim settlement patterns  judicial decisions  and legislation and economic decisions 
our estimated ibnr liability does not include actuarial projections for the effect of claims data for large cases due to the insufficiency of actuarial experience with such cases 
our estimated ibnr liability will fluctuate if claims experience changes over time 
our ibnr liability was million and million as of june  and  respectively 
to the extent our captive insurance companies  pcic and smic  expect losses to be covered by a third party they record a receivable for the amount expected to be recovered 
this receivable is classified in other current or other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
pension assumptions we sponsor both qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans and other post retirement benefit plan or opeb plans in north america and europe 
these plans represented of our total pension obligations as of june  we also sponsor funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans in certain other countries representing the remaining of the liability 
under the legacy watson wyatt plans in north america  benefits are based on the number of years of service and the associate s compensation during the five highest paid consecutive years of service 
the non qualified plan  included only in north america  provides for pension benefits that would be covered under the qualified plan but are limited by the internal revenue code 
the non qualified plan has no assets and therefore is an unfunded arrangement 
beginning january  watson wyatt made changes to the plan in the united kingdom related to years of service used in calculating benefits for associates 
benefits earned prior to january are based on the number of years of service and the associate s compensation during the three years before leaving the plan and benefits earned after january are based on the number of years of service and the associate s average compensation during the associate s term of service since that date 
the plan liabilities in germany were a result of watson wyatt s acquisition of heissmann gmbh in a significant percentage of the liabilities represent the grandfathered pension benefit for associates hired prior to a july plan amendment 
the pension plan for those hired after july is a defined contribution type arrangement 
in the netherlands  the pension benefit is a percentage of service and average salary over the working life of the associate  where salary includes allowances and bonuses up to a set maximum salary and is offset by the current social security benefit 
the benefit liability is reflected on the balance sheet 
the measurement date for each of the plans is june the legacy towers perrin pension plans in the united states accrue benefits under a cash balance formula for associates hired or rehired after and for all associates for service after for associates hired prior to and active as of january  benefits prior to are based on a combination of a cash balance formula  for the period after  and a final average pay formula based on years of plan service and the highest five consecutive years of plan compensation prior to under the cash balance formula benefits are based on a percentage of each year of the associate s plan compensation 
the canadian retirement plan provides a choice of a defined benefit approach or a defined contribution approach 
the non qualified plans in north america provide for pension benefits that would be covered under the qualified plan in the respective country but are limited by statutory maximums 
the non qualified plans have no assets and therefore are unfunded arrangements 
the uk plan provides predominantly lump sum benefits 
benefit accruals under the uk plan ceased on march  the plans in germany mostly provide benefits under a cash balance benefit formula 
benefits under the netherlands plan accrue on a final pay basis on earnings up to a maximum amount each year 
the benefit assets and liabilities are reflected on the balance sheet 
the measurement date for each of the plans has historically been december  but has been changed to june as a result of the merger 
the determination of our pension benefit obligations and related benefit expense under the plans is based on a number of assumptions that  given the longevity of the plans  are long term in focus 
a change in one or a combination of these assumptions could have a material impact on our pension benefit obligation and related expense 
for this reason  management employs a long term view so that assumptions do not change frequently in response to short term volatility in the economy 
any difference between actual and assumed results is amortized into our pension expense over the average remaining service period of participating associates 
we consider several factors prior to the start of each fiscal year when determining the appropriate annual assumptions  including economic forecasts  relevant benchmarks  historical trends  portfolio composition and peer comparisons 
the compensation committee of our board of directors approved an amendment to the terms of the existing us qualified and non qualified defined benefit pension plans  postretirement benefit plans and defined contribution plans which was communicated in september effective december   the existing us qualified and non qualified pension plans were frozen to new participants  and benefit accruals will be frozen under the current benefit formulas effective december  new pension benefits will accrue beginning on january  under a new stable value pension design for qualified and non qualified pension plans maintained for us associates  including us named executive officers 
retiree medical benefits provided under our us postretirement benefit plans were frozen to new hires effective january  life insurance benefits under the same plans will be frozen with respect to service  eligibility and amounts as of january  for active associates 
as a result of these changes to the us pension and post retirement benefit plans  there were remeasurements of the legacy watson wyatt us plans and the legacy 
table of contents towers perrin post retirement benefit plan as of september  the legacy towers perrin pension plan was not required to be remeasured due to the plan design 
assumptions used in the valuations of the defined benefit pension plans the following assumptions were used in the valuations of towers watson s defined benefit pension plans 
the assumptions presented for the north american plans represent the weighted average of rates for all us and canadian plans 
the assumptions presented for towers watson s european plans represent the weighted average of rates for the uk  germany and netherlands plans 
in relation to the acquisition of towers perrin on january   the legacy plans of towers perrin have been included in the assumptions as of and for the years ended june  and the assumptions as of and for the year ended june  represent only the legacy watson wyatt plans 
the assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the fiscal years ended june   and were as follows year ended june  north north north america europe america europe america europe discount rate expected long term rate of return on assets rate of increase in compensation levels the following table presents the assumptions used in the valuation to determine the projected benefit obligation for the fiscal years ended june  and june  june  north north america europe america europe discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels for the fiscal year  the discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost was initially based on the rates in the table shown above for the determination of the projected benefit obligation as of june   which included a rate for north america 
as a result of plan changes adopted during the first quarter of fiscal year  the legacy watson wyatt us pension plans were remeasured as of september  upon remeasurement the discount rate assumption was changed for these plans and the net periodic benefit cost for the fiscal year is now calculated using a weighted average discount rate of for north america 
towers watson s discount rate assumptions were determined by matching expected future pension benefit payments with current aa corporate bond yields from the respective countries for the same periods 
in the united states  specific bonds were selected to match plan cash flows 
in canada  yields were taken from a corporate bond yield curve 
in europe  the discount rate was set based on yields on european aa corporate bonds at the measurement date 
the expected rates of return assumptions at and per annum for north america and europe  respectively  were supported by an analysis performed by towers watson of the weighted average yield expected to be achieved with the anticipated makeup of investments 
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the north american pension plans for fiscal year effect on fy change in assumption pre tax pension expense basis point decrease in discount rate million basis point increase in discount rate million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 

table of contents the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for the european pension plans for fiscal year effect on fy change in assumption pre tax pension expense basis point decrease in discount rate million basis point increase in discount rate million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the sensitivities reflect the effect of assumption changes occurring after acquisition accounting has been applied 
the differences in the discount rate and compensation level assumption used for the north american and european plans above can be attributed to the differing interest rate environments associated with the currencies and economies to which the plans are subject 
the differences in the expected return on assets are primarily driven by the respective asset allocation in each plan  coupled with the return expectations for assets in the respective currencies 
goodwill and intangible assets in applying the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisitions  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
intangible assets are initially valued at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of march the fair value of the intangible assets is compared with their carrying value and an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually as of march  and whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the evaluation is a two step process whereby the fair value of the reporting unit is compared with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit  we used valuation techniques that fall under income or market approaches 
under the discounted cash flow method  an income approach  the business enterprise value is determined by discounting to present value the terminal value which is calculated using debt free after tax cash flows for a finite period of years 
key estimates in this approach are internal financial projection estimates prepared by management  business risk  and expected rate of return on capital 
the guideline company method  a market approach  develops valuation multiples by comparing our reporting units to similar publicly traded companies 
key estimates and selection of valuation multiples rely on the selection of similar companies  obtaining estimates of forecasted revenue and ebitda estimates for the similar companies and selection of valuation multiples as they apply to the reporting unit characteristics 
under the similar transactions method  a market approach  actual transaction prices and operating data from companies deemed reasonably similar to the reporting units is used to develop valuation multiples as an indication of how much a knowledgeable investor in the marketplace would be willing to pay for the business units 
as the fair value of our reporting units exceeds their carrying value  we do not perform step two to determine the impairment loss 
in the event that a reporting unit s carrying value exceeded its fair value  we would determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit used in step one to all the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit including any recognized or unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination 
then the implied fair value of goodwill would be compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to determine if goodwill is impaired 
for the fiscal year ended june   we did not record any impairment losses of goodwill or intangibles

table of contents statement of operations for the fiscal year ended june  compared to pro forma financial information for the fiscal year ended june  revenue towers watson revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was billion  an increase of million  or  from pro forma revenue of billion for the fiscal year ended june  our revenue growth reflects increased revenue from both new and existing clients 
in addition  revenue from our two new acquisitions  aliquant and emb  contributed to the increase in revenue in the second half of fiscal year we use constant currency to evaluate our results of operations because we are a global company subject to foreign currency translation fluctuations in our year over year comparisons 
constant currency is calculated by translating prior year revenue at the current year average exchange rate 
the average exchange rate used to translate our revenues earned in british pounds sterling was for fiscal  and the average exchange rate used to translate our revenues earned in euros was for fiscal year a comparison of segment revenue for the fiscal year ended june   as compared to the fiscal year ended june  is as follows benefits revenue increased and was billion for fiscal year compared to billion for fiscal year on a constant currency basis  our retirement practice revenue remained consistent  which represents the majority of the segment s revenue 
the growth in the retirement practice is from the developing markets in asia and latin america which is driven by new legislation and client demand 
the retirement practice in north america and europe experienced decreased revenue in fiscal year compared to the same period in fiscal year because of a strong prior year comparable from project work related to regulatory changes 
revenue increased on a constant currency basis in our technology and administration solutions practice  with revenue growth in the us and a slight decline in europe 
growth in the us was largely due to the addition of aliquant  a health and welfare benefits administration outsourcing firm that we acquired during the second quarter of fiscal year revenue increased in our health and group benefits practice as health care reform deadlines approach 
revenue in our benefits segment increased on an organic basis which excludes the effects of acquisitions and currency effects 
risk and financial services revenue increased and was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively

revenue from our brokerage practice decreased on a constant currency basis from decreases in pricing and volume as a result of overall market conditions in the us property and casualty insurance marketplace  which were only partially offset from new client activity in europe

talent and rewards revenue remained consistent and was million and million for the fiscal year ended june  and  respectively

after adjusting for the revenue that was transferred to pay governance and for two small acquisitions in dubai and sweden  talent and rewards experienced constant currency revenue growth 
on an organic basis  revenues in all practices  executive compensation  rewards  talent and communication  and data  surveys and technology  increased 
the organic increase in revenue for executive compensation is due to increased project activity in north america in both management and compensation committee consulting and strong growth in asia pacific 
increases in revenue in asia pacific  particularly china  is attributed to local companies expanding nationally  regionally and globally and implement executive pay plans to support growth 
organic revenue growth in reward  talent and communication was due to significant increases in all geographic regions especially in asia 
we also experienced organic revenue growth in our data  surveys and technology practice due to growth in data and surveys in all geographic regions  especially in asia

table of contents historical results of towers watson the following sections of management s discussion and analysis are based on actual results of the business and do not contain pro forma information 
liquidity and capital resources our most significant sources of liquidity are funds generated by operating activities  available cash and cash equivalents  and our credit facilities 
consistent with our liquidity position  management considers various alternative strategic uses of cash reserves including acquisitions  dividends and stock buybacks  or any combination of these options 
we believe that we have sufficient resources to fund operations beyond the next months  including million payable in march in principal and interest on the notes issued in connection with the tender offer we completed in june the key variables that we manage in response to current and projected capital resource needs include credit facilities and short term borrowing arrangements  working capital and our stock repurchase program 
our cash and cash equivalents at june  totaled million  compared to million at june  the increase in cash from june  to june  was principally attributable to cash flows from operations including an increase in net income 
our cash and cash equivalents balance includes million from the consolidated balance sheets of pcic and smic  which is available for payment of professional liability claims reserves 
as a result  we have a net million of cash that is available for our use 
our restricted cash at june  totaled million  compared to million at june   of which million is available for payment of reinsurance premiums on behalf of reinsurance clients and an additional million is held for payment of health and welfare premiums on behalf of our clients 
our non us operations are substantially self sufficient for their working capital needs 
as of june   million of towers watson s total cash balance of million was held outside of the united states 
there are no significant repatriation restrictions other than local or us taxes associated with repatriation 
while we currently do not foresee a need to repatriate funds  should we require more capital in the us than is generated by our operations locally  we could elect to repatriate funds held in foreign jurisdictions or raise capital in the us through debt or equity issuances 
these alternatives could result in higher effective tax rates or increased interest expense 
assets and liabilities associated with non us entities have been translated into us dollars as of june   at us dollar rates that fluctuate compared to historical periods 
as a result  cash flows derived from changes in the consolidated balance sheets include the impact of the change in foreign exchange translation rates 
events that could temporarily change the historical cash flow dynamics discussed above include significant changes in operating results  material changes in geographic sources of cash  unexpected adverse impacts from litigation or future pension funding during periods of severe downturn in the capital markets 
cash flows from used in operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities was million for fiscal year compared to cash flows used in operating activities of million for fiscal year this increase of million is primarily attributable to the following a million increase in net income for fiscal year compared to fiscal year  a million increase in cash flows from an increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred income 
the fiscal year comparable period experienced a decrease in cash flows due to the payment of watson wyatt s bonus related to both the fiscal year ended june  and the six months ended december   as well as  towers perrin s bonus related to calendar year december  the allowance for doubtful accounts increased million from june  to june  the number of days of accounts receivable increased to at june  compared to at june  
table of contents cash flows used in investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities for fiscal year were million  compared to million of cash flows from investing activities for fiscal year the decrease is due to million of cash paid for the acquisitions of emb and aliquant in fiscal less million cash acquired in the acquisitions 
cash flows used in financing activities 
cash flows used in financing activities for fiscal year were million  compared to million for fiscal year the decrease was due to million repayment of notes payable  plus interest  in fiscal year capital commitments expenditures of capital were million for fiscal year dividends during the fiscal year ended june   our board of directors approved the payment of a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share 
total dividends paid in fiscal year june  and were million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations remaining payments by fiscal year due as of june  less than more than contractual cash obligations in thousands total year years years years notes payable and accrued interest lease commitments the million is due in march operating leases 
we lease office space under operating lease agreements with terms typically averaging years 
we have determined that there is not a large concentration of leases that will expire in any one fiscal year 
consequently  management anticipates that any increase in future rent expense on leases will be mainly market driven 
intangible assets and liabilities were recognized for the difference between the contractual cash obligations shown above and the estimated market rates at the time of the acquisitions 
the resulting intangibles will amortize to rent expense but do not impact the amounts shown above since there is no change to our contractual cash obligations 
pension contribution 
contributions to our various pension plans for fiscal year are projected to be million 
uncertain tax positions 
the table above does not include liabilities for uncertain tax positions under asc  income taxes 
the settlement period for the million noncurrent portion of the liability cannot be reasonably estimated since it depends on the timing and possible outcomes of tax examinations with various tax authorities 
contingent consideration from acquisitions 
the table above does not include liabilities for contingent consideration for our aliquant and emb acquisitions in fiscal year we expect to pay out approximately million and million in fiscal year and million per year for fiscal year through fiscal year related to these contingent consideration provisions in our agreements and subject to performance requirements on behalf of the sellers

because of the million self insured retention per claim and the additional million aggregate retention above  and because stone mountain is wholly owned by us  our primary errors and omissions risk is self insured 
before the merger  watson wyatt and towers perrin each obtained substantial professional liability insurance from an affiliated captive insurance company  professional consultants insurance company pcic 
a limit of million per claim and in the aggregate was provided by pcic subject to a million per claim self insured retention and coverage was structured substantially similarly to the coverage currently provided by smic 
pcic secured reinsurance of million attaching above the million pcic retained layer 
in addition  both legacy companies carried excess insurance from unaffiliated commercial insurance companies above the self insured retention and the coverage provided by pcic 
before the merger  watson wyatt accounted for its share of pcic s earnings using the equity method 
our ownership interest in pcic is post merger 
as a consequence  pcic s results of operations are consolidated into our results of operations 
although the pcic insurance policies for towers watson s fiscal year continue to cover professional liability claims above a million per claim self insured retention  the consolidation of pcic will effectively net pcic s premium income against our premium expense for the first million of loss above the self insured retention for each legacy company 
accordingly  the impact of pcic s reserve development may result in fluctuations in our earnings 
pcic ceased issuing insurance policies effective july  and at that time entered into a run off mode of operation 
our shareholder agreements with pcic could require additional payments to pcic if development of claims significantly exceeds prior expectations 
if these circumstances were to occur  we would record a liability at the time it becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
we provide for the self insured retention where specific estimated losses and loss expenses for known claims are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
although we maintain professional liability insurance coverage  this insurance does not cover claims made after expiration of our current policies of insurance 
generally accepted accounting principles require that we record a liability for incurred but not reported ibnr professional liability claims if they are probable and reasonably estimable  and for which we have not yet contracted for insurance coverage 
we use actuarial assumptions to estimate and record our ibnr liability 
as of june   we had a million ibnr liability balance 
to the extent our captive insuance companies  pcic and smic  expect losses to be covered by a third party they record a receivable for the amount expected to be recovered 
this receivable is classified in other current or other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet 
as stated above  commencing july   towers watson obtained primary insurance for errors and omissions professional liability risks from smic on a claims made basis 
smic has issued a policy of insurance substantially similar to the policies historically issued by pcic 
insurance market conditions for us and our industry have varied in recent years  but the long term trend has been increasing premium cost 
although the market for insurance is presently robust  trends toward higher self insured retentions  constraints on aggregate excess coverage for this class of professional liability risk and financial difficulties which have  over the past few years  been faced by several longstanding e o carriers are anticipated to recur periodically  and to be reflected in our future annual insurance renewals 
as a result  we will continue to assess our ability to secure future insurance coverage  and we cannot assure that such coverage will continue to be available indefinitely in the event of specific adverse claims experience  adverse loss trends  market capacity constraints or other factors 
in light of increasing litigation worldwide  including litigation against professionals  we have a policy that all client relationships be documented by engagement letters containing specific risk mitigation clauses that were not included in all historical client agreements 
certain contractual provisions designed to mitigate risk may not be legally enforceable in litigation involving breaches of fiduciary duty or certain other alleged errors or omissions  or in certain jurisdictions 
we may incur significant legal expenses in defending against litigation 
with the exception of our brokerage business  nearly of our us and us corporate clients have signed engagement letters including some if not all of our preferred risk mitigation clauses  and processes to maintain that protocol in the united states and the united kingdom  and to complete it elsewhere  are underway 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements adopted asc  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
 requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income 
it also amends certain consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of asc  business combinations 
the provisions also include expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
we adopted these provisions on july  as a result  our non controlling interest of million as of june   which was previously included in other non current liabilities  was reclassified to non controlling interest in total equity 
in addition  our non controlling interest of million for the year ended june   which was previously included in loss income from affiliates  was reclassified to net loss income attributable to non controlling interests in our results of operations 
not yet adopted on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued asu  intangibles goodwill and other topic when to perform step of the goodwill impairment test for reporting units with zero or negative carrying amounts a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  which does not prescribe a specific method of calculating the carrying value of a reporting unit in the performance of step of the goodwill impairment test and requires entities with a zero or negative carrying value to assess  considering qualitative factors such as but not limited to those listed in asc whether it is more likely than not that a goodwill impairment exists 
if an entity concludes that it is more likely than not that an impairment of goodwill exists  the entity must perform step of the goodwill impairment test 
these provisions are effective for impairment tests performed in our fiscal year upon adoption  if any of our reporting units have a zero or negative carrying value  we must assess  on the basis of current facts and circumstances  whether it is more likely than not that an impairment of our goodwill exists 
if so  we would perform step of the goodwill impairment test on the day of adoption and record the impairment charge  if any  as a cumulative effect adjustment through beginning retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  on our financial position or results of operations of adopting this provision 
on june   the fasb issued asu  comprehensive income topic presentation of comprehensive income  which revised the manner in which entities present comprehensive income in their financial statements 
the new guidance removes the presentation options in asc  comprehensive income  and requires entities to report components of comprehensive income in either a continuous statement of comprehensive income or two separate but consecutive statements 
the asu does not change the items that must be reported in other comprehensive income 
for public entities  the amendments are effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  with early adoption permitted 
we are still evaluating the impact of the change in presentation to our consolidated statement of operations and our consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity and will adopt the new presentation in our fiscal filings 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks in the ordinary course of business 
these risks include interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange and translation risk 
interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio in mainly short term securities that are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
foreign currency risk for the fiscal year ended june   of our revenue was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  typically in the local currency of our foreign operations 
these operations also incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency and our primary international operations use the british pound sterling  canadian dollar and the euro 
our international operations are subject to risks typical of international operations  including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be adversely impacted by changes in these or other factors 
at june   a uniform strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease in net income attributable to controlling interests of million  or  
table of contents for the fiscal year ended june  this theoretical calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
this calculation is not indicative of our actual experience in foreign currency transactions 
translation exposure foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated financial position as well as our consolidated results of operations and may adversely impact our financial position as the assets and liabilities of our foreign operations are translated into us dollars in preparing our consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  foreign exchange rate fluctuations may adversely impact our consolidated results of operations as exchange rate fluctuations on transactions denominated in currencies other than our functional currencies result in gains and losses that are reflected in our consolidated statement of operations 
certain of towers watson s foreign brokerage subsidiaries  primarily in the united kingdom  receive revenue in currencies primarily in us dollars that differ from their functional currencies 
to reduce this variability  towers watson uses foreign exchange forward contracts and over the counter options to hedge the foreign exchange risk of the forecasted collections for up to a maximum of two years in the future 
see note  derivative financial instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained on this form k for a further discussion of our foreign currency forwards and their fair market value 
we consolidate our international subsidiaries by converting them into us dollars in accordance with generally acceptable accounting principles of foreign currency translation 
the results of operations and our financial position will fluctuate when there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates
