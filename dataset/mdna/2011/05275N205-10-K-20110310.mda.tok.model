of this annual report on form k 
the business acquired from cyber ventures  inc generates and sells in market consumer automotive purchase requests 
the business acquired from autotropolis  inc  through its autotropolis 
com website  provides new vehicle purchase requests and related products and services directly to dealers and expands our ability to generate revenues from the acquired  incremental traffic through advertising on the autotropolis website 
new products and services during we introduced webleads  which is described in the section of this item entitled products and services other dealer products and services webleads 
approximately percent of our automotive dealers now subscribe to our webleads product 
in an effort to further expand our services to dealers  we launched dealershipjobs 
com at the february national automotive dealers association conference in san francisco 
dealershipjobs 
com was developed to serve automotive dealerships with regard to attracting and hiring personnel across multiple dealership functions eg  sales and service 
the site is comprised of job listings from across the country giving dealers and prospective employees a hub on which to connect 
at present  the site is free to dealers and job seekers  however  we believe that once a degree of scale is achieved from a traffic perspective  we should be able to generate advertising and other revenues from the site 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began packaging data generated from our websites to expand our product offerings to automobile advertisers 
specifically  our data products are designed to assist automobile advertisers in their efforts to accurately profile prospective new car buyers  better target internet advertising campaigns to them and further optimize those campaigns both in terms of media placement and messaging 
website enhancements during  we began a comprehensive redesign of our flagship consumer brand site  autobytel 
com 
the launch of the redesigned autobytel 
com  which is anticipated to occur in june of  reflects the culmination of consumer internet and automotive shopping behavioral research  as well as design and navigational principles which we believe will offer consumers a richer and more customized experience 
the objective of the redesign is centered on a consumer proposition that expands our offerings and serves the entire automotive lifecycle for visitors to our website 
specifically  the new autobytel 
com is intended to enhance our current content and tools for those researching a vehicle purchase while at the same time  through our new mygarage vehicle ownership service  offering specific destinations for consumers to better manage maintenance for their vehicles  shop for competitive insurance pricing  and stay informed of manufacturer recalls and special offers  as well as explore their options given the equity they have in an existing vehicle and financial options for trade ins or private resell 
by expanding autobytel 
com s offerings  our goal is for consumers to interact with our brand on an on going basis rather than only serving their automotive shopping needs every three to seven years 
we believe that this consumer proposition will ultimately enable us to reposition our brand to benefit from greater consumer satisfaction and recommendations  thus increasing our visitor footprint and driving growth across our purchase request  advertising and data products and services 
table of contents increased number of dealers during  we increased the number of dealers in our network by compared to year end dealer count is the sum of the number of dealer franchises subscribing to our new vehicle purchase request programs  the number of dealer franchises and independent dealers subscribing to our used vehicle purchase request program  the number of dealers subscribing to our finance purchase request program  and the number of dealers subscribing to our webleads program  with dealers participating in more than one of these programs counted by the number of programs in which they participate 
operating expenses we initiated expense reduction initiatives in the fourth quarter of that were intended to better align our operating costs with our revenues and leverage operational efficiencies gained through technology and the acquisition of auto cyber 
as a result of these efforts  we believe we will realize million in annualized savings for industry background the internet has been rapidly adopted by consumers engaged in the vehicle purchasing process  primarily because the internet has become the best method to easily find the information necessary to make informed buying decisions 
additionally  the internet has become a primary tool for consumers to begin communicating with local automotive dealers regarding vehicle pricing  availability  options  and financing 
jd power and associates reported in that seventy seven percent of all us new light vehicle consumer buyers have moved to the internet as a primary vehicle research and shopping tool 
in fact  cnw research marketing reported in that during several phases of the purchase process  more in market shoppers considered third par ty websites as their primary source for information  thus  surpassing both television and magazines 
in addition  many dealers and all manufacturers use the internet as an efficient way to reach those consumers through marketing programs 
according to a presentation by jd power associates  us light vehicle sales increased in compared to  or million for from million for the u 
s automotive market is showing signs of recovery as general motors and chrysler reorganized through bankruptcy during and both general motors and ford reported net income for this recovery may result in increased use of the internet for consumers engaged in the vehicle purchasing process and increased submission of purchase requests by consumers in strategy our goal is to garner a larger share of the billions of dollars spent annually by dealers and manufacturers on automotive marketing services 
we plan to achieve this objective through the following principal strategies grow and effectively generate revenues from the traffic on our owned websites 
traffic to our owned websites is obtained through a variety of sources and methods  including direct navigation to our owned websites  natural search search engine optimization or seo  which is the practice of optimizing keywords in website content to drive traffic to a website  paid search search engine marketing  or sem  which is the practice of bidding on keywords on search engines to drive traffic to a website  direct marketing  and partnering with other website publishers that provide links to our websites 
traffic to our owned websites is m onetized primarily though the creation of purchase requests that are delivered to our dealer and manufacturer customers to help them market and sell new and used vehicles  and through the sale of advertising space on our owned websites 
we plan to grow and effectively monetize our owned websites by increasing traffic acquisition activities 
we plan to increase the traffic to our owned websites through enhancements to our owned websites and effective seo and sem traffic acquisition activities 
our goal is that over time  paid traffic such as sem will be balanced by greater visitation from direct navigation and seo  which we expect to result in increased gross profit margins 
enhancing the quality and user experience of our websites 
we continuously make enhancements to our owned websites  including enhancements of the design and functionality of our owned websites 
these enhancements are intended to position our owned websites as comprehensive best in class destinations for automotive purchase research by consumers 
for  the most significant website enhancement planned involves the redesign of our autobytel 
com website as discussed above under the section of this item entitled significant business developments website enhancements 
increasing the conversion rate of visitors to purchase requests on our owned websites 
through increased seo and sem activities and significant content  tools  and user interface enhancements to our websites  we believe we will be able to increase the number of website visits and improve website engagement  and thereby table of contents increase the conversion of page views into purchase requests 
we believe that an increased conversion rate of page views into purchase requests could result in higher revenue per visitor 
increase the quality of our purchase requests 
high quality purchase requests are those purchase requests that result in high transaction ie  purchase closing ratios for our dealer customers 
as of december   approximately of our purchase requests are internally generated purchase requests 
internally generated purchase requests are generally higher quality than other purchase requests and increase the overall quality of our purchase request portfolio 
other purchase requests are of varying quality 
therefore  we plan to continue to develop and maintain strong relationships only with suppliers of other purchase requests that consistently provide high quality purchase requests 
increase purchase request sales to our dealer customers 
sales of purchase requests to our dealer network constitute a significant source of our revenues 
our goal is to increase the number of purchase requests sold to our retail dealer customers by o increasing the quality of the purchase requests sold to our dealers  o increasing the number of purchase requests sold to each of our dealers  o increasing the number of dealers in our dealer network  o providing customizable purchase request programs to meet our dealers unique marketing requirements  o providing additional value added marketing services that help dealers more effectively utilize the internet to market and sell new and used vehicles  and o increasing overall dealer satisfaction by improving all aspects of our services 
increase purchase request sales to existing manufacturer customers 
we have existing relationships with most manufacturers that market their vehicles in the us we sell purchase requests to our manufacturer customers that they in turn provide to their dealers to help them market and sell new and used vehicles 
our goal is to increase our sales to these existing customers primarily by increasing the quality of the purchase requests we deliver to them 
increase advertising revenue 
as traffic to and time spent on our owned websites by consumers increases  we will seek to increase our advertising revenue 
we intend to leverage our relationships with manufacturers and their advertising agencies to garner higher rates for our traditional display advertising 
we also intend to provide new advertising offerings built around the enhancements to our owned websites  including new editorial opportunities and high demand sales event promotions for individual manufacturers 
it is our belief that if the volume of our traffic and performance of the advertisements placed by manufacturers continue to increase as measured by the click through rates and other metrics typically monitored by online marke ters  existing and prospective advertisers will recognize this increased value by agreeing to pay higher premiums for the advertising space available on our owned websites 
finally  our goal is to increase the number of our advertising customers and to expand beyond manufacturers to include non manufacturer advertising customers 
expand our products and services 
we gather significant amounts of data on consumer intent as it relates to purchasing vehicles 
we intend to use these data to create products and services  including direct business database offerings  which we believe will ultimately help manufacturers and dealers market and sell more new and used vehicles 
we believe that there is significant value in these data  and our objective is to generate revenues from this asset in the most effective and efficient ways possible 
acquisitions and strategic alliances 
our goal is to grow and advance our business and we may do so  in part  through acquisitions and strategic alliances 
we continue to review strategic alternatives that may provide opportunities for growth 
we believe that acquisitions and strategic alliances may allow us to increase market share  benefit from advancements in technology  and strengthen our business operations by enhancing our product and service offerings 
our ability to implement the foregoing strategies and plans is subject to risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  there is no assurance that we will successfully implement our strategies and plans

from the console  dealerships can easily contract or expand territories and increase  restrict or block specific model and purchase request web sources  making it much easier to target inventory challenges and focus marketing resources more efficiently 
dealers can manage their purchase r equests as follows purchase request web source segments purchase request sources into five categories research  quote  buying  enthusiast  and portal based on the type of automotive publisher from where the purchase request is coming 
this enables dealers to configure their mix according to their dealership resources and goals along with the actual performance of category of source s 
zip code enables dealers to apply different territories zip codes to each of their models and purchase request sources

make model helps dealers spend their budget more effectively by allowing them to increase the number of purchase requests for hard to move models or  conversely  block or restrict purchase requests by model for those high demand hot models

seasonality our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to unforeseen events affecting the economy and industry in which we operate 
other factors that may adversely affect our quarterly operating results include our purchase request volume  which fluctuates with automotive industry sales volume that has some measure of seasonality 
typically  volume is highest in the spring and summer months  with lower volume in the fall and winter months 
as a result of the effects of seasonality  investors may not be able to predict our annual operating results based on a quarter to quarter comparison of our operating results 
seasonality in the automotive industry is likely to cause fluctuations in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financ ial condition

competition in the automotive related purchase request marketing services and advertising marketplace we compete for dealer and manufacturer customers 
competition with respect to our core purchase request referral programs continued to be impacted by changing industry conditions in we continue to compete with several companies that maintain business models similar to ours  some with greater resources  and competition has increased from larger competitors that traditionally have competed only in the used vehicle market 
dealers continue to invest in their proprietary websites and traffic acquisition activities  and we expect this trend to continue as dealers strive to own and control more purchase request generating assets under their captive brands 
additionally  all major manufacturers that market their vehic les in the us have their own websites that market their vehicles direct to consumers and generate purchase requests for delivery direct to the manufacturers dealers 
we continue to observe new and emerging business models relating to the generation and delivery of purchase requests 
although these emerging models have put pressure on pricing and gross profit margins for our purchase requests  it is still to be determined whether these new and emerging revenue models will take hold 
table of contents in the advertising marketplace  we compete with major internet portals  transaction based websites  automotive vertical companies and numerous lifestyle websites 
we also compete with traditional marketing channels such as print  radio and television 
operations and technology we believe that our future success is significantly dependent upon our ability to continue to deliver high performance  reliable and comprehensive websites  enhance consumer and dealer product and service offerings  maintain the highest levels of information privacy and ensure transactional security 
our websites are hosted at secure third party data center facilities 
these data centers include redundant power infrastructure  redundant network connectivity  fire detection and suppression systems and security systems to prevent unauthorized access 
our network and computer systems are built on industry standard technology 
system enhancements are primarily intended to accommodate increased traffic across our websites  improve the speed in which purchase requests are processed and introduce new and enhanced products and services 
system enhancements entail the implementation of sophisticated new technology and system processes 
we plan to continue to make investments in technology as we believe appropriate

risk factors in addition to the factors discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section of part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this annual report on form k  the following additional factors may affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the risks described below are not the only risks facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
except for fiscal years and  we have had a history of net annual losses 
we may not be profitable in the future 
if we are unable to achieve profitability in the future and we continue to lose money  our operations will not be financially viable 
except for fiscal years and we have experienced net annual losses  and as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may not be able to achieve profitability in the future 
our potential for future profitability must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in rapidly evolving markets  such as the market for internet commerce 
we believe that to achieve and sustain profitability  we must  among other things continue to send new and used automotive purchase requests to dealers that result in sufficient dealer vehicle sales to justify our fees  expand the number of dealers in our networks and increase the number of purchase requests delivered to dealers  sustain and expand our relationships with manufacturers  increase the volume of purchase requests that originate on our websites  expand purchase request referral sales to other automotive related markets  assure continued access to a high volume of high quality purchase requests at acceptable prices from third party sources  maintain a high degree of customer satisfaction  provide secure and easy to use websites with relevant and quality content for consumers  increase visibility of our brand names  defend and enforce our intellectual property rights  continue to attract  train  retain and motivate qualified personnel  and continue to upgrade and enhance our technologies to accommodate expanded product and service offerings and increased consumer traffic 
we cannot be certain that we will be successful in achieving these goals or that if we are successful in achieving these goals  that we will be profitable in the future 
we are affected by general economic conditions and  in particular  conditions in the automotive industry 
general economic conditions  specifically including the adverse effect of high unemployment on the number of vehicle purchasers and the lack of available consumer credit to finance vehicle purchases have affected the automotive industry  which is currently experiencing what is considered to be the most challenging environment of the past several decades north american vehicle sales stabilized in from levels  but us light vehicle sales remain at lower levels compared to years prior to unemployment levels remain a risk through  fuel prices have been rising and may continue to rise in table of contents our strategy is dependent on increasing purchase request revenue  should dealer attrition occur in our network it could impact purchase request revenue and the number of purchase requests 
our strategy and achievement of profitability are dependent on our ability to increase purchase request revenue 
if we are not successful in increasing purchase request revenue  then we may not be able to achieve profitability in the future 
increasing purchase request revenue is dependent upon our ability to attract and retain qualified dealers and manufacturers as well as expand the number of purchase requests we sell to our dealers and manufacturers 
we derive a majority of our revenue from purchase request fees paid by dealers and manufacturers participating in our programs 
although in and we experienced attrition in the number of our dealers  we halted this attrition during and ended the year with more dealers compared to that number of dealers at year end the number of manufacturers participating in our programs also increased during compared to in addition  we delivered more purchase requests during than if dealer attrition were to occur again and we were unable to add new dealers to mitigate the attrition  our revenues might again decrease 
were dealer attrition or reductions in the number of purchase requests sold to occur again  we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to reduce the level of dealer attrition or increase the number of purchase requests sold  and our failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if manufacturers or dealers require us to decrease the fees we charge for our services  our revenues will decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if any of our advertising relationships with manufacturers terminate  our advertising rates decrease  or we are unable to develop additional advertising customers  our revenues will decrease 
we depend on automotive manufacturers for substantially all of our advertising revenues 
the termination of any of these relationships  a decline in the level of advertising with us  reductions in advertising rates or any significant failure to develop additional sources of advertising would cause our revenues to decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we periodically negotiate revisions to existing agreements and these revisions could decrease our advertising revenues in future periods 
a number of our advertising agreements with manufacturers may be terminated without cause 
we may not be able to maintain our relationship with manufacturers on favorable terms or find alternative comparable relationships capable of replacing advertising revenues on terms satisfa ctory to us 
if we cannot do so  our revenues would decline  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if manufacturers are subject to product recalls or other business interruption  our revenues may decrease and our business could suffer 
manufacturers are periodically subject to product recalls 
product recalls may result in a decline in purchase request requests by our dealers affected by the recalls  including the elimination of purchase requests for certain vehicle models or the cancellation of the purchase request program with us 
if we cannot replace these purchase request sales with purchase request sales to other customers  our results of operations or financial condition will be materially and adversely impacted 
concentration of credit risk and risks due to significant customers 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  investments and accounts receivable 
cash and cash equivalents are primarily maintained with two financial institutions in the united states 
deposits held by banks that exceed the amount of insurance provided for such deposits 
generally these deposits may be redeemed upon demand 
accounts receivable are primarily derived from fees billed to automotive dealers and manufacturers 
we have a concentration of credit risk with our automotive industry related accounts receivable balances  and in particular with two manufacturers general motors and nissan 
during approximately of the company s total revenues were derived from these manufacturers  and approximately of its total gross accounts re ceivable are receivable from them at december  no collateral is required to support our accounts receivables and we maintain an allowance for bad debts for potential credit losses 
if there is a decline in the general economic environment that negatively affects the financial condition of our customers or an increase in the number of customers that are dissatisfied with their services  additional estimated allowances for bad debts and customer credits may be required and the impact on the our business  results of operations or financial condition could be material 
competition could adversely affect our market share  pricing  cost structure and purchase request supply 
the success we achieve in our purchase requests businesses is dependent on our ability to originate or acquire and sell high quality purchase requests in sufficient volumes at profitable margins 
these purchase requests may be submitted by consumers through our websites or purchased from third party websites 
we actively compete for dealer and manufacturer table of contents customers with companies that maintain automotive purchase request referral businesses that are very similar to ours 
several of these competitors are larger than us and may have greater financial resources than we have 
in addition to competition for customers  we also compete with several of these companies in the acquisition of purchase requests from third party purchase request suppliers 
if we lose customers or quality purchase request supply volume to our competitors  or if our pricing or cost to acquire purchase requests is impacted  our business  results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely impacted 
the success we achieve in our advertising business is dependent on our ability to attract and acquire consumers to our websites and monetize that traffic at profitable margins with advertisers 
our consumer facing websites compete with offerings from the major internet portals  transaction based sites  automotive verticals websites with content that is primarily automotive in nature and numerous lifestyle websites 
our advertising business is characterized by minimal barriers to entry  and new competitors may be able to launch competitive services at relatively low costs 
if our websites do not provide a compelling  differentiated user experience  we may lose visitors to competing sites 
further  if our website traffic declines  we may lose relevance to our major advertisers who may reduce or eliminate their advertising buys 
we cannot provide any assurances that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors  many of which have substantially more technical and financial resources as well as existing brand recognition 
in addition  competitive pressures may result in increased marketing costs  decreased traffic to our websites or loss of market share that may materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations that may make it difficult for investors to predict our future performance 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future due to unforeseen events affecting the economy and industry in which we operate 
other factors that may adversely affect our quarterly operating results include our purchase request volume  which fluctuates with automotive industry sales volume that has some measure of seasonality 
typically  volume is highest in the spring and summer months  with lower volume in the fall and winter months 
as seasonality occurs  investors may not be able to predict our annual operating results based on a quarter to quarter comparison of our operating results 
seasonality in the automotive industry is likely to cause fluctuations in our operating results and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there are many risks associated with potential acquisitions 
we may evaluate potential acquisitions which we believe will complement or enhance our existing business 
if we acquire other companies in the future in exchange for our equity securities  existing stockholders may suffer dilution in the value of their shares and their percentage ownership 
the impact of dilution may restrict our ability or otherwise not allow us to consummate acquisitions using equity securities 
issuance of equity securities may restrict utilization of net operating loss carryforwards because of an annual limitation due to ownership change limitations under the internal revenue code 
we may also utilize cash and incur debt and losses related to the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets if we acquire another company  and this could negatively impact our liquidity and results of operations 
we may be unable to raise the capital necessary to consummate an acquisition 
we may be unable to integrate successfully the companies that we may acquire and management attention may be diverted 
we currently do not have any definitive agreements to acquire any company or business  and we may not be able to identify or complete any acquisition in the future 
risks associated with governmental regulation we have identified below areas of government regulation  which if changed or interpreted to apply to our business  we believe could be costly for us 
these laws and regulations include motor vehicle brokerage licensing laws  motor vehicle dealer licensing laws  franchise laws  insurance licensing laws  financial services laws  data security and privacy laws  and tax laws 
uncertainty exists in the application of various laws and regulations to our business 
new laws or regulations applicable to our business  or expansion or interpretation of existing laws and regulations to apply to our business  could subject us to licensing  claims  judgments and remedies  including monetary liabilities and limitations on our business practices  and could increase administrative costs or adversely affect our business 
although we do not believe that existing laws or regulations materially and adversely impact us  our business could be significantly affected by different interpretations or applications of existing laws or regulations  future laws or regulations  or actions or rulings by judicial or regulatory authorities 
we operate in a regulato ry climate in which there is uncertainty as to the application of various laws and regulations to our business 
our operations may be subjected to adoption  expansion or interpretation of various laws and regulations  and compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to obtain licenses at an undeterminable and possibly significant initial and annual expense 
these additional expenditures may increase future overhead  thereby potentially reducing our future results of operations 
there can be no assurance that future laws or regulations or interpretations or expansions of existing laws or regulations will not impose requirements on internet commerce that could table of contents substantially impair the growth of e commerce and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the popularity or impede the expansion of e commerce and internet marketing  restrict our present business practices  require us to implement costly compliance procedures or expose us and or our customers to potential liability  which  in turn  could adversely affect our business 
we may be considered to operate or do business in states where our customers conduct their business  resulting in regulatory action 
in the event any state s regulatory requirements impose state specific requirements on us or include us within an industry specific regulatory scheme  we may be required to modify our marketing programs in that state in a manner that may undermine the program s attractiveness to consumers or dealers 
in the alternative  if we determine that the licensing and related requirements are overly burdensome  we may elect to terminate operations in that state 
in each case  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
if automotive dealer or broker laws apply to us we may be required to modify or eliminate our marketing programs 
if we are unable to market our services in the manner we currently market our services  our revenues may decrease and our business may suffer 
all states comprehensively regulate vehicle sales and lease transactions  including strict licensure requirements for dealers and  in some states  brokers 
most of these laws and regulations  we believe  specifically address only traditional vehicle purchase and lease transactions  not internet based purchase request referral programs 
we do not believe that our marketing services programs qualify as automobile brokerage activity in most states and  therefore  we do not believe that state motor vehicle dealer o r broker licensing requirements apply to us in most states 
if we determine that the licensing or other regulatory requirements in a given state are applicable to us or to a particular marketing services program  we may elect to obtain required licenses and comply with applicable regulatory requirements 
however  if licensing or other regulatory requirements are overly burdensome  we may elect to terminate operations or particular marketing services programs in that state or elect to not operate or introduce particular marketing services programs in that state 
in some states we have modified our marketing programs or pricing models to reduce uncertainty regarding our compliance with local laws 
as we introduce new services  we may need to incur additional costs associated with additional licensing regulations and regulatory requirements 
if any state s licensing or other regulatory requirements relating to motor vehicle dealers or brokers are deemed applicable to us or to any par ticular marketing services program and we do not comply with those regulatory requirements  we may become subject to fines  penalties or other requirements and may be required to modify our marketing programs or pricing models in those states in a manner that undermines the attractiveness of the program to consumers or dealers 
in each case  our revenues may decline and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
if franchise laws apply to us we may be required to modify or eliminate our marketing programs 
if we are unable to market our services in the manner we currently market our services  our revenues may decrease and our business may suffer 
we believe that neither our relationship with our dealers nor our dealer subscription agreements constitute franchises under federal or state franchise laws 
however  if any state s regulatory requirements relating to franchises or our method of business impose additional requirements on us or include us within an industry specific regulatory scheme  we may be required to modify our marketing programs in that state in a manner that undermines the program s attractiveness to consumers or dealers 
if our relationship or written agreement with our dealers were found to be a franchise under federal or state franchise laws  we could be subject to additional requirements  such as franchise disclosure and registration requirements  and limitations on our ability to effect changes in our relationships with our dealers  which may negatively impact our ability to compete and cause our revenues to decrease and our business to suffer 
if we become subject to fines or other penalties or if we determine that the franchise and related requirements are overly burdensome  we may elect to terminate operations in that state 
if this happens  our revenues may decline and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
if financial broker licensing requirements apply to us in states where we are not currently licensed  we will be required to obtain additional licenses  and our business may suffer 
we provide a connection through our websites that allows consumers to obtain finance information and submit purchase requests for vehicle financing to third party lenders 
we also acquire finance related purchase requests from third parties 
we receive marketing fees from financial institutions and dealers in connection with this marketing activity 
we do not demand nor do we receive any fees from consumers for this service 
in the event states require us to be licensed as a financial broker  we may be unable to comply with a state s laws or regulations  or we could be required to incur significant fees and expenses to obtain any financial broker required license and comply with regulatory requirements 
in the event states require us to be licensed and we are unable to do so  or we are otherwise unable to comply with laws or regulations required by changes in current operations or the introduction of new services  we could be subject to fines or other penalties or be compelled to discontinue operations in those states  and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
if insurance licensing requirements apply to us in states where we are not currently licensed  we will be required to obtain additional licenses  and our business may suffer 
we provide links on our websites and referrals from call centers enabling consumers to be referred to third parties to receive quotes for insurance and extended warranty coverage from such table of contents third parties 
all on line applications for quotes are completed on the respective insurance carriers or other third party websites  and all applications for quotes obtained through call center referrals are conducted by the insurance carrier or other third party 
we receive marketing fees from participants in connection with this marketing activity 
we do not receive any premiums from consumers nor do we charge consumers fees for our services 
we do not believe that these activities require us to be licensed under state insurance laws 
however  if any state insurance licensing laws were determined to be applicable to us and if we are required to be licensed and we are unable to do so  or we are otherwise unable to comply with laws or regulations  we could be subject to fines or other penalties or be compelled to discontinue opera tions in those states  and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
changes in the taxation of internet commerce may result in increased costs 
because our business is dependent on the internet  the adoption of new local  state or federal tax laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations by governmental authorities may subject us to additional local  state or federal sales  use or income taxes and could decrease the growth of internet usage or marketing or the acceptance of internet commerce which could  in turn  decrease the demand for our services and increase our costs 
as a result  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
tax authorities in a number of states are currently reviewing and re evaluating the tax treatment of companies engaged in internet commerce  including the application of sales taxes to internet marketing businesses similar to ours 
we accrue for tax c ontingencies based upon our estimate of the taxes ultimately expected to be paid  which we update over time as more information becomes available 
the amounts ultimately paid in resolution of reviews or audits by taxing authorities could be materially different from the amounts we have accrued and result in additional tax expense  and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
data security and privacy risks our business is subject to various laws  rules and regulations relating to data security and privacy 
new data security and privacy laws  rules and regulations may be adopted regarding the internet or other on line services that could limit our business flexibility or cause us to incur higher compliance costs 
compliance with anti spam laws  rules and regulations may impose significant costs and burdens on our email marketing activities  and violations of these laws and regulations could subject us to fines or other enforcement actions 
among other laws  rules and regulations  federal and state legislation regulating email communications and internet advertising  such as proposed or adopted privacy related laws that restrict or prohibit unsolicited email commonly known as spam may adversely affect our ability to market our services to consumers in a cost effective manner 
violation of these laws may result in monetary fines or penalties or damage to our reputation 
the federal controlling the assault of non solicited pornography and marketing act of can spam imposes complex and often burdensome requirements in connection with sending commercial emails 
in addition  the language of can spam contains ambiguities  not all rules implementing can spam have yet been promulgated  and courts have not yet interpreted key provisions of can spam 
in addition  state laws regulating the sending of commercial emails  including california s law regulating the sending of commercial emails  to the extent found to not be preempted by can spam  may impose requirements or conditions more restrictive than can spam 
depending on how these laws are interpreted and applied  can spam and such state laws may impose significant costs and burdens on our email marketing services and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
failure to comply with data privacy laws  rules and regulations may significantly impact our business 
various laws  rules and regulations govern the collection  use  retention  sharing and security of data that we receive from our users  advertisers  and affiliates 
in addition  we have and post on our website our own privacy policies and practices concerning the collection  use and disclosure of user data and personal information 
any failure  or perceived failure  by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data related consent orders  federal trade commission requirements or orders or other federal or state privacy or consumer protection related laws  regulations or industry self regulatory principles could result in proceedings or actions ag ainst us by governmental entities or others  which could potentially have an adverse effect on our business 
further  failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies  applicable requirements  or industry self regulatory principles related to the collection  use  sharing or security of personal information or other privacy related matters could result in a loss of user confidence in us  damage to our brands  and ultimately in a loss of users  advertisers  or purchase request referral and advertising affiliates which could adversely affect our business 
we can not predict whether new legislation or regulations concerning data privacy and retention issues related to our business will be adopted 
certain proposals  if adopted  could impose requirements that may result in a decrease in our user registrations and revenues 
in addition  the interpretation and application of user data protection laws are currently unsettled 
new legislation being considered includes restrictions relating to the collection and use of data and information obtained through the tracking of internet use  including the possible implementation of a do not track list that would allow internet users to opt out of such table of contents tracking  could materially and adversely impact our data licensing services and other marketing services and our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
increased security risks of on line purchase requests collection and referral  advertising and e commerce may cause us to incur significant expenses and may negatively impact our credibility and business 
a significant issue for on line businesses like ours is the secure transmission of confidential and personal information over public networks 
concerns over the security of transactions conducted on the internet  consumer identity theft and user privacy issues have been significant barriers to growth in consumer use of the internet  on line advertising  and e commerce 
despite our implementation of security measures  our computer systems may be susceptible to electronic or physical computer break ins  viruses and other disruptive harms and security breaches 
adv ances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may specifically compromise our security measures 
any perceived or actual unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information regarding website visitors  whether through breach of our network by an unauthorized party  employee theft or misuse  or otherwise  could harm our reputation and brands  substantially impair our ability to attract and retain our audiences  or subject us to claims or litigation arising from damages suffered by consumers  and thereby harm our business and operating results 
if consumers experience identity theft after using any of our websites  we may be exposed to liability  adverse publicity and damage to our reputation 
to the extent that identity theft gives rise to reluctance to use our websites or a decline in consumer confidence in financial transactions over the internet  our business could be adversely affected 
alleged or actual breaches of the network of one of our b usiness partners or competitors whom consumers associate with us could also harm our reputation and brands 
in addition  we could incur significant costs in complying with the multitude of state  federal and foreign laws regarding the unauthorized disclosure of personal information 
for example  california law requires companies to inform individuals of any security breaches that result in their personal information being stolen 
because our success depends on the acceptance of on line services and e commerce  we may incur significant costs to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by those breaches 
internet fraud has been increasing over the past few years  and fraudulent on line transactions  should they continue to increase in prevalence  could also materially and adversely affect the customer experience and therefore our business  operating results and financial condition 
technology risks if we fail to detect click through fraud  we could lose the confidence of our advertisers  thereby causing our business to suffer 
we are exposed to the risk of fraudulent click throughs on advertisements displayed on our websites by persons seeking to increase the advertising fees paid to us 
click through fraud occurs when a person clicks on an advertisement displayed on our website in order to generate revenue to us and to increase the cost for the advertiser 
if we are unable to monitor and prevent this type of fraudulent activity  we may have to issue retroactive refunds of amounts previously paid to us if any such fraud is later detected 
this fraud could cause purchase request advertisers to become dissatisfied with our advertising programs  whi ch  in turn  could lead to a loss of advertisers and revenue and thus  materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success is dependent on keeping pace with advances in technology 
if we are unable to keep pace with advances in technology  consumers may stop using our services and our revenues will decrease 
if we are required to invest substantial amounts in technology  our results of operations will suffer 
the internet and electronic commerce markets are characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user and customer requirements  frequent new service and product introductions embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our existing websites and technology obsolete 
these market characteristics are intensified by the emerging nature of the market and the fact that many companies are expecte d to introduce new internet products and services in the near future 
if we are unable to adapt to changing technologies  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
our performance will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to enhance our existing services  develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers  license purchase requesting technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
the development of our websites and other proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 
we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our websites  or other proprietary technology to customer requirements or to emerging industry standards 
in addition  if we are required to invest substantial amounts in technology in order to keep pace with technological advanc es  our business results of operations and financial condition could suffer 
interruptions or failures in our information technology platforms  communication systems  or security systems could harm our operating results 
our information technology and communications systems are susceptible to outages and interruptions due to fire  flood  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failures  cyber attacks  terrorist attacks  failure of redundant systems and disaster recovery plans and similar events 
such outages and interruptions could damage our reputation and harm our operating results 
we are insured for some  but not all  of these events 
even for those events for table of contents which we are insured and have coverage under the terms and conditions of the applicable policies  there are no assurances given that the coverage limits would be sufficient to cover all losses we might incur or experience 
we rely on third party providers for our primary and secondary internet connections 
our co location service which provides environmental and power support for our technology platforms  communication systems  and security systems is received from a third party provider 
we have little or no control over these third party providers 
any disruption of the services they provide us or any failure of these third party providers to effectively plan for increases in capacity could  in turn  cause delays or disruptions in our services 
despite our network security measures  our information technology platforms are vulnerable to computer viruses  worms  physical and electronic break ins  sabotage  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering  as well as coordinated denial of service attacks 
we do not have multiple site capacity for all of our services 
in the event of delays or disruptions to services we rely on third party providers to perform disaster recovery planning and services on our behalf 
we are vulnerable to extended failures to the extent that planning and services are not adequate to meet our continued technology platform  communication or security systems needs 
for the foregoing reasons  interruptions or failures of our information technology platforms could materially and adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condi tion 
securities market risks the public market for our common stock may be volatile  especially since market prices for internet related and technology stocks have often been unrelated to operating performance 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq global market  but we cannot assure that an active trading market will be sustained or that the market price of the common stock will not decline 
the stock market in general has experienced significant price fluctuations 
the market price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to factors such as actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  historical and anticipated operating metrics such as the number of participating dealers  volume of purchase request deliveries to dealers  the number of visitors to our owned websites and the frequency with which they interact with our owned websites  announcements of new product or service offerings  technological innovations  low trading volumes  concentration of holdings in our common stock resulting in low public float for our shares  limited analyst coverage of the company  competitive developments  including actions by manufacturers  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to meet such estimates  conditions and trends in the internet  electronic commerce and automotive industries  our ability to comply with the conditions to continued listing of our stock on the nasdaq global market  adoption of new accounting standards affecting the technology or automotive industry  and general market or economic conditions and other factors 
further  the stock markets  and in particular the nasdaq global market  have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies and have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market factors have affected and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in addition  general economic  political and market conditions  such as recessions  interest rates  energy prices  international currency fluctuations  terrorist acts  political revolutions  military actions or wars  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been ins tituted against companies with publicly traded securities 
this litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq global market if we are not able to maintain continued listing requirements  and if this were to occur  the price of our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital may be adversely affected and the ability to buy and sell our stock may be less orderly and efficient 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq global market 
continued listing of a security on the nasdaq global market is conditioned upon compliance with various continued listing standards 
the standards for continued listing require  among other things  that the closing minimum bid price for the listed securities be at least per share for consecutive trading table of contents days 
in and  we received letters from the nasdaq stock market llc  notifying us that autobytel failed to meet the minimum bid price per share required for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
in each case  we regained compliance with the minimum bid price continued listing requirement within the grace period allowed to regain compliance 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to satisfy the requirements for maintaining the listing of our common stock on the nasdaq global market 
if our common stock were to be delisted from the nasdaq global market  the price of our common stock  the ability of holders to sell such stock  and our ability to raise additional capital will likely be adversely affected 
if our common stock is delisted and thereafter traded in the over the counter market  the ability to buy and sell our stock could be less orderly and efficient and more costly 
if we sought to relist our stock on the nasdaq global market we would be required to comply with all of the initial listing requirements to be relisted on the nasdaq global market  which in some instances are more stringent than the continued listing requirements 
risks associated with intellectual property and other litigation litigation regarding intellectual property rights is common in the internet and technology industries 
we expect that internet technologies and software products and services may be increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could impair our competitive position 
enforcement actions to protect our intellectual property could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our ability to compete depends upon our proprietary systems and technology 
while we rely on trademark  trade secret  patent and copyright law  confidentiality agreements and technical measures to protect our proprietary rights  we believe that the technical and creative skills of our personnel  continued development of our proprietary systems and technology  brand name recognition and reliable website maintenance are more essential in establishing and maintaining a leadership position and strengthening our brands 
as part of our procedures  we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to our trade secrets and technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult 
we have no assurance that the steps taken by us will prevent misappropriation of technology or that the agreements entered into for that purpose will be enforceable 
effective trademark  service mark  patent  copyright and trade secret protection may not be available when our products and services are made available on line 
in addition  litigation may be necessary to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of infringement or invalidity 
litigation  even if successful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of re sources and management attention and could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
misappropriation of our intellectual property or potential litigation could also have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we face risk of claims from third parties relating to intellectual property that could materially and adversely affect our business 
we have no assurance that our products and services do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
claims of infringement  even if unsuccessful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we are not successful  we may be subject to preliminary and permanent injunctive relief and monetary damages which may be trebled in the case willful infringements 
if awarded  these remedies could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we could be materially and adversely affected by other litigation 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation or legal matters not related to intellectual property rights and arising from the normal course of our business activities 
the actions filed against us and other litigation or legal matters  even if not meritorious  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention and an adverse outcome in litigation could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our liability insurance may not cover all potential claims to which we are exposed and may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that may be imposed 
any imposition of liability that is not cover ed by insurance or is in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
see part ii  item  note  commitments and contingencies litigation of this annual report on form k 
we could be adversely affected by actions of third parties that could subject us to litigation that could significantly and adversely affect our business 
we could face liability for information retrieved or obtained from or transmitted over the internet by third parties and liability for products sold over the internet by third parties 
we could be exposed to liability with respect to third party information that may be accessible through our websites  links or vehicle review services 
these claims might  for example  be made for defamation  negligence  patent  copyright or trademark infringement  personal injury  breach table of contents of contract  unfair competition  false advertising  invasion of privacy or other legal theories based on the nature  content or copying of these materials 
these claims might assert  among other things that  by directly or indirectly providing links to websites operated by third parties we should be liable for copyright or trademark infringement or other wrongful actions by such third parties through those websites 
it is also possible that  if any third party content provided on our websites contains errors  consumers could make claims against us for losses incurred in reliance on such information 
any claims could result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources  cause delays in releasing new or upgrading existing services or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
we also enter into agreements with other companies under which any revenue that results from the purchase or use of services through direct links to or from our websites or on our websites is shared 
in addition  we acquire personal information and data in the form of purchase requests purchased from third party websites involving consumers who submitted personally identifiable information and data to the third parties and not directly to us 
these arrangements may expose us to additional legal risks and uncertainties  including disputes with these parties regarding revenue sharing  local  state and federal government regulation and potential liabilities to consumers of these services  even if we do not provide the services ourselves or have direct contact with the consumer 
these liabilities can include liability for violations by these third parties of laws  rules and regulations  including those related to data security and privacy laws and regulations  unsolicited email  text messaging  telephone or wireless voice marketing  and licensing 
we have no assurance that any indemnification provided to us in our agreements with these third parties  if available  will be adequate 
we are uncertain of our ability to obtain additional financing for our future working capital needs 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing we may not be able to continue to operate our business 
under our current operating plan for  we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated needs for working capital and other cash requirements at least for the next months 
we may need to raise additional funds sooner  however  in order to develop new or enhance existing services or products or to respond to competitive pressures  or to acquire assets or businesses 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
recent macro economic conditions include reported reductions in available credit 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  our ability to develop or enhance services or products or respond to competitive pressures or acquire assets or businesses woul d be significantly limited 
in addition  our ability to continue to operate our business may also be materially and adversely affected in the event additional financing is not available when required 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  tax benefit preservation plan and delaware law contain provisions that could discourage a third party from acquiring us or limit the price third parties are willing to pay for our stock 
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws relating to our corporate governance and provisions in our tax benefit preservation plan tax benefit preservation plan could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  and could discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of us 
these provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control 
the issuance of preferred stock also could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers  including voting rights  of the holders of the common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allow us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation also provides that the board of directors is divided into three classes  which may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or change in our management because less than a majority of the board of directors are up for election at each annual meeting 
in addition  provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws impose various procedural and other requirements which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect corporate actions such as a merger  asset sale or other change of control of us 
under our tax benefit preservation plan  rights to purchase capital stock of the company rights have been distributed as a dividend at the rate of one right for each share of common stock 
each right entitles its holder  upon triggering of the rights  to purchase one one hundredth of a share of series a junior participating preferred stock of the company at a price of as such price may be adjusted under the tax benefit preservation plan or  in certain circumstances  to instead acquire shares of common stock 
the rights will convert into a right to acquire common stock or other capital stock of the company in certain circumstances and subject to certain exceptions 
the rights will be triggered upon the acquisition of or more of t he company s outstanding common stock or future acquisitions by any existing holders of or more of the company s outstanding common stock 
if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock  all rights holders  except the acquirer  will be entitled to acquire at the then exercise price of a right that number of shares of our common stock which  at the time  has a market value of two times the exercise price of the right 
table of contents we are also subject to section of the delaware general corporation law 
in general  the statute prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
for purposes of section  a business combination includes a merger  asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder  and an interested stockholder is a person who  together with affiliates and associates  owns or did own or more of the corporation s voting stock 
section could discourage a third party from a ttempting to acquire control of us 
if our internal controls and procedures fail  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow could be materially and adversely affected 
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting 
our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in making its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   management used the criteria described in internal control integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in a more than remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the ann ual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
management determined that we had no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting as of december  our internal controls may not prevent all potential errors and fraud  because any control system  no matter how well designed  can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system will be achieved 
we have had material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the past and there is no assurance that we will not have one or more material weaknesses in the future resulting from failure of our internal controls and procedures 
our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis could be adversely affected by a failure in our internal control over financial reporting 
if our financial statements are not fairly presented  investors may not have an accurate understanding of our operating results and financial condition 
if our financial statements are not timely filed with the sec  we could be delisted from the nasdaq global market 
if either or both of these events occur  it could have a material adverse affect on our ability to operate our business and the market price of our common stock 
in addition  a failure in our internal control over financial reporting could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flow
