overview cytori develops  manufactures  and commercializes innovative medical devices  which enable physicians to practice regenerative medicine worldwide 
cytori s core device provides real time access to patients own stem and regenerative cells which reside naturally within their adipose fat tissue 
these stem and regenerative cells may help to improve blood flow in damaged or diseased tissues and therefore can potentially be used to treat multiple conditions resulting from a lack of blood supply ischemia 
cytori has three key product lines the celution family  which includes the first and only broadly available device that provides clinical grade adipose derived autologous stem and regenerative cells for re injection into the patient at the point of care  the puregraft family for optimized preparation of autologous fat grafts  and the stemsource family for use in laboratory research and stem cell banking 
our business is based on the sale of our medical devices and laboratory equipment  the generation of recurring revenue thereafter from the sale of single use consumables used in every procedure  and sales of related instrumentation and ancillary products 
cytori s near term strategy is to focus first on development and sales of our approved products into the cosmetic and reconstructive surgery crs market and the cell banking market  which we believe can be successfully penetrated more quickly than our other target markets 
the market opportunity for cosmetic and reconstructive surgery alone is over billion worldwide 
in addition to our near term growth drivers  we are also working toward celution system claims for cardiovascular disease applications through ongoing and planned european clinical trials 
 cardiovascular disease is a multi billion dollar worldwide market 
other potential market opportunities for our technology include stress urinary incontinence  wound healing  burns  liver disease  renal failure  pelvic health conditions and gastrointestinal disorders 
our customers at academic hospitals are identifying and developing new applications for the celution output 
applications initially developed by our customers represent a broad catalog from which cytori can draw upon to incorporate into their own pipeline 
the more therapeutic applications that are developed for the celution system and its cellular output  the more opportunities we will have to offer the celution system and related consumable sets to hospitals  clinics  and physicians 
our current commercial activities are primarily focused on market development and sales of our celution and puregraft systems into the cosmetic and reconstructive surgery markets around the world 
with the expanded ce mark claims for the celution system to include breast reconstruction  repair of soft tissue defects  augmentation procedures and as well as crohn s wound healing in july  we have shifted our sales efforts to focus more on hospitals for cell enriched breast reconstruction and crohn s wound applications in europe and less on private  cosmetic clinics  while also supporting the company s efforts to gain treatment reimbursement 
adoption of cell enriched breast reconstruction has been strengthened by interim results from our restore trial for partial mastectomy defect reconstruction r eported in may and june final results from this trial are expected to be reported in the first half of also  in july  we received the ce mark for the puregraft pure system for autologous fat transfers 
the puregraft system is designed to facilitate and streamline the fat graft preparation process  washing and filtering the tissue to remove contaminants and is sold in europe as both a standalone product for cosmetic procedures and as a complement to cytori s celution system in europe for reconstructive procedures 
having both puregraft and celution approved in europe allows cytori to offer a broader portfolio of products to plastic and cosmetic surgeons and expand our market opportunity 
in addition  the puregraft system offers a lower cost entry point for customers to whom we could potentially up sell a celution system 
in the united states  we are currently focused on expanding our autologous fat grafting business with the sale of the puregraft system and related products 
fat grafting procedures have seen an upsurge in popularity in recent years 
puregraft is positioned to be a leader as the market makes the conscious shift from artificial to natural procedures 
with k clearance of puregraft in january and the formal product launch in april  we have built an initial regional physician customer base and are working to expand acceptance of the technology in the united states 
in addition to expanding our us sales team in  we have put an increased focus on our consumer marketing for both reconstructive and cosmetic procedures through practice development activities designed to educate doctors about our technology 
by working with our customers to fully integrate cytori technology into their practices  we are providing a valuable service and further distinguishing our brand 
in addition to our commercial activities in europe and the united states where we are focused primarily on reconstructive and cosmetic surgery  we are also pursuing commercialization strategies for the celution system into japan and other asia pacific markets  with limited sales into the translational medicine markets 
in  we laid the foundation for an emerging market commercialization strategy 
to this end  we established an office in mumbai  india and have begun building key relationships in these regions 
in  our emerging market strategic activities will focus on india  brazil  argentina  australia  kuala lumpur  new zealand and thailand with the goal of establishing a celution presence in the growing regenerative medicine market 
we anticipate that the stemsource cell banking business will continue to contribute to product sales in  but we expect sales to further ramp once a greater number of therapeutic applications are available 
with the tissue banking capabilities introduced in  we believe that an increasing number of cell bank orders will be from cosmetic and reconstructive surgery clinics in regions where physicians are already performing elective liposuction 
the stemsource mb  is marketed as a standalone piece of laboratory research equipment and serves as the foundation of the stemsource cell bank  both of which are offered worldwide to hospitals  tissue banks and other research centers 
once installed  commercialization activities are performed predominantly by our customers 
as we move forward in  we will continue to seek regulatory and marketing approval of the celution system family of products in the united states as a medical device 
we filed a k marketing application for use in aesthetic body contouring and or filling of soft tissue voids with the fda in november our application was reviewed by the fda center for biologics evaluation and research as a medical device 
in february  we were informed by the fda that we will be required to seek approval for the celution system for use in aesthetic body contouring and filling of soft tissue defect voids through the pre market approval application pma process 
we are now working to determine the necessary size and scope of clinical studies to obtain this approval of celution and are exploring multiple addit ional avenues to bring celution to the united states 
we also intend to build upon the advancements made to our cardiovascular pipeline and to take the next step in potentially bringing these applications for the celution system to market 
in  we reported positive six month primary outcomes in both our safety and feasibility trials for acute heart attack the apollo trial and for chronic myocardial ischemia the precise trial at the th international symposium on stem cell therapy cardiovascular innovations in may and at the meeting of the american heart association aha in november 
eighteen month data was reported from the precise study also at the aha meeting 
we are looking to leverage data from the precise study for future regulatory applications 
in addition  w e are currently in the process of initiating our advance trial for acute heart attack patients 
the advance trial will be a randomized  double blind  placebo controlled european approval trial that is expected to range in size from to patients 
the trial will utilize the next generation celution one system 
in january  cytori received approval to initiate the trial in the netherlands 
we expect to continue to initiate up to trial sites  predominantly in europe  through the first half of our strategy for the future  with a new product that has multiple potential applications  is to focus the majority of our financial resources on activities that will promote immediate sales of the celution  stemsource  and puregraft products  through investment in sales and marketing activities 
other key drivers for the future include the planning and initiation of a cardiac pivotal trial  which we believe will increase the long term prospects for the company  the introduction of celution one and the continued development and innovation of our technology 
we can effectively manage our investment in these initiatives with our current cash position  but we may need to raise additional funds to further broaden our investment in our other pipeline products 
olympus partnership on november   we entered into a strategic development and manufacturing joint venture agreement and other related agreements with olympus 
as part of the terms of these agreements  we formed a joint venture  olympus cytori  inc joint venture  to develop and manufacture future generation devices based on our celution system platform 
under the joint venture agreements olympus paid  for its interest in the joint venture 
moreover  olympus simultaneously entered into a license joint development agreement with the joint venture and us to develop a second generation commercial system and manufacturing capabilities 
we licensed our device technology  including the celution system platform and certain related intellectual property  to the joint venture for use in future generation devices 
these devices will process and purify adult stem and regenerative cells residing in adipose fat tissue for various therapeutic clinical applications 
in exchange for this license  we received a interest in the joint venture  as well as an initial  payment from the joint venture  the source of this payment was the  contributed to the joint venture by olympus 
moreover  upon receipt of a ce mark for the first generation celution system platform in januar y  we received an additional  development milestone payment from the joint venture 
put calls and guarantees the shareholders agreement between cytori and olympus provides that in certain specified circumstances of insolvency or if we experience a change in control  olympus will have the rights to i repurchase our interests in the joint venture at the fair value of such interests or ii sell its own interests in the joint venture to cytori at the higher of a  or b the put s fair value 
as of december   the fair value of the put was  fluctuations in the estimated put value are recorded in the statements of operations as a component of change in fair value of option liabilities 
the estimated fair value of the put has been recorded as a long term liability on the balance sheet in the option liability caption 
the put has no expiration date 
accordingly  we will continue to recognize a liability for the put and mark it to market each quarter until it is exercised or until the arrangements with olympus are amended 
the joint venture currently has exclusive access to our celution system device technology for the development  manufacture  and supply of such systems to us 
once a second generation celution system is developed and approved by regulatory agencies  the joint venture will exclusively supply us with these systems at a formula based transfer price 
we have retained all marketing rights subject to our various distribution agreements to sell the celution system devices for all therapeutic applications of adipose stem and regenerative cells 
we have worked closely with olympus team of scientists and engineers to design the future generations of the celution system so that it will contain certain product enhancements and that can be manufactured in a streamlined manner 
in august  we entered into a license and royalty agreement with the joint venture which provides us the ability to commercially launch the celution system platform earlier than we could have otherwise done so under the terms of the joint venture agreements 
the royalty agreement allows us to manufacture the cytori developed celution system platform  including the celution crs  until such time as the joint venture s products are commercially available for the same market served by the cytori platform  subject to a reasonable royalty that will be payabl e to the joint venture for all such sales 
we account for our investment in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting 
other related party transactions in a separate agreement entered into on february   we granted olympus an exclusive right to negotiate a commercialization collaboration for the use of adipose stem and regenerative cells for a specific therapeutic area outside of cardiovascular disease 
in exchange for this right  we received a  payment from olympus 
as part of this agreement  olympus could conduct market research and pilot clinical studies in collaboration with us for the therapeutic area up to december  when this exclusive right expired 
accordingly  on december   we recognized  as other development revenue and reduced our deferred revenues  related party balance for the same amount 
on february   we agreed to sell  shares of unregistered common stock to green hospital supply  inc for  cash  or per share  in a private stock placement 
on february   we closed the first half of the private placement with green hospital supply  inc and received  we closed the second half of the private placement on april  and received the second payment of in august  we received an additional  from olympus in a private placement of  unregistered shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at an original exercise price of per share 
the purchase price was per unit with each unit consisting of one share and warrant coverage 
the warrant is exercisable anytime after february  and will expire on august  thin film japan distribution agreement in  we sold the majority of our thin film business to mast biosurgery ag mast 
we retained all rights to thin film business in japan subject to a purchase option of mast  which expired in may  and we received back from mast a license of all rights to thin film technologies in the spinal field  exclusive at least until  and the field of regenerative medicine  non exclusive on a perpetual basis 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a distribution agreement with senko medical trading company senko 
under this agreement  we granted to senko an exclusive license to sell and distribute certain thin film products in japan 
specifically  the license covers thin film products with the following indications anti adhesion  soft tissue support  and minimization of the attachment of soft tissues 
the distribution agreement with senko commences upon commercialization 
commercialization will occur when one or more thin film product registrations are completed with the japanese ministry of health  labour and welfare  or mhlw 
following commercialization  the distribution agreement has a duration of five years and is renewable for an additional five years after re aching mutually agreed minimum purchase guarantees 
we received a  upfront license fee from senko 
we have recorded the  received as a component of deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
half of the license fee is refundable if the parties agree commercialization is not achievable and a proportional amount is refundable if we terminate the arrangement  other than for material breach by senko  before three years post commercialization 
under the distribution agreement  we will also be entitled to earn additional payments from senko based on achieving defined milestones 
on september   we notified senko of completion of the initial regulatory application to the mhlw for the thin film product 
as a result  we became entitled to a nonrefundable payment of  which we received in october and recorded as a component of deferred revenues 
we did not recognize any development revenues with respect to senko during each of the years ended december   and to date we have recognized a total of  in development revenues all of which was recognized prior to related to this agreement 
results of operations product revenues product revenues consisted of revenues from our celution and puregraft systems and stemsource cell banks 
the following table summarizes the components for the years ended december    and years ended related party third party total product revenues attributable to olympus attributable to green hospital supply beginning in march of  we began sales and shipments of our celution crs system to the european and asia pacific reconstructive surgery markets and during we began sales of our puregraft system in the united states and europe 
assuming all other applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met  revenue for these product sales is recognized upon delivery to the customer  as all risks and rewards of ownership have been substantively transferred to the customer at that point 
for product sales to customers who arrange for and manage all aspects of the shipping process  we recognize revenue upon shipment from our facilities 
for product sales that include a combination of equipment  services  or other multiple deliverables that will be provided in the future  we defer an estimate of the fair value of those future deliverables from product revenue until such deliverables have been provided or earned 
shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers are classified as revenue 
the future we expect to continue to generate product revenues from celution crs and consumable sales in europe and we expect to continue to generate product revenues from stemsource cell bank sales and celution system translational medical sales in japan through direct sales and through our distribution partner green hospital supply  from stemsource banking and research products in the united states and elsewhere through direct sales and through our distribution partner ge healthcare  and we also expect to generate puregraft system sales in the us and europe 
additionally  we expect to have thin film product revenues  pending regulatory approval  when commercialization of the thin film products in japan occurs and we begin t hin film shipments to senko 
cost of product revenues cost of product revenues relate primarily to celution and puregraft system products and stemsource cell banks and includes material  manufacturing labor  and overhead costs 
the following table summarizes the components of our cost of revenues for the years ended december   and years ended cost of product revenues share based compensation total cost of product revenues total cost of product revenues as of product revenues cost of product revenues as a percentage of product revenues was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fluctuation in this percentage is to be expected due to the product mix as well as mix of distributor and direct sales comprising the revenue for the period 
for the year ended december   cost of sales included an economic benefit of approximately  related to material cost and labor overhead previously expensed as research and development prior to commercialization date of march  that was sold during the year ended december  the future 
we expect to continue to see variation in our gross profit margin as the product mix comprising revenues fluctuates 
additionally  we expect to incur costs related to our macropore products if and when commercialization is achieved for our japan thin film product line 
development revenues the following table summarizes the components of our development revenues for the years ended december   and years ended milestone revenue olympus other revenue olympus research grant nih grant revenue regenerative cell storage services other total development revenues we recognize deferred revenues  related party  as development revenue when certain performance obligations are met ie  using a proportional performance approach 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus as a result of achieving one product development milestone as well as a clinical milestone related to the assessment of trial outcomes at months in one of our cardiac trials 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangement with olympus as a result of achieving three clinical milestones during the year 
the clinical milestones reflect the achievement of the primary goals of safety and feasibility  the completion o f the enrollment process for both of our clinical cardiac trials  and completion of a monitoring end point for one cardiac trial 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue associated with our arrangements with olympus as a result of completing two study milestones 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of other development revenue that relates to the agreement we entered into on february   in which we granted olympus an exclusive right to negotiate a commercialization collaboration for the use of adipose stem and regenerative cells for a specific therapeutic area outside of cardiovascular disease 
in exchange for this right  we received a  payment from olympus 
as part of this agreement  olympus could conduct market research and pilot clinical studies in collaboration with us for the therapeutic area up to december  when this exclusive right expired 
accordingly  on december   we recognized  as other development revenue and reduced our deferred  related party balance for the same amount 
the research grant revenue related to our agreement with the national institutes of health nih 
under this arrangement  the nih reimbursed us for qualifying expenditures related to research on adipose tissue derived cells for vascular cell therapy 
to receive funds under the grant arrangement  we were required to i demonstrate that we incurred qualifying expenses  as defined in the grant agreement between the nih and us  ii maintain a system of controls  whereby we can accurately track and report all expenditures related solely to research on adipose tissue derived cells for vascular cell therapy  and iii file appropriate forms and follow appropriate protocols established by the nih 
during the year ended december   we incurred  in qualified expenditures 
we recognized a total of  in revenues for the year ended december   which included allowable grant fees as well as cost reimbursements 
there were no comparable revenues and expenditures for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we received a  federal grant from the internal revenue service as part of the qualifying therapeutic discovery program qtdp 
the qtdp  administered by the department of health and human services and the department of the treasury  was enacted to encourage biomedical research for projects that show the greatest potential to create and sustain high quality  high paying us jobs and to advance us competitiveness in life  biological and medical sciences 
through this program  eligible companies can elect to receive either a cash grant or a tax credit 
we elected to receive a cash grant and the funds were received during late the future 
we may recognize additional development revenues during  as the anticipated completion for the next phase of our joint venture and other olympus product development performance obligations is in if we are successful in completing these activities  we may recognize approximately  in development revenues during the exact timing of when amounts will be reported in revenue will depend on internal factors for instance  our ability to complete certain contributions and obligations that we have agreed to perform as well as external considerations  including obtaining certain regulatory clearances and or approvals related to the celution system 
the cash for these contributions and obligations was re ceived when the agreement was signed and no further related cash payments will be made to us 
we will continue to recognize revenue from the thin film development work we are performing on behalf of senko  based on the relative fair value of the milestones completed as compared to the total efforts expected to be necessary to obtain regulatory clearance from the mhlw 
we are still awaiting regulatory clearance from the mhlw in order for initial commercialization to occur 
accordingly  we expect to recognize approximately  consisting of  in deferred revenues plus a non refundable payment of  to be received upon commercialization in revenues associated with this milestone arrangement if and when regulatory approval is achieved 
moreover  we expect to recognize  per year associated with deferred senko license fees over a three year period following commercializatio n  if achieved  as the refund rights associated with the license payment expire 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include costs associated with the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products  regulatory fees  the purchase of laboratory supplies  pre clinical studies  and clinical studies 
the following table summarizes the components of our research and development expenses for the years ended december   and years ended regenerative cell technology regenerative cell technology development milestone joint venture research grants nih stock based compensation total research and development expenses research and development expenses relate to the development of a technology platform that involves using adipose tissue as a source of autologous regenerative cells for therapeutic applications 
these expenses  in conjunction with our continued development efforts related to our celution system  result primarily from the broad expansion of our research and development efforts enabled by the funding we received from olympus in and and from other investors during the last few years 
the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is primarily due to the decrease in clinical and preclinical study expense of  and decrease in supplies related expense of  primarily due to the decreased research and development experiment supplies usage as well as supplies purchased for prototype work prior to the related product commercialization 
the decrease in research and development expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in is primarily due a decrease in labor related expenses  not including share based compensation  of  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in primarily due to the decrease in headcount for our research and development department as a result of a reduction in force implemented by the management at the end of the first quarter of and third quarter of in efforts to cut costs as well as achievement of commercialization and transfer of employees from research and development to the manufacturing department 
additionally  professional services expense decreased by  from to  primarily due to decreased use of consultants and temporary labo r during the year ended december  expenses for supplies decreased by  from to  primarily due to purchases of production supplies prior to the related product line commercialization  which occurred on march  these reductions were offset by an increase of  from to due primarily to increased clinical study activity and the associated expense 
expenditures related to the joint venture with olympus  which are included in the variation analysis above  include costs that are necessary to support the commercialization of future generation devices  including the next generation celution system 
these development activities  which began in november  include performing pre clinical and clinical studies  seeking regulatory approval  and performing product development related to therapeutic applications for adipose stem and regenerative cells for multiple large markets 
the following table summarizes the components of our development milestone joint venture expenses for the years ended december   and years ended labor and related benefits consulting and other professional services supplies other miscellaneous total development milestone joint venture the future we expect research and development expenditures to increase in as we are scheduled to begin enrollment in the advance cardiac trial in the first half of sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses include costs of marketing personnel  tradeshows  physician training  and promotional activities and materials 
the following table summarizes the components of our sales and marketing expenses for the years ended december   and years ended sales and marketing stock based compensation total sales and marketing the increase in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was mainly attributed to the increase in salary and related benefits expense excluding share based compensation of  an increase in travel related expenses of  increased promotional expenses of  and an increase in professional services of  which are due to our emphasis in seeking strategic alliances and or co development partners 
the increase in sales and marketing expense for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in was mainly attributed to the increase in salary and related benefits expense excluding share based compensation of  and an increase in professional services of  the future 
we expect sales and marketing expenditures related to the regenerative cell technology to increase as we continue to expand our base of distribution partners  strategic alliances and co development partners  as well as our direct marketing sales force for our celution system and stemsource cell bank 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include costs for administrative personnel  legal and other professional expenses and general corporate expenses 
the following table summarizes the general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and years ended general and administrative stock based compensation total general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the increase in general and administrative expenses excluding share based compensation occurred primarily due to an increase in salary and related benefits expense of  and an increase in professional services expense of  for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  the decrease in general and administrative expenses excluding share based compensation occurred primarily due to a decrease in professional services expense of  for the year ended december  as compared to the same periods in  partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense of  the decreases resulted from management efforts to decrease costs 
the future 
we expect general and administrative expenses to stay at approximately the same level in stock based compensation expenses stock based compensation expenses include charges related to options issued to employees  directors and non employees 
we measure stock based compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of any awards granted to our employees 
such expense is recognized over the period of time that employees provide service to us and earn all rights to the awards 
stock based compensation expense related to options to purchase common stock issued to non employees is based on the fair value of the stock on the date of issuance  even if such stock contains sales restrictions 
the following table summarizes the components of our stock based compensation for the years ended december   and years ended cost of product revenues research and development related sales and marketing related general and administrative related total stock based compensation most of the share based compensation expenses for the years ended december   and related to the vesting of stock option awards to employees 
during the first quarter of  we issued to our directors  executive officers and certain non executive employees options to purchase an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock  with four year vesting for our officers and employees and two year vesting for our directors 
the grant date fair value of the awards granted to our officers and employees was and to our directors was per share 
the resulting share based compensation expense of  net of estimated forfeitures  will be recognized as expense over the respective vesting periods 
during the first quarter of  we made a company wide option grant to our non executive employees to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  subject to a four year graded vesting schedule 
the grant date fair value of the awards was per share 
following the reduction of our workforce at the end of this quarter   of these options remained outstanding 
the resulting share based compensation expense of  net of estimated forfeitures  is being recognized as expense over the employees respective expected vesting periods 
during the first quarter of  we issued to our officers and directors options to purchase an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock  with four year graded vesting for our officers and two year graded vesting for our directors 
the grant date fair value of the awards granted to our officers and directors was per share 
the resulting share based compensation expense of  net of estimated forfeitures  is being recognized as expense over the respective expected vesting periods 
during the second quarter of  we made a company wide option grant to our non executive employees to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  subject to a four year graded vesting schedule 
the grant date fair value of the awards was per share 
the resulting share based compensation expense of  net of estimated forfeitures  is being recognized as expense over the employees respective expected vesting periods 
during the third quarter of  we issued  shares of restricted common stock to a non employee consultant 
the stock is restricted in that it cannot be sold for a specified period of time 
there are no vesting requirements 
because the shares issued are not subject to additional future vesting or service requirements  the stock based compensation expense of  recorded in the third quarter of constitutes the entire expense related to this grant  and no future period charges will be incurred 
during the first quarter of  we issued to our officers and directors stock options to purchase up to  shares of our common stock  with a four year graded vesting schedule for our officers and two year graded vesting for our directors 
the grant date fair value of option awards granted to our officers and directors was per share 
the resulting share based compensation expense of  net of estimated forfeitures  is being recognized as expense over the respective expected vesting periods 
the future 
we will continue to grant options which will result in an expense to our employees and  as appropriate  to non employee service providers 
in addition  previously granted options will continue to vest in accordance with their original terms 
as of december   the total compensation cost related to non vested stock options not yet recognized for all our plans is approximately  these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
change in fair value of warrant liability the following is a table summarizing the change in fair value of warrant liability for the years ended december   and years ended december  change in fair value of warrant liability effective january   we changed our method of accounting for certain common stock purchase warrants with exercise price reset features due to the adoption of a new accounting standard 
these warrants were issued in connection with our august private placement of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants 
the warrants had an original exercise price of and expire in august under the new standard  these warrants previously recognized in stockholders equity deficit are now accounted for as fair value liabilities  with changes in fair value included in net earnings loss 
the common stock purchase warrants were not issued with the intent of effectively hedging any future cash flow  fair value of any asset  liability or any net investment in a foreign operation 
the warrants do not qualify for hedge accounting  and as such  all future changes in the fair value of these warrants will be recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised or expire 
these common stock purchase warrants do not trade in an active securities market  and as such  we estimate the fair value of these warrants using the black scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions as of december  as of december  expected term years years common stock market price risk free interest rate expected volatility resulting fair value per warrant expected volatility is based primarily on historical volatility 
historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods that correspond to the expected term of the warrants 
we believe this method produces an estimate that is representative of our expectations of future volatility over the expected term of these warrants 
we currently have no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of these warrants is likely to differ materially from historical volatility 
the expected life is based on the remaining term of the warrants 
the risk free interest rate is the interest rate for treasury constant maturity instruments published by the federal reserve board that is closest to the expected term of the warrant 
the future 
future changes in the fair value of the warrant liability will be recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised or expire 
change in fair value of option liability the following is a table summarizing the change in fair value of option liability for the years ended december   and years ended change in fair value of option liability in reference to the joint venture  the shareholders agreement between cytori and olympus provides that in certain specified circumstances of insolvency or if we experience a change in control  olympus will have the right to i repurchase our interests in the joint venture at the fair value of such interests or ii sell its own interests in the joint venture to us at the higher of a  or b the put s fair value 
the put has been classified as a liability 
the valuations of the put were completed using an option pricing theory based simulation analysis ie  a monte carlo simulation 
the valuations are based on assumptions as of the valuation date with regard to the market value of cytori and the estimated fair value of the joint venture  the expected correlation between the values of cytori and the joint venture  the expected volatility of cytori and the joint venture  the bankruptcy recovery rate for cytori  the bankruptcy threshold for cytori  the probability of a change of control event for cytori  and the risk free interest rate 
the following assumptions were employed in estimating the value of the put december  december  december  expected volatility of cytori expected volatility of the joint venture bankruptcy recovery rate for cytori bankruptcy threshold for cytori probability of a change of control event for cytori expected correlation between fair values of cytori and the joint venture in the future risk free interest rate the future 
the put has no expiration date 
accordingly  we will continue to recognize a liability for the put until it is exercised or until the arrangements with olympus are amended 
financing items the following table summarizes interest income  interest expense  and other income and expenses for the years ended december   and years ended interest income interest expense other income expense  net total interest income decreased for the year december  as compared to the same period in and primarily due to a decrease in interest rates 
interest expense increased in as compared to and due to cash interest and non cash amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount for the million term loan 
during the second quarter of  we entered into an amended and restated loan and security agreement  pursuant to which the lenders funded a term loan in the amount of million on june   and which refinanced the remaining balance of the term loan from the changes in other income expense in  and resulted primarily from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the future 
interest income earned in the remainder of will be dependent on our levels of funds available for investment as well as general economic conditions 
subject to our future financing activities  we expect interest expense in to increase as we continue to pay interest on the million term loan that funded in june equity loss from investment in joint venture the following table summarizes equity loss from investment in joint venture for the years ended december   and years ended equity loss from investment in joint venture the losses relate entirely to our equity interest in the joint venture  which we account for using the equity method of accounting 
the future 
we do not expect to recognize significant losses from the activities of the joint venture in the foreseeable future 
over the next one to two years  the joint venture is expected to incur labor costs related to the development of our second generation commercial system as well as general and administrative expenses  offset by royalty and product revenue expected to be generated by our current celution crs and future generation devices 
though we have no obligation to do so  we plan to contribute funding to the joint venture to cover any costs should the joint venture deplete its cash balance

critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and that affect our recognition and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
while our estimates are based on assumptions we consider reasonable at the time they were made  our actual results may differ from our estimates  perhaps significantly 
if results differ materially from our estimates  we will make adjustments to our financial statements prospectively as we become aware of the necessity for an adjustment 
we believe it is important for you to understand our most critical accounting policies 
these are our policies that require us to make our most significant judgments and  as a result  could have the greatest impact on our future financial results 
warrant liability effective january   we changed our method of accounting for certain common stock purchase warrants with exercise price reset features due to the adoption of a new accounting standard 
these warrants were issued in connection with our august private placement of  unregistered shares of common stock and  common stock warrants 
the warrants had an original exercise price of and expire in august under the new standard  these warrants previously recognized in stockholders equity deficit are now accounted for as fair value liabilities  with changes in fair value included in net earnings loss 
the cumulative effect of the adoption is to present these warrants as liabilities on the date of the adoption as if they had been accounted for as liabilities since the warrants were issued 
as a result  on january   we recognized a million long term warrant liability  a million decrease in accumulated deficit and a corresponding decrease in additional paid in capital of million 
the fair value of these warrants increased to million as of december   which resulted in a million loss from the change in fair value of warrants for the year ended december  the fair value of these warrants decreased to million as of december   which resulted in a million gain from the change in fair value of warrants for the year ended december  since these warrants do not qualify for hedge accounting  all future changes in the fair value of the warrants will be recognized currently in earnings until such time as the warrants are exercised or expire 
these warrants are not traded in an active securities market  and as such  we estimated the fair value of these warrants using the black scholes option pricing model using the following assumptions as of december  as of december  expected term years years common stock market price risk free interest rate expected volatility resulting fair value per warrant expected volatility is based on historical volatility 
historical volatility was computed using daily pricing observations for recent periods that correspond to the expected term of the warrants 
we believe this method produces an estimate that is representative of our expectations of future volatility over the expected term of these warrants 
we currently have no reason to believe future volatility over the expected remaining life of these warrants is likely to differ materially from historical volatility 
the expected life is based on the remaining term of the warrants 
the risk free interest rate is the interest rate for treasury constant maturity instruments published by the federal reserve board that is closest to the expected term of the warrant 
revenue recognition product sales we recognize revenue from product sales when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting accounts receivable is reasonably assured 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
revenue for these product sales is recognized upon delivery to the customer  as all risks and rewards of ownership have been substantively transferred to the customer at that point 
for sales to customers who arrange for and manage the shipping process  we recognize revenue upon shipment from our facilities 
shipping and handling costs that are billed to our customers are classified as revenue 
the customer s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of delivery and are not dependent on the subsequent use or resale of our product 
for those sales that include multiple deliverables  we allocate revenue based on the relative fair values of the individual components 
when more than one element such as product maintenance or technical support services are included in an arrangement  we allocate revenue between the elements based on each element s relative fair value  provided that each element meets the criteria for treatment as a separate unit of accounting 
an item is considered a separate unit of accounting if it has value to the customer on a standalone basis and there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
fair value is generally determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
in the absence of fair value for a delivered element  we allocate reve nue first to the fair value of the undelivered elements and allocate the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
fair values for undelivered elements are determined based on vendor specific objective evidence as well as market participant quotes for similar services 
deferred service revenue is recognized ratably over the period the services are provided 
in the absence of fair value for an undelivered element  the arrangement is accounted for as a single unit of accounting  resulting in a deferral of revenue recognition for delivered elements until all undelivered elements have been fulfilled 
concentration of significant customers our asia pacific and north america region sales accounted for of our product revenue recognized for the year ended december  additionally  two customers accounted for of total outstanding accounts receivable as of december  for the year ended december   our sales were concentrated with three distributors and one direct customer  which in aggregate comprised of our product revenue recognized for the year ended december  our asia pacific  north america and europe region sales accounted for of our product revenue recognized for the year ended december  additionally  one distributor and two direct customers accounted for of total outstanding accounts receivable as of december  research and development we earn revenue for performing tasks under research and development agreements with both commercial enterprises  such as olympus and senko  and governmental agencies like the national institutes of health nih 
revenue earned under development agreements is classified as either research grant or development revenues depending on the nature of the arrangement 
revenues derived from reimbursement of direct out of pocket expenses for research costs associated with grants are recorded as research grant and other within development revenues 
research grant revenue is recorded at the gross amount of the reimbursement 
the costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  r esearch and development arrangements we have with commercial enterprises such as olympus and senko are considered a key component of our central and ongoing operations 
accordingly  when recognized  the inflows from such arrangements are presented as revenues in our consolidated statements of operations 
we received funds from olympus and olympus cytori  inc during and we recorded upfront fees totaling  as deferred revenues  related party 
in exchange for these proceeds  we agreed to a provide olympus cytori  inc an exclusive and perpetual license to our celution system device technology and certain related intellectual property  and b provide future development contributions related to commercializing the celution system platform 
the license and development services are not separable and as a result the recognition of this deferred amount requires achievement of service related milestones  under a proportional performance methodology 
if and as such revenues are recognized  deferred revenue will be decreased 
proportional performance me thodology was elected due to the nature of our development obligations and efforts in support of the joint venture including product development activities and regulatory efforts to support the commercialization of the joint venture products 
the application of this methodology uses the achievement of r d milestones as outputs of value to the joint venture 
we received up front  non refundable payments in connection with these development obligations  which we have broken down into specific r d milestones that are definable and substantive in nature  and which will result in value to the joint venture when achieved 
as our research and development efforts progress  we periodically evaluate  and modify if necessary  the milestone points in our proportional performance model to ensure that revenue recognition accurately reflects our best estimate of substantive value deliverable to the joint venture 
revenue will be recognized as the above mentioned r d m ilestones are completed 
of the amounts received and deferred  we recognized development revenues of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
all related development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in research and development expense on the statement of operations 
under a distribution agreement with senko  we granted to senko an exclusive license to sell and distribute certain thin film products in japan 
we have also earned or will be entitled to earn additional payments under the distribution agreement based on achieving the defined research and development milestones 
there was no development revenue recognized during the years ended december   and goodwill impairment testing in late  we purchased stemsource  inc and recognized over  in goodwill associated with the acquisition  of which  remains on our balance sheet as of december  we test this goodwill at least annually for impairment as well as when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
the application of the goodwill impairment test involves a substantial amount of judgment 
the judgments employed may have an effect on whether a goodwill impairment loss is recognized 
this testing must be performed at a level of the organization known as the reporting unit 
a reporting unit is at least the same level as a company s operating segments  and sometimes even one level lower 
we currently operate under a single reporting unit 
the process for testing goodwill for impairment involves the comparison of fair value of our business to the carrying value of our net assets 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount  goodwill may be impaired additional testing is required 
in  all goodwill that previously had been assigned to our macropore biosurgery reporting unit was derecognized as a result of our sale of our spine and orthopedic product line to kensey nash 
accordingly  there was no need to test this component of our business for goodwill impairment 
we completed our goodwill impairment testing as of november  using an income based approach incorporating discounted projections of estimated future cash flows as well as a market based approach 
we concluded that for all periods presented  our fair value exceeded carrying value  and that none of our reported goodwill was impaired 
variable interest entity olympus cytori joint venture a variable interest entity  or vie  must be consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
evaluating whether an entity is a vie and determining its primary beneficiary involves significant judgment 
we concluded that the olympus cytori joint venture was a vie based on the following factors an entity is a vie if it has insufficient equity to finance its activities 
we recognized that the initial cash contributed to the joint venture formed by olympus and cytori  would be completely utilized by the first quarter of moreover  it was highly unlikely that the joint venture would be able to obtain the necessary financing from third party lenders without additional subordinated financial support such as personal guarantees by one or both of the joint venture stockholders 
accordingly  the joint venture will require additional financial support from olympus and cytori to finance its ongoing operations  indicating that the joint venture is a vie 
in fact  we contributed   and  in   and  respectively 
olympus has a contingent put option that would  in specified circumstances  require cytori to purchase olympus s interests in the joint venture for a fixed amount of  accordingly  olympus is protected in some circumstances from absorbing all expected losses in the joint venture  and as such  olympus may not be an at risk equity holder  although olympus clearly has decision rights over the operations of the joint venture 
because the joint venture is undercapitalized  and because one of the joint venture s decision makers may be protected from losses  we have determined that the joint venture is a vie 
as noted previously  a vie is consolidated by its primary beneficiary 
the primary beneficiary is defined as the entity that would absorb the majority of the vie s expected losses or be entitled to receive the majority of the vie s residual returns or both 
significant judgment was involved in determining the primary beneficiary of the joint venture 
we believe that olympus and cytori are de facto agents and  together  will absorb more than of the joint venture s expected losses and residual returns 
ultimately  we concluded that olympus  and not cytori  was the party most closely related with the joint venture and  hence  its primary beneficiary 
our conclusion was based on the following factors the business operations of the joint venture will be most closely aligned to those of olympus ie  the manufacture of devices 
olympus controls the board of directors  as well as the day to day operations of the joint venture  and therefore has the primary power to direct activities that could significantly impact economic performance 
had we consolidated the joint venture  though  there would be no effect on our net loss or shareholders equity at december  or for the year then ended 
however  certain balance sheet and income statement captions would have been presented in a different manner 
for instance  we would not have presented a single line item entitled investment in joint venture in our balance sheet but  instead  would have performed a line by line consolidation of each of the joint venture s accounts into our financial statements 
net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards we have established a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the realization of such assets 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
at such time as it is determined that it is more likely than not that deferred assets are realizable  the valuation allowance will be reduced 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of  as of december  to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets that may not be realized 
we increased our valuation allowance by approximately  during the year ended december  the valuation allowance includes approximately  related to stock option deductions  the benefit of which  if realized  will eventually be credited to equity and not to income 
at december   we had federal and state tax loss carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and respectively  if unused 
at december   we had federal and state tax credit carryforwards of approximately  and  respectively 
the federal credits will begin to expire in  if unused  and  of the state credits will begin to expire in if unused 
the remaining state credits carry forward indefinitely 
in addition  we had a foreign tax loss carryforward of  in japan   in italy   in switzerland  and  in india 
the internal revenue code limits the future availability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that arose prior to certain cumulative changes in a corporation s ownership resulting in a change of our control 
we have completed an ownership change analysis pursuant to irc section through april  we do not have any ownership change limitations based on this study 
we are in the process of updating this analysis through december  recent accounting pronouncements see notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein for disclosure and discussion of new accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates and in foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate exposure we are not subject to market risk due to fluctuations in interest rates on our long term obligations as they bear a fixed rate of interest 
our exposure relates primarily to short term investments  including funds classified as cash equivalents 
as of december   all excess funds were invested in money market funds and other highly liquid investments  therefore our interest rate exposure is not considered to be material 
foreign currency exchange rate exposure our exposure to market risk due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our activities in europe and japan 
transaction gains or losses resulting from cash balances and revenues have not been significant in the past and we are not engaged in any hedging activity in the euro  the yen or other currencies 
based on our cash balances and revenues derived from markets other than the united states for the year ended december   a hypothetical adverse change in the euro or yen against the us dollar would not result in a material foreign currency exchange loss 
consequently  we do not expect that reductions in the value of such sales denominated in foreign currencies resulting from even a sudden or significant fluctuation in foreign exchange rates would have a direct m aterial impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
notwithstanding the foregoing  the indirect effect of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may affect international demand for our products 
in addition  interest rate fluctuations may affect our customers buying patterns 
furthermore  interest rate and currency exchange rate fluctuations may broadly influence the united states and foreign economies resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
under our japanese thin film agreement with senko  we would receive payments in the nature of royalties based on senko s net sales  which would be yen denominated
