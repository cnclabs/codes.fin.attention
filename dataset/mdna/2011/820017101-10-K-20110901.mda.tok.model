the decrease in revenues is primarily attributable to decreased billings in the us government contract million and pharmaceutical million markets 
these decreases in billings were partially offset by increased billings in the professional million  home health care million  retail million  other million and assisted living hospitality million markets 
us government contract billings are associated with the company s contract with a major us government agency announced in february the current year billings were for maintenance and the prior year billings include i million recognized in the first half of fiscal year for the sale of the company s sharps mwms to this major us government agency and ii million recognized in the second half of fiscal year attributable to the transition from the product build out to the maintenance phase of the company s contract with the us government agency

the increase in billings in the home health care market is a result of increased sales to home health care related distributors addressing the growing trend of patient volumes in the home health care industry 
the increase in the retail market billings is due to the initial orders of the company s takeaway environmental return system envelope solution by three large retail pharmacy chains and several food and drug chains to address growing concerns regarding the hazards of unused medications in the home and environment 
the increase in the other category is a result of referrals from the company s strategic alliance with a leading hazardous waste solutions provider

the increase in professional market billings is due to the impact of the company s recently launched outbound sales initiative as well as physician  dental  and veterinary offices becoming aware through the efforts of the company and its strong distributor network of the significant cost advantage and the convenience of the sharps recovery system over the traditional pick up services 
the decrease in the health care market billings is related to the ordering patterns of the larger home health care customers as well as additional distributor incentives designed to drive future growth in this market

table of contents prospects for the future the company continues to take advantage of the many opportunities in the markets served as communities  consumers  government and health care and commercial organizations become more aware of the need for the proper treatment of medical sharps waste  used healthcare materials and used dispensed medications 
the centers for disease control and prevention the cdc and the epa estimate that there are over three billion used syringes disposed of annually outside of the hospital setting in the united states 
the company estimates that it would require to million sharps recovery system formerly sharps disposal by mail system products to properly dispose of all such syringes  which would equate to a market opportunity of billion 
there are an estimated  doctors  dentists  veterinarians  clinics  tattoo parlors and other businesses in the country that generate smaller quantities of medical waste  including used syringes 
these offices and facilities  which must demonstrate proper management of their medical waste  comprise a market opportunity of approximately million  based on estimates of using our solution offerings rather than the traditional pick up service in what we characterize as a regulated market 
additionally  an estimated of the four billion dispensed medication prescriptions go unused every year in the united states generating an estimated million pounds of unused medication waste 
the company estimated the market opportunity for the proper recovery and management of the unused medications to be at least billion per year 
the company continues to develop new solution offerings including the complete needle collection and disposal system designed for the traditional under served home self injector  the sharps medical waste management system  the takeaway line of products for unused medications including takeaway environmental return system  the medical professional takeaway recovery system and the rx takeaway recovery and reporting system which offers the collection  storage  audit  witnessed treatment and documentation of unused medications such as flu vaccines  tamiflu  and relenza 
these innovative product and service offerings allow us to gain further sales from existing customers as well as gain new customers who have a need for more comprehensive products 
the company continues to develop solution offerings designed to facilitate the proper and cost effective solutions for management of medical waste  used healthcare materials and unused dispensed medication to better serve our customers and the environment 
the company believes its future growth will be driven by  among other items i the convergence of issues regarding the environment  the cost of health care and changes in our health care delivery system and cost savings initiatives which influence the decision process of our customers  ii the effects of the company s extensive multi layered marketing and awareness efforts and iii the company s leadership position in the development and sales of products and services designed for the proper and cost effective solutions for management of medical waste  used healthcare materials and unused dispensed 
in august  the company introduced the complete needle collection and disposal system which is focused on the traditional under served home self injector required to regularly use needles or syringes for their health and well being  such as people with diabetes 
the complete needle collection and disposal system is actually two offerings in one 
first  the product provides the individual self injector with a reasonably priced containment solution designed to protect self injectors and their family members 
second  the product includes an optional disposal feature utilizing the usps designed to protect the individual s community  solid waste workers and the environment 
the solution offers significant convenience as it utilizes the same delivery channel  the retail pharmacy  that the self injector typically uses to obtain medications  for example  insulin  and needles or syringes 
the solution is also designed to enhance the interaction between the pharmacist and the individual thereby creating counseling opportunities and possibly better treatment outcomes 
the sharps mwms  a medical waste management system mwms  is a comprehensive medical waste and dispensed medication solution which includes an array of products and services necessary to effectively collect  store and treat medical waste and unused dispensed medication outside of the hospital or large health care facility setting 
in february  the company announced a million contract the us government contract award to provide its sharps mwms to a major us government agency 
the total contract is expected to be executed over a five year period one year plus four option years 
on february   the company received a purchase order for million million of which was recognized in fiscal year  million was recognized in the first half of fiscal year 
in january  sharps was awarded the first option year ending january  valued at approximately million and was recognized from february  through january  in january  sharps was awarded the second option year ending january  valued at approximately million and is to be recognized from february  through january  there is expected to be approximately million in revenue in calendar year for the maintenance component of the contract including million in the second half of calendar year the remaining two option years are expected to be approximately million per contract year 
although  the company believes the amounts above to be reasonable based upon the underlying contract and its current project plan  it makes no assurances regarding the actual recognition of revenue by fiscal year  which could vary significantly from that noted above 
the successful launch of this program demonstrates the attractiveness of our integrated  full service system that enables government agencies and commercial organizations to completely outsource the planning and execution of their emergency preparedness and disaster relief planning as it relates to medical waste handling and rapid response capabilities 
in addition to the sharps mwms  we continue to add similar full service  patient support programs with major pharmaceutical manufacturers whereby we provide a customized sharps recovery system formerly sharps disposal by mail system along with fulfillment  inventory management  storage and data services  as well as provide critical patient usage data that assists the manufacturers in assessing drug effectiveness and compliance 

table of contents in january  the company announced a pilot program with the united states department of veterans affairs va 
the program was launched within the va capitol health care network veterans integrated service network or visn  which provided quality health care for eligible veterans in maryland and portions of virginia  west virginia  and pennsylvania  as well as the district of columbia 
the pilot allowed each of the participating medical centers within the visn region  both inpatient and outpatient  to provide the sharps recovery system formerly known as the sharps disposal by mail system and the takeaway environmental return system solutions to their patients 
since its original launch  the pilot program expanded to include eight visn s encompassing twenty two states plus the district of columbia 
there are a total of twenty three visn s in the va system 
the visn network is part of the veterans health administration which encompasses the largest integrated health care system in the united states  consisting of medical centers  in addition to numerous community based outpatient clinics  community living centers and vet centers 
together these health care facilities provide comprehensive care to over million veterans each year 
as of june   the va pilot program is winding down as the va evaluates a broad roll out program that would make our solutions available across all visn s 
the company believes the pace of regulation of sharps and unused dispensed medications disposal is gaining momentum at both the state and federal level 
in december  the u 
s 
environmental protection agency epa issued its new guidelines for the proper disposal of medical sharps  revising the previous guidance that advised patients to dispose of used syringes in the trash see http www 
epa 
gov wastes nonhaz industrial medical med govt 
pdf 
additionally  in july both the states of california and massachusetts passed legislation designed to mandate appropriate disposal of sharps waste necessary to protect the general public and workers from potential exposure to contagious diseases and health and safety risks 
in april  the us senate re introduced a bill s 
which  if enacted  would provide for medicare reimbursement  under part d  for the safe and effective disposal of used needles and syringes 
to protect citizens and waste workers from needle stick injuries  eighteen states and the district of columbia covering of the us population restrict or have introduced legislation to restrict discarding used sharps into household trash and twenty nine states and the district of columbia covering of the us population have enacted or introduced legislation to regulate the disposal of consumer unused medications to reduce pollution of the environment 
as state and federal enforcement of these statutes increases  more companies will turn to solutions such as ours to help manage their medical waste and regulatory compliance 
the company believes it is well positioned to benefit given our strict adherence to established standards and extensive documentation and records 
the company s growth strategies are focused on the retail  pharmaceutical  professional and government both core and us government contract markets 
the company also serves the home health care  assisted living hospitality and other markets 
excluding the impact of the us government contract which had decreased billings due to the expected conversion from the production to the maintenance phase of the contract  customer billings grew due to increases in all core markets except for pharmaceutical  which can be variable based on the timing of programs 
although the pharmaceutical market did not experience growth in the year ended june   the company expects growth in the future from two new patient support program awards announced in august which will launch in the december quarter and roll out over the following six to nine month period

table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash flow cash and cash equivalents increased by million to million at june  from million at june  the increase in cash is due to the excess tax benefit of million from stock based award activity  partially offset by capital expenditures and additions to intangible assets of million 
accounts receivable increased by million to million at june  from million at june  the increase is due to higher billings in june prepaid and other current assets decreased by million to million at june  from million at june  the decrease is primarily due to a million federal income tax refund received in april property  plant and equipment  net decreased by million to million at june  from million at june  the decrease in property  plant and equipment is related to depreciation expense of million partially offset by capital expenditures of million

stockholders equity decreased by million to million at june  from million at june  this decrease is primarily attributable to a net loss for the year ended june  of million 
the impact was partially offset by  i the effect on equity credit of non cash stock based award expense of million and ii the excess tax benefits from stock based award activity of million 
off balance sheet arrangements the company entered into certain off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business that result in risks not directly reflected in our balance sheets 
the company s most significant off balance sheet transactions include commitments associated with non cancelable operating leases see note commitments and contingencies 
the company has other off balance sheet obligations involving letters of credit see note notes payable and long term debt 
the company entered into non cancelable operating leases for certain of our facility  vehicle and equipment needs 
these leases allow us to conserve cash by paying a monthly lease rental fee for use of facilities  vehicles and equipment rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
if we decide to cancel or terminate a lease before the end of its term  we would typically owe the lessor the remaining lease payments under the term of the lease 
the contractual obligations related to minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases as of june  are as follows in thousands twelve months ending june  total operating lease obligations 
table of contents credit facility the company s credit agreement the credit agreement with wells fargo bank  national association provides for a two year  million line of credit facility  the proceeds of which may be utilized for i working capital  ii capital expenditures  iii letters of credit up to  iv acquisitions up to  and v general corporate purposes 
as of june   the company had no outstanding borrowings  thousand in letters of credit outstanding  and million of credit available 
indebtedness under the credit agreement is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
borrowings bear interest at either i a fluctuating rate per annum equal to libor plus a margin of basis points or ii at the company s option  a fixed rate for a   or day period set at the option date s libor plus a margin of basis points 
any outstanding revolving loans  and accrued and unpaid interest  will be due and payable on july   the maturity date of the credit agreement 
the company pays a fee of per annum on the unused amount of the line of credit 
we estimate that the interest rate applicable to the borrowings under the credit agreement would be approximately as of june  the credit agreement contains affirmative and negative covenants that  among other things  require the company to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth of million and not exceed a ratio of liabilities to tangible net worth of to as of june   we are in compliance with all financial covenants 
the credit agreement also contains customary events of default 
upon the occurrence of an event of default that remains uncured after any applicable cure period  the lenders commitment to make further loans may terminate and the company may be required to make immediate repayment of all indebtedness to the lenders 
management believes that the company s current cash resources cash on hand and cash generated from operations along with its million line of credit with wells fargo bank will be sufficient to fund operations for the twelve months ending june  treatment facility the company s treatment facility in carthage  texas includes an incinerator which is currently permitted at a capacity of eleven tons per day 
in february  the company installed an autoclave system and technology capable of treating up to seven tons per day of medical waste at the same facility 
autoclaving is a process that treats medical waste with steam at high temperature and pressure to kill pathogens 
the autoclave is a technology that is a cost effective alternative to traditional incineration 
it also supplements the treatment capacity of the company and is an integral part of the treatment operations as the company utilizes both incineration and autoclave technology in its day to day operations 
the autoclave system is not impacted by the epa amended clean air act discussed below 
with the addition of the autoclave  the company believes it owns one of only approximately ten permitted commercial treatment facilities in the country capable of treating all types of medical waste 
in november and september  the epa and the texas commission on environmental quality promulgated new regulations under the clean air act and associated state statutes which will affect the operations of the incineration facility located in carthage  texas 
these regulations modify the emission limits and monitoring procedures required to operate an incineration facility 
the new rules will necessitate changes to the company s owned incinerator and pollution control equipment at the facility or require installation of an alternative treatment method to ensure compliance 
these regulations will also require the company to obtain a title v permit and conduct additional monitoring 
the company is required to comply with these new standards by the end of such changes will require the company to incur capital expenditures in order to meet the requirements of the regulations 
the company has studied these amended regulations and their options  and decided in the interim to move forward with the process of adding alternative technology  autoclaving  which meets the epa clean air act requirements  for medical waste disposal which became fully operational in february at its current facility in carthage  texas 
autoclaving is a process that treats regulated waste with steam at high temperature and pressure to kill pathogens 
combining the autoclaving with a shredding or grinder process allows the waste to be disposed in a landfill operation 
the company believes autoclaving is environmentally cleaner and a less costly method of treating medical waste than incineration 
due to its continued growth  the company anticipates that it will incur additional capital expenditures needed in order to meet the new air emission regulations 
the additional capital expenditures are not expected to exceed million 
the company expects capital expenditures related to these new regulations to be made by the end of the first half of fiscal year 
table of contents inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on the results of operations during the past three years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in fiscal year and beyond 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from product sales when goods are shipped or delivered  and title and risk of loss pass to the customer except for those sales via multiple deliverable arrangements 
provisions for certain rebates  product returns and discounts to customers are accounted for as reductions in sales in the same period the related sales are recorded 
product discounts granted are based on the terms of arrangements with direct  indirect and other market participants  as well as market conditions  including prices charged by competitors 
rebates are estimated based on contractual terms  historical experience  trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served 
the company recognizes revenue in accordance with guidance on revenue recognition of multiple element arrangements 
on july   the company adpoted asu no 
which further clarifies guidance on revenue recognition for multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  changing the way it allocated arrangement consideration to the separate units of accounting 
under this guidance  certain products offered by the company have revenue producing components that are recognized over multiple delivery points sharps recovery system formerly the sharps disposal by mail systems and various takeaway environmental return system referred to as mailbacks and sharps pump and asset return boxes  referred to as pump returns and can consist of up to three separate elements  or units of measure  as follows the sale of the compliance and container system  return transportation and treatment service 
prior to july   the individual fair value of the transportation and treatment services were determined by the sales price of the service offered by third parties  with the fair value of compliance and container being the residual value 
beginning july   under the relative selling price methodology  an estimated selling price is determined for all deliverables that qualify for separate units of accounting 
the actual consideration received in a multiple deliverable arrangement is then allocated to the units based on their relative sales price 
because an estimated selling price must be set for each unit  the residual method used previously by the company to allocate consideration to the compliance and container system is no longer allowed 
the selling price for the transportation revenue and the treatment revenue  which utilized third party evidence  did not change from the prior method 
the company estimated the selling price of the compliance and container system based on the product and services provided including compliance with local  state and federal laws  adherence to stringent manufacturing and testing requirements  safety to the patient and the community as well as storage and containment capabilities 
revenue for the sale of the compliance and container is recognized upon delivery to the customer  at which time the customer takes title and assumes risk of ownership 
transportation revenue is recognized when the customer returns the compliance and container system and the container has been received at the company s facility 
the compliance and container system is mailed or delivered by an alternative logistics provider to the company s facility 
treatment revenue is recognized upon the destruction or conversion and proof of receipt and treatment having been performed on the container 
since the transportation element and the treatment elements are undelivered services at the point of initial sale of the compliance and container  transportation and treatment revenue is deferred until the services are performed 
the current and long term portions of deferred revenues are determined through regression analysis and historical trends 
furthermore  through regression analysis of historical data  the company has determined that a certain percentage of all compliance and container systems sold may not be returned 
accordingly  a portion of the transportation and treatment elements are recognized at the point of sale 
the company has calculated the change in revenue assigned to each of the units of accounting under the relative selling price methodology as compared to using the residual allocation method and determined that the change is not material 
the company has determined that the implementation of asu no 
did not have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements when compared to its previous revenue recognition methodology
