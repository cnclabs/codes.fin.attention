our discussion includes forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under the risk factors  cautionary notice regarding forward looking statements and business sections in this registration statement 
we use terms such as anticipate  estimate  plan  project  continuing  ongoing  expect  believe  intend  may  will  should  could  and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
general sk wfoe and tianjin shengkai  the entities through which we run our operations  are prominent ceramic valve manufacturers 
we have more than years of experience and possess a unique method for creating ceramic valves 
we believe that the company is one of the few ceramic valve manufacturers in the world with research and development  engineering  and production capacity for structural ceramics and is able to produce large sized ceramic valves with calibers of mm or more 
the company product portfolio includes a broad range of valves that are sold throughout the prc  to europe  north america  middle east and other countries in the asia pacific region 
the company has over customers  and is the only ceramic valve supplier qualified to supply sinopec 
the company joined the supply network of china national petroleum corporation cnpc in and subsequently received a cnpc certificate of material supplier for valve products in results of operations comparison of the years ended june  and revenue revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was  an increase of  or from  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to our continuous marketing efforts  increased customer demand and expanded production capacity during the fiscal year ended june  the expansion in production capacity was due to the increase in our equipment and more operation shifts at the old facility and commencement of operations at our new manufacturing facility in mid september  offset by disruptions caused by the relocation of our production facility from the old plant to the new plant in september the new facility increased our total production capacity to  sets of ceramic valves per year based on a one shift operation schedule 
during the second half of the fiscal year ended june   we added additional shifts to increase our capacity output 
total ceramic valves output for the fiscal year ended june  reached  sets  compared with only  sets for the fiscal year ended june  ceramic valve is a relatively new technology with a very low market penetration rate compared with traditional metal valves which are currently prevalent in market 
demand for the company s ceramic valves had been growing because of the durability and reasonable pricing of our products 
approximately of our source of revenue came from customers in the electric power  petrochemical and chemical industries for the fiscal year ended june   compared with for the fiscal year ended june  the electric power industry still contributes significantly to our revenue  accounting for approximately of total revenue for the fiscal year ended june   compared with for the fiscal year ended june  revenue from the electric power industry was  for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of approximately  or from  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to the broadening of our customer base and repeated orders from existing customers 
approximately of revenue from the electric power industry for the fiscal year was generated from new customer accounts 
revenue from the petrochemical and chemical industry  our biggest potential market  accounted for approximately of total revenue for the fiscal year ended june   compared with for the fiscal year ended june  the revenue from the petrochemical and chemical industry was  for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of  or from  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily due to our continuous efforts to market our products to the petrochemical and chemical industry 
we focused more marketing efforts on the petrochemical and chemical industries because most of their production and supply processes involve highly corrosive and abrasive media or other severe conditions  and therefore we believe that our ceramic valves are a good fit for these sectors because of their superior durability 
approximately of revenue from the petrochemical and chemical industry for the year was generated from twenty new customer accounts 
revenue from other industries  including the aluminum and metallurgy industries  accounted for approximately of total revenue for the fiscal year ended june   compared with for the fiscal year ended june  the revenue for other industries was  for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of  or from approximately  for the fiscal year ended june  the rapid growth in revenue from the other industries was primarily due to the mandatory application of dry dedust technique  as mandated in the environmental protection guide for developing circular economy in iron and steel promulgated by the ministry of environment protection of prc in march to replace the traditional wet technique  used in blast furnace gas cleaning in the iron and steel industry 
iron and steel mills introduced new blast furnace gas cleaning systems  which create a highly abrasive working environment for the valves 
accordingly  there was a greater need to replace their old valves with more durable ones 
approximately of revenue from the other industries for the year was generated from eleven new customer accounts 
in recent months  because of the heightened suspicions on the integrity of prc companies  enquiries into the company s business and domestic customers mounted by certain shareholders and interested parties without the company s approval or endorsement have resulted in severely damaged relations with some of the company s important domestic customers 
this has resulted in considerable loss of business since june  and a higher turnover in the company s sales agents and representatives 
some of the company s other customers have seized this opportunity to demand price cuts from the company 
meanwhile  some of the company s competitors also have seized this opportunity to take away its customers 
in response to this situation  management of the company has decided to phase out its less profitable domestic market segments including the electric power market and focus on expanding its presence in the more profitable domestic and foreign oil and chemical industries where ceramic valve products typically command higher prices than the domestic prc market 
in the immediate future  we expect revenues for the quarter ended september  to fall by as much as compared with the quarter ended june  gross profit gross profit for the fiscal year ended june  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase was primarily attributable to the revenue increase 
the gross profit margin for the fiscal year ended june  was  compared to for the fiscal year ended june  included in total sales for the fiscal were approximately million in sales of ceramic valve components and some metal valves  which had a gross margin closer to the industry norm in prc and much lower than our higher value added ceramic valve products  dragging down the average gross margin in the year 
these orders for valve components and metal valves were made together with orders for ceramic valves as a package deal from a few customers 
such a large quantity of valve component and metal valves sales is not expected to recur on a regular basis in future 
the decrease in gross margin between the two comparison periods was also attributed to increase in depreciation expenses and material costs 
for the fiscal year ended june   new fixed assets of approximately million was added to plant and equipment 
the corresponding new depreciation expenses recorded in cost of goods sold was approximately million for the year 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  prices for steel raw materials and steel die casting components had increased by approximately compared with previous quarters 
due to the anticipated drop in sales revenue as discussed above  we estimate that our gross margin for the quarter ended september  would continue to drop to around because of the fixed nature of depreciation and other expenses and loss of bulk discount in procurement 
selling expenses selling expenses for the fiscal year ended june  was  an increase of  or  from  for the fiscal year ended june  the major component of selling expenses was commissions paid to agents for introducing new sales  which were approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of approximately million or from approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  selling expenses as a percentage of total sales revenue decreased to for the fiscal year ended june  from for the fiscal year ended june   primarily attributable to the revenue increase and that most of other selling expenses are relatively fixed in nature 
since commission  the major component of selling expenses  is a fixed percentage of revenue  we expect selling expenses for the future quarters would basically decrease proportionately with the downturn in business 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative g a expenses for the fiscal year ended june  were  a decrease of  or compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  the decrease was primarily attributable to the inclusion of a non cash stock compensation expense of approximately million in the g a expenses for the fiscal year ended june   resulting from the return of shares of common stock to the company chief executive officer and principal shareholder  because the company achieved the financial performance thresholds for the fiscal years ended june  and  pursuant to the securities escrow agreements in the june and july financings and amendments thereto 
included in g a expenses for the fiscal year ended june  was a non cash charge of  which was the share based compensation costs on i the options to an advisor and to independent directors  management and key employees issued on march  and june   under the company s incentive stock plan  and ii the stock awards to management  key employees and consultants issued in march and june   under the company s incentive stock plan 
the non cash share based compensation costs included in the g a expenses for the fiscal year ended june  was  g a expenses excluding the non cash items for the fiscal year ended june  were  an increase of  or compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in g a excluding the non cash items expenses for the fiscal year june  over the fiscal year ended june  was attributable to the increase in depreciation costs from  to  as a result of the construction of the new headquarters  traveling expenses  cash compensation to independent directors and management staff due to new appointments and hirings  as well as expenses incurred in our us capital market related activities  such as nasdaq listing fees and costs for participation in investment conferences 
the amortization of land use rights and other intangible assets for the fiscal year ended june  was  an increase of  or compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  changes in fair value of instruments for the fiscal year ended june   the company incurred non cash gain in an aggregate amount of approximately million related to its issuance of series a warrants and series a convertible preferred stock in the private placements in june and july   as well as issuance of warrants to underwriters in the public offerings in november and december  pursuant to provision of fasb asc topic  derivative and hedging asc 
the accounting treatment of the warrants resulted from the difference between the company functional currency in renminbi and the denominated currency of the strike price of the warrants in us dollars 
the accounting treatment of the preferred stock resulted from a down round provision providing anti dilution protection to the preferred stockholders 
both warrants and the embedded conversion option of series a convertible preferred stock are recorded as liabilities measured at fair value with changes in their fair value recognized in earnings for the fiscal year ended june  fair value of the instruments was primarily a function of the price of our common stock 
a decrease in our stock price over the year resulted in a decrease in fair value of the instruments  which are liabilities  hence a gain was recognized for the reporting period 
for the fiscal year ended june   however  the company recognized a non cash loss of approximately million  due to the increase in our stock price over that year  resulting in an increase in fair value of the instruments 
provision for income taxes provision for income tax for the fiscal year ended june  was  an increase of  or from  for the fiscal year ended june  excluding the approximately million share based compensation cost and the approximately million gain from changes in fair value of instruments  adjusted income before taxes was approximately million for the fiscal year ended june  compared with approximately million for the fiscal year ended june   after adjusting for the approximately million stock compensation expense  approximately million share based compensation cost  and approximately million loss from changes in fair value of instruments 
the increase in provision for income taxes was not proportional to the growth in the adjusted income before taxes  attributable to the new preferential income tax rate in calendar in april  tianjin shengkai  the company s operating entity in tianjin  prc  was newly awarded the status of high technology enterprise for the calendar years through hence tianjin shengkai enjoys a preferential enterprise income tax rate of starting from january  through december   and will receive a refund for the income taxes paid at the standard tax rate for the calendar year the applicable income tax rate was for the period from july  through december  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalent our cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the fiscal year ended june  was  and increased to  by the end of the period  an increase of  or 
the increase was primarily attributable to the net proceeds from the public offering closed by the end of the calendar year and internal cash flows generated from operations  offset by progressive payments made for our recently completed new manufacturing facility and headquarters building 
we believe that after taking into account of our current cash position and cash generated from operating activities  we have adequate operating funds to sustain working capital  capital expenditures and milestone payments for the next twelve months 
from time to time  we may identify new expansion opportunities  research and development projects and significant marketing initiatives for which there will be a need to use cash 
we manage our cash based on thorough consideration of our corporate strategy  business environment as well as the macro economic situation 
factors we take into account when managing our cash include interest rates  foreign currency fluctuation as well as the flexibility in executing our corporate strategy 
net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was  for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of  or from  for the comparable period in fiscal the adjusted net income  after deducting the non cash gain from changes in fair value of instruments and adding back the non cash share based compensation cost  was  for the fiscal year ended june   an increase of  or from  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase in net cash inflow from operations was primarily attributable to the higher adjusted net income  in spite of larger working capital used between the two comparable periods in fiscal and fiscal  as reflected by increased cash used in accounts receivable  notes receivable and other receivables  notes payable and advances from customers over the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities was  for the fiscal year ended june   compared to  for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of  or 
the change was primarily attributable to less capital expenditures incurred during the fiscal year ended june  compared to the fiscal year ended june net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was  for the fiscal year ended june   attributable to the proceeds from issuance of common stock in the public offering during the year  net of offering costs 
for the fiscal year ended june   the fund of  was proceeds from exercise of warrants in the year 
capital expenditures in october  we successfully won a bid on a land use right over a plot of land of approximately  square meters in size 
the land is located in tianjin  prc and the bid price was approximately million rmb million 
the formal contract was signed with the government on january   with the company due to pay the bid price in full by march  the land was purchased to construct corporate headquarters and to build a new manufacturing facility to expand our production capacity 
expenditures committed under related construction contracts totaled  rmb  of which  rmb  had been paid as of june  the remaining balance of  rmb  will substantially be settled after completion of inspection and final acceptance of the construction project by relevant government authorities  with certain amount to be held from payment as warranty deposit till approximately one year after such final acceptance 
certain equipment and machinery contracts for the above mentioned newly completed manufacturing facility have also been executed  total amount of which was approximately  rmb  of which  rmb  had been paid as of june  the remaining balance of  rmb  primarily represented the amount held as warranty deposit till approximately one year after installation 
expenditures committed under certain utility installation and related auxiliary engineering projects totaled  rmb  which had been fully paid as of june  trends in response to the recent business disruptions and changes in the global ceramic valves industry as described above  management of the company has decided to phase out its less profitable domestic market segments including the electric power market and focus on expanding its presence in the more profitable domestic and foreign oil and chemical industries where ceramic valve products typically command higher prices than the domestic chinese market 
the company plans to substantially raise prices to match industry levels and to reflect its superior product quality 
the company also expects to streamline operations through headcount reduction and other cost saving measures to conserve capital and reduce the impact of any revenue loss during this transition 
finally  the company plans to leverage its self developed ceramic material technologies to continue in house and joint research and development of innovative and superior performance products for the international oil and chemical markets and commit its resources to expanding the acceptance of its products overseas 
as such  we expect that in the immediately following quarter ended september   revenue from the electric power industry would significantly drop  and major contribution to our sales would be from the petrochemical and chemical industry 
we estimate that for the quarter ended september   total revenue would fall by as much as sequentially compared with the quarter ended june   and gross margin would drop to around 
we expect the company to run with positive but significantly reduced cash flow from operations 
such decrease may persist until our marketing and sales efforts to some new customers and projects pay off  and the expansion in the international market picks up meaningfully 
successful penetration into international oil and chemical markets would also require the company to obtain various certifications  including but not limited to iso and ohsas and other firm specific supplier qualifications  which will take time to go through various application procedures  efforts in new product development and investment in additional or different equipment 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material or significant impact on our revenue or our results of operations 
contractual obligations we have certain fixed contractual obligations and commitments that include future estimated payments 
changes in our business needs  cancellation provisions  changing interest rates  and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates 
we cannot provide certainty regarding the timing and amounts of payments 
we have presented below a summary of the most significant assumptions used in our determination of amounts presented in the tables  in order to assist in the review of this information within the context of our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of june   and the effect these obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods
