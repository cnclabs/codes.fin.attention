table of contents part i item business we operate in two business segments  equipment leasing equipment leasing and equipment manufacturing 
our equipment manufacturing segment is conducted by our seamap subsidiaries and  therefore  is referred to in this form k as our seamap segment 
mitcham industries  inc mii  a texas corporation  was incorporated in our equipment leasing segment is engaged in the leasing of seismic equipment to companies in the oil and gas industry throughout the world 
we conduct our leasing business through mii  through our wholly owned subsidiaries and through our branches in colombia and peru 
we are also engaged in the sale of new and used seismic equipment and in the design  manufacture and sale of marine seismic equipment 
the subsidiaries that conduct our leasing business are mitcham canada ltd mcl  seismic asia pacific pty ltd 
sap  mitcham seismic eurasia llc mse  and absolute equipment solutions  inc aes 
we acquired aes in march aes  which is located in calgary  alberta  canada  produces  leases and sells heli pickers and related equipment 
this equipment is utilized by seismic contractors and helicopter operators to more efficiently and safely deploy and retrieve seismic equipment in the field 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for information about the acquisition of aes 
our equipment leasing segment also sells new and used seismic equipment from time to time and  through sap  leases and sells oceanographic and hydrographic equipment  primarily in the pacific rim 
our seamap segment  or seamap  is engaged in the design  production and sale of marine seismic equipment 
the operations of this segment are conducted through wholly owned subsidiaries  seamap uk ltd seamap uk and seamap pte 
ltd seamap singapore 
for additional information about our business segments  including related financial information  see note to our consolidated financial statements and item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
we lease and sell geophysical and other equipment used primarily by seismic data acquisition contractors to perform seismic data acquisition surveys on land  in transition zones marsh and shallow water areas and marine areas 
we conduct our operations on a worldwide basis and believe that we are the world s largest independent lessor of seismic equipment 
we believe that our competitors  in general  do not have as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool as ours  as broad of geographic presence as we do and do not have similar exclusive lease referral agreements with seismic equipment suppliers 
prior to the fall of  we had experienced an extended period of growth in our business  as had most businesses involved in providing seismic related goods and services 
this growth was  we believe  driven primarily by worldwide oil and gas exploration activity  which was in turn driven by the demand for oil and gas and historically high prices for oil and natural gas 
with the global economic and financial crisis that arose in the fall of  we saw demand for our products decline  especially within certain markets such as north america and the commonwealth of independent states cis  which consists of former soviet republics 
the onslaught of the global recession and the resulting decline in demand for oil and gas  coupled with a relatively high supply of those commodities  resulted in a dramatic decline in the price for oil and natural gas 
this  we believe  resulted in a dramatic reduction in oil and gas exploration activity and  therefore  a corresponding decline in demand for seismic related goods and services 
in fiscal  we began to see a recovery in seismic exploration activity and  therefore  an increase in demand for our goods and services 
we believe that this recovery has been driven in large part by the recovery of global oil prices 
while natural gas prices in north america have generally not recovered  there has been renewed activity in exploration for natural gas surrounding various unconventional gas reservoirs  commonly referred to as shale plays 
there also appears to be growing interest in similar natural gas prospects in other parts of the world  such as eastern europe 
while the oil and gas industry has been  and we expect will be  subject to significant cyclicality  we believe that our business will benefit from a long term demand for oil and gas 
our equipment is utilized in a variety of geographic regions throughout the world  which are described in customers  sales  backlog and marketing 

table of contents we own a variety of technologically advanced equipment acquired from the leading seismic manufacturers 
our lease pool includes many types of equipment used in seismic data acquisition  including various electronic components of land  transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition systems  geophones and cables  earth vibrators  peripheral equipment  survey and other equipment 
the majority of our seismic equipment lease pool is provided by the sercel subsidiaries of compagnie generale de geophysique veritas sercel 
however  we also purchase equipment from a number of other equipment manufacturers  including ion geophysical corporation ion  oyo geospace corporation oyo and inova geophysical equipment limited  an affiliate of ion 
at january   approximately of our equipment lease pool  on a cost basis  consisted of seismic recording channels and related equipment  with the remainder consisting of geophones  compressors  energy source controllers and other peripheral equipment 
for the past several years  we have had a series of supply and exclusive lease referral agreements with sercel  which we believe have provided us with certain competitive advantages  primarily due to preferential pricing and expedited delivery arrangements under the agreements 
under these agreements  we have been the exclusive worldwide short term leasing representative for certain products 
in september  we renewed our agreement with sercel 
see key supplier agreements the sercel lease agreement for further information about this agreement 
we lease our equipment on a short term basis  generally for two to six months  to seismic contractors who need additional capacity to complete a seismic survey 
certain equipment that is used in vertical seismic profiling  or downhole operations  is generally leased to oil field service companies and generally for shorter periods ranging from a few days to two weeks 
short term leasing agreements enable our customers to achieve operating and capital investment efficiencies 
a typical seismic crew uses a wide variety of equipment to perform seismic data acquisition surveys 
our customers may lease a small amount of equipment to expand an existing crew s capabilities or a complete seismic data acquisition system to equip an entire crew 
demand for short term seismic equipment leases is affected by many factors  including i the highly variable size and technological demands of individual seismic surveys  ii seasonal weather patterns and sporadic demand for seismic surveys in certain regions  iii the term of the lease and iv the cost of seismic equipment 
we believe these factors allow seismic contractors to use short term seismic equipment leasing as a cost effective alternative to purchasing additional equipment 
our equipment lease rates vary according to an item s expected useful life  utilization  acquisition cost and the term of the lease 
sap sells equipment  consumables  systems integration  engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to companies in the seismic  hydrographic  oceanographic  environmental and defense industries throughout southeast asia and australia 
mii and mcl also sell a broad range of used seismic equipment on a worldwide basis 
aes owns certain patent rights related to  and produces  leases and sells  heli pickers and related equipment to the seismic industry 
we believe that aes is the dominant provider of this equipment to the seismic industry 
seamap designs  manufactures and sells a broad range of proprietary products for the seismic  hydrographic and offshore industries 
seamap s primary products include the gunlink seismic source acquisition and control systems  which provide operators of marine seismic surveys more precise control of energy sources  and the buoylink rgps tracking system  which is used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers 
we believe that seamap  with the gunlink product line  is now the primary provider of new energy source controllers in the seismic industry 
for information regarding our net income and total assets by segment  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
business strategy our business strategy is to meet the needs of the seismic industry by leasing a wide range of equipment and to provide technologically advanced solutions for marine seismic applications 
to accomplish this  we have identified the following major objectives provide a technologically advanced seismic equipment lease pool 
we intend to maintain the size and diversity of our equipment lease pool 
we believe that the availability of a large and diverse seismic 
table of contents equipment lease pool encourages seismic data acquisition contractors and oil field service providers to lease  rather than purchase  such equipment  due to the capital and operating efficiencies provided by short term leases 
continue to expand international operations 
we intend to continue to expand our international leasing activities in new geographic areas  including the cis  south america  europe  the middle east and north africa 
we believe there are significant opportunities to continue to expand our international leasing and sales activities 
we believe that we can conduct business in wide ranging geographic areas from our existing facilities 
however  for legal  tax or operational reasons  we may decide in the future to establish facilities in additional locations 
we generally expect to establish any such facilities through a green field approach  but we may consider making selective acquisitions from time to time 
maintain alliances with major seismic equipment manufacturers 
our relationships with leading seismic equipment manufacturers  particularly sercel  allow us to expand our equipment lease pool through favorable pricing and delivery terms 
we believe these relationships provide a competitive advantage 
pursue additional business development opportunities 
we regularly evaluate opportunities to expand our business activities within the oil service industry  particularly in the seismic sector 
these opportunities could include the introduction of new products or services or the acquisition of existing businesses 
seismic technology and the oil service industry seismic surveys are a principal source of information used by oil and gas companies to identify geological conditions that are favorable for the accumulation of oil and gas and to evaluate the potential for successful drilling  development and production of oil and gas 
seismic technology has been used by the oil and gas industry since the s  and has advanced significantly with improvements in computing and electronic technologies 
beginning in the early s  the oil and gas industry significantly expanded its use of d seismic data 
d seismic data provides a more comprehensive subsurface image and is believed to have contributed to improved drilling success rates  particularly in mature oil and gas basins such as those in north america 
additionally  d seismic data continues to be used in many areas where d data acquisition is cost prohibitive or logistical access is limited 
oil and gas exploration companies utilize seismic data generated from the use of digital seismic systems and peripheral equipment in determining optimal locations for drilling oil and gas wells  in the development of oil and gas reserves and in reservoir management for the production of oil and gas 
a complete digital seismic data acquisition system generally consists of i a central electronics unit that records and stores digital data ceu  ii seismic recording channel boxes that contain from one to eight seismic channels channel boxes  iii geophones  or seismic sensors  iv energy sources including dynamite  air guns or earth vibrators that create the necessary acoustic wave to be recorded  v cables that transmit digital seismic data from the channel boxes to the ceu  vi geographic survey equipment  vii drilling equipment used in the seismic survey and viii other peripheral  or accessory  equipment 
in certain applications  specialized seismic recording devices are deployed vertically within a well bore 
multiple recording channels  or levels are generally deployed within a given well and are referred to as downhole or vsp vertical seismic profiling tools 
these applications are used to provide additional data points in a traditional seismic survey  to monitor and analyze reservoir properties  and to monitor and analyze fluid treatment operations  as well as a variety of other uses 
in seismic data acquisition  an acoustic wave is generated at or below the earth s surface through the discharge of compressed air  the detonation of small explosive charges or the use of large mechanical vibrators 
as the acoustic wave travels through the earth  it is partially reflected by the underlying rock layers and the reflected energy is captured by sensors  such as geophones  which are situated at intervals along paths from the point of acoustical impulse 
the resulting signals are then transmitted to the channel boxes  which convert the signals from analog to digital data and transmit this data via cable to the ceu 
the ceu stores the seismic data on magnetic tape  disk or other recording media for processing 
the digital data is then input into a specialized seismic processing system that uses sophisticated computer software programs to enhance the recorded signal and produce an image of 
table of contents the subsurface strata 
by interpreting seismic data  oil and gas exploration companies create detailed maps of exploration prospects and oil and gas reservoirs 
historically  a d seismic survey was the standard data acquisition technique used to map geologic formations over a broad area 
d seismic data can be visualized as a single vertical plane of subsurface information 
data gathered from a d seismic survey is best visualized as a cube of information that can be sliced into numerous planes  providing different views of a geologic structure with much higher resolution than is available with traditional d seismic survey techniques 
d seismic surveys generally require a larger amount of equipment than d surveys 
by using a greater number of channels and flexible configuration  d seismic data provides more extensive and detailed information regarding the subsurface geology than d data 
as a result  d data allows the geophysicists interpreting the data to more closely select the optimal location of a prospective drill site or define an oil and gas reservoir 
in the exploration and development process  oil and gas companies establish requirements for seismic data acquisition programs based on their technical objectives 
because of the expense associated with drilling oil and gas wells  decisions regarding whether or where to drill are critical to the overall process 
since d seismic data increases drilling success rates and reduces costs  we believe that d seismic surveys are now predominant 
as a result of the increasing requirements for this higher resolution data  which in turn requires additional channels to collect and transmit data  seismic data acquisition systems have been expanding in size during the past several years 
industry advances include the use of high resolution d  three component geophones d c  which enhance the d image of the sub surface  and time lapse d seismic techniques  where surveys are periodically reacquired to allow the monitoring of producing oil and gas fields for optimal production and reserve recovery 
these and other technical advances have contributed to increased drilling success rates and reduced oil and gas finding costs 
with the expanded use of seismic technology  particularly d seismic surveys  the size of data acquisition surveys has increased substantially in the past several years 
demand for higher resolution data  larger surveys and more rapid completion of such surveys now requires seismic contractors to use data acquisition systems with a greater number of seismic recording channels 
additionally  the size of seismic surveys varies significantly  requiring frequent changes in the configuration of equipment and crews used for seismic surveys 
as a result of these changes  the number of seismic survey channels has increased from smaller d surveys  which typically averaged channels  to larger d surveys  which today average more than  channels and sometimes use as many as  channels 
we believe that many seismic contractors will continue to meet changes in equipment needs by leasing incremental equipment to expand crew size as necessary  thereby reducing the substantial capital expenditures required to purchase such equipment 
seismic surveys utilizing d  d or d techniques require essentially the same equipment 
the manner in which the equipment is deployed and the resulting data analyzed differs  however 
accordingly  our equipment can generally be utilized in d  d and d seismic surveys 
since d and d seismic surveys generally utilize significantly more equipment than d seismic surveys  the potential to lease our seismic equipment has increased from earlier periods 
business and operations equipment leasing 
we own a comprehensive lease pool of seismic equipment for short term leasing to our customers  who are primarily seismic data acquisition contractors and oil field service providers in the case of downhole equipment 
we lease this equipment multiple times until the earlier of the end of its useful life or its sale 
our equipment leasing services generally include the lease of the various components of seismic data acquisition systems and related equipment to meet a customer s job specifications 
these specifications frequently vary as to the number of required recording channels  geophones  energy sources eg  earth vibrators and other equipment 
our customers generally lease seismic equipment to supplement their own inventory of recording channels and related equipment 
our land equipment lease pool includes a total of over  seismic recording land channels each channel capable of electronically converting seismic data from analog to digital format and transmitting the digital data  
table of contents geophones and cables  and other peripheral equipment 
our lease pool of marine seismic equipment includes more than kilometers of streamers recording channels that are towed behind a vessel  air compressors  air guns  streamer positioning equipment  energy source controllers and other equipment 
our lease pool of downhole equipment includes approximately levels of downhole seismic tools 
our lease pool equipment is manufactured by leading seismic equipment manufacturers and is widely used in the seismic industry 
our marine lease pool includes energy source controllers and rgps tracking systems that are manufactured by our seamap segment 
our equipment leases generally have terms of two to six months  a few days to two weeks in the case of downhole equipment  and are typically renewable following the initial rental period 
our equipment lease rates vary according to an item s expected useful life  utilization  initial cost and the term of the lease 
we provide maintenance of our leased equipment during the lease term for malfunctions due to failure of material and parts and will provide replacement equipment  as necessary 
in addition  we provide field technical support services when requested by our customers 
the customer is responsible for the cost of repairing equipment damages other than normal wear and tear and replacing destroyed or lost equipment under the terms of our standard lease agreements 
the customer is also normally responsible for the costs of shipping the equipment from and to one of our facilities and is responsible for all taxes  other than income taxes  related to the lease of the equipment 
the customer is required to obtain and maintain insurance for the replacement value of the equipment and a specified minimum amount of general liability insurance 
while it is our general practice to lease our seismic equipment on a monthly basis  in certain circumstances we lease equipment on a day rate usage basis 
seismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions 
in canada and russia  a significant percentage of the seismic survey activity occurs in the winter months  from december through march or april 
during the months in which the weather is warmer  certain areas are not accessible to trucks  earth vibrators and other heavy equipment because of the unstable terrain 
in other areas of the world  such as southeast asia and the pacific rim  periods of heavy rain  known as monsoons  can impair seismic operations 
we are able  in many cases  to transfer our equipment from one region to another in order to deal with seasonal demand and to increase our equipment utilization 
for additional information about the impact of seasonality and weather  see item a risk factors 
upon completion of a lease  the equipment must generally be returned to one of our facilities for inspection  testing and  if necessary  repair 
while the customer is normally responsible for the costs of shipping and repairs  during this time the equipment is not available for lease to another customer 
therefore  managing this process and the utilization of the equipment is an important aspect of our operations 
given the short term of most of our leases  we believe that the highest achievable annual utilization for most of our equipment is approximately 
however  many factors can affect this utilization rate  including the term of our leases  the shipping time required to return equipment to one of our facilities  the time required to inspect  test and repair equipment after return from a lease and the demand for the equipment 
historically  the majority of the inspection  testing and repair have been done in our huntsville  texas or calgary  alberta facilities 
in recent years  however  we have added inspection and testing capabilities to our facilities in ufa  bashkortostan  russia and singapore 
with the establishment of our branch operations in colombia and peru  we also added inspection  test and repair capabilities in those countries 
we believe that by expanding these capabilities we have been able to more effectively utilize our equipment and reduce costs associated with these operations  although it is not possible to quantify the effect of any such improvement 
the incremental cost for these additional facilities was not material 
lease pool equipment sales 
on occasion  we sell used equipment from our lease pool  normally in response to specific customer demand or to declining demand for rental of specific equipment 
used equipment sold from our lease pool can have a wide range of gross margins depending upon the amount of depreciation that has been recorded on the item 
when used equipment is sold from our lease pool  the net book value plus any cost associated with the sale is recorded to cost of goods sold 
sales of our lease pool equipment typically occur as opportunities arise and do not have a significant seasonal aspect 
sales of lease pool equipment amounted to approximately million  million and million in each of the three fiscal years ended january   and  respectively 
we typically do not seek to sell our lease pool equipment 
however  we will evaluate any opportunities 
table of contents for the sale of equipment from our lease pool  and based upon our evaluation  may sell additional equipment 
such sales of lease pool equipment could be material 
other equipment sales 
the other equipment sales included in our equipment leasing segment fall into two broad categories sales of new seismic equipment 
on occasion  we will sell new seismic equipment in response to a specific demand from a customer 
these sales are made in cooperation with our suppliers of lease pool equipment 
sale of heli pickers and related equipment by aes 
aes sells a variety of equipment and supplies utilized in the deployment and retrieval of seismic equipment by helicopter 
certain of this equipment is produced by aes and is the subject of certain patent rights that aes owns

seamap s design operations are located in the united kingdom and in singapore and its manufacturing facilities are located in singapore 
key supplier agreements the sercel lease agreement in september  we entered into a new exclusive equipment lease agreement with sercel the exclusive equipment lease agreement  which replaced an agreement that expired in december under the current agreement  we are  with some exceptions  the exclusive worldwide authorized lessor for sercel s dsu xl three component digital sensors and the exclusive authorized lessor for sercel s downhole seismic tools in north and south america through december under the agreement  we agreed not to offer financing leases or leases with terms greater than one year related to the exclusive products as defined in the agreement without sercel s prior consent 
sercel agreed to refer any inquires for short term rentals of the exclusive products for use within the exclusive territory as defined in the agreement to us and to not recommend any competitor of ours as a source of such rentals 
sercel and we agreed to cooperate in the promotion and marketing of the exclusive products 
the agreement provides that sercel grant us specified pricing for the purchase of the exclusive products and certain other products 
in return  we agreed to purchase a total of  stations  or  channels  of dsu xl three component digital sensors and levels of downhole tools by december  as of january   we had purchased  stations of dsu xl and approximately levels of downhole tools pursuant to this agreement 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information regarding our plans to meet these purchase obligations

in december  seamap acquired all of the capital stock of tanglesolve 
at the time  tanglesolve s only material assets were the cooperation agreement and the intellectual property related to the gunlink software 
in connection with this transaction  seamap entered into a new cooperation agreement with the former shareholders of tanglesolve whereby they provide certain on going support services 
in december  the cooperation agreement was extended through december by mutual consent  as provided for in the agreement 
customers  sales  backlog and marketing our lease customers generally are seismic data acquisition contractors 
we typically have a small number of lease customers  the composition of which changes yearly as leases are negotiated and concluded and equipment needs vary 
as of january   we had approximately lease customers with active leases of various lengths  but typically for less than a year 
we do not maintain a backlog of orders relating to our equipment leasing segment 
as of january   our seamap segment had a backlog of orders amounting to approximately million  compared to million as of january  we expect all of these orders to be fulfilled during our fiscal year ending january  we participate in both domestic and international trade shows and expositions to inform the industry of our products and services and we advertise in major geophysical trade journals

the loss of any of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
no other customer accounted for or more of our revenues during these periods 
competition our major competitors are the major seismic equipment manufacturers who sell equipment on financed terms and seismic contractors who might have excess equipment available for lease from time to time 
we face lesser competition from several companies that engage in seismic equipment leasing  but this competition has historically been fragmented and our competitors have not had as extensive a seismic equipment lease pool nor as wide geographic presence as we do 
we compete for seismic equipment leases on the basis of i price and delivery  ii variety and availability of both peripheral seismic equipment and complete data acquisition systems and iii length of lease term 
we believe that our infrastructure and broad geographic presence also provide a major competitive advantage by contributing to our operational efficiencies 
we compete in the used equipment sales market with a broad range of seismic equipment owners  including seismic data acquisition contractors  who use and eventually dispose of seismic equipment 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources than our own 
suppliers we have several suppliers of seismic equipment for our lease pool 
we acquire the majority of our seismic lease pool equipment from sercel 
however  we also acquire lease pool equipment from a number of other suppliers including ion and oyo 
management believes that our current relationships with our suppliers are satisfactory 
for the years ended january   and  approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues were generated from the rental of products we acquired from sercel

environmental regulation we are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations pertaining to protection of the environment and the manner in which chemicals and materials used in our manufacturing processes are handled and wastes generated from such operations are disposed 
we have established and implemented proactive environmental procedures for the management of these chemicals and materials as well as the handling and recycling or disposal of wastes resulting from our operations 
compliance with these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of permits 
table of contents for regulated activities  capital expenditures to limit or prevent emissions and discharges  and special precautions for disposal of certain wastes 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties and the issuance of injunctive relief 
spills or releases of chemicals  materials and wastes at our facilities or at offsite locations where they are transported for recycling or disposal could subject us to environmental liability  which may be strict  joint and several  for the costs of cleaning up chemicals  materials and wastes released into the environment and for damages to natural resources  and it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by such spills or releases 
as a result of such actions  we could be required to remove previously disposed wastes  remediate environmental contamination  and undertake measures to prevent future contamination 
the trend in environmental regulation has been to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment and thus any changes in environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position 
for instance  the adoption of laws or implementing regulations with regard to climate change that have the effect of lowering the demand for carbon based fuels or with regard to hydraulic fracturing that have the effect of decreasing the performance of exploratory activities by energy companies could have a material adverse effect on our business 
while we believe that we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on us  we cannot give any assurance that this trend of compliance and avoidance of material costs or other liabilities will continue in the future

you should refer to the explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward looking statements included under cautionary statements about forward looking statements of this form k 
all forward looking statements made by us are qualified by the risk factors described below 
if economic conditions weaken or commodity prices become depressed or decline  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
historically  the demand for our products and services has been sensitive to the level of exploration spending by oil and gas companies 
during the period of depressed commodity prices  such as that experienced in late and  many oil and gas exploration and production companies significantly reduced their levels of capital spending  including amounts dedicated to the leasing or purchasing our seismic equipment 
a return of depressed 
table of contents commodity prices  or a decline in existing commodity prices  could adversely affect demand for the services and equipment we provide  and therefore adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
further  perceptions of a long term decrease in commodity prices by oil and gas companies could similarly reduce or defer major expenditures given the long term nature of many large scale development projects 
lower levels of activity result in a corresponding decline in the demand for our products and services  which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and profitability 
additionally  these factors may adversely impact our statement of financial position if they are determined to cause impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets or of our other long lived assets 
demand for seismic data is not assured 
demand for our services depends on the level of spending by oil and gas companies for exploration  production and development activities  as well as on the number of crews conducting land  transition zone and marine seismic data acquisition worldwide 
the levels of such spending are influenced by oil and gas prices and industry expectations of future price levels  the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and gas  the availability of current geophysical data  the ability of oil and gas companies to generate funds or otherwise obtain capital for exploration operations  the granting of leases or exploration concessions and the expiration of such rights  changes to existing laws and regulations  domestic and foreign tax policies  merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers  the discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves  and local and international political and economic conditions 
the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry can have a significant effect on our revenues and profitability 
historically  oil and natural gas prices  as well as the level of exploration and developmental activity  have fluctuated significantly 
these fluctuations have in the past  and may in the future  adversely affect our business 
we are unable to predict future oil and natural gas prices or the level of oil and gas industry activity 
a prolonged low level of activity in the oil and gas industry will likely depress development activity  adversely affecting the demand for our products and services and our financial condition and results of operations 
our revenues are subject to fluctuations that are beyond our control  which could materially adversely affect our results of operations in a given financial period 
projects awarded to and scheduled by our customers can be delayed or cancelled due to factors that are outside of their control  which can affect the demand for our products and services 
these factors include budgetary or other financial issues of the oil and gas exploration companies  adverse weather conditions  difficulties in obtaining permits or other regulatory issues  the availability of other equipment required for a particular project  political unrest or security concerns in certain foreign locations  as well as a variety of other factors 
a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenues  and the loss of one of these customers could harm our results of operations 
we typically lease and sell significant amounts of seismic equipment to a relatively small number of customers  the composition of which changes from year to year as leases are initiated and concluded and as customers equipment needs vary 
therefore  at any one time  a large portion of our revenues may be derived from a limited number of customers 
in the fiscal years ended january   and  our single largest customer accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenues 
our six largest customers accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues in the fiscal year ended january  
table of contents there has recently been considerable consolidation among certain of our customers and this trend may continue 
this consolidation could result in the loss of one or more of our customers and could result in a decrease in the demand for our equipment 
the financial soundness of our customers could materially affect our business and operating results 
as a result of the disruptions in the financial markets and other macro economic challenges that continue to affect the economy of the united states and other parts of the world  our customers may experience cash flow concerns 
as a result  if customers operating and financial performance deteriorates  or if they are unable to make scheduled payments or obtain credit  customers may not be able to pay  or may delay payment of  accounts receivable owed to us 
any inability of customers to pay us for services could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
as of january   we had approximately million of customer accounts and contracts receivable  of which approximately million was over days past due 
for the years ended january   and  we had charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively  to our provision for doubtful accounts 
significant payment defaults by our customers in excess of the allowance would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
we derive significant revenues from foreign sales  which pose additional risks to our operations 
many of our foreign operations are conducted in currencies other than us dollars 
those currencies include the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  the singapore dollar  the russian ruble and the british pound sterling 
these internationally sourced revenues are subject to the risk of taxation policies  expropriation  political turmoil  civil disturbances  armed hostilities  and other geopolitical hazards as well as foreign currency exchange controls in which payment could not be made in us dollars and fluctuations 
for example  for accounting purposes  balance sheet accounts of our operating subsidiaries are translated at the current exchange rate as of the end of the accounting period 
statement of operations items are translated at average currency exchange rates 
the resulting translation adjustment is recorded as a separate component of comprehensive income within shareholders equity 
this translation adjustment has in the past been  and may in the future be  material because of the significant amount of assets held by our international subsidiaries and the fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates 
capital requirements for our operations are large 
if we are unable to finance these requirements  we may not be able to maintain our competitive advantage 
our sources of working capital are limited 
we have historically funded our working capital requirements with cash generated from operations  cash reserves and short term borrowings from commercial banks 
our working capital requirements continue to increase  primarily due to the expansion of our infrastructure in response to client demand for more recording channels  which has increased as the industry strives for improved data quality with greater subsurface resolution images 
if we were to expand our operations at a rate exceeding operating cash flow  or current demand or pricing of our services were to decrease substantially or if technical advances or competitive pressures required us to acquire new equipment faster than our cash flow could sustain  additional financing could be required 
global financial markets and economic conditions have been uncertain and volatile over recent periods 
the debt and equity capital markets  while somewhat improved recently  were distressed for an extended period of time 
these issues  along with significant losses in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk and the current uncertain economic conditions could make it difficult to obtain funding in the capital markets 
in particular  the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets generally has diminished significantly 
also  as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets generally and the solvency of counterparties specifically  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  enacted tighter lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt at maturity at all or on terms similar to our current debt and reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide any new funding 
due to these factors  we cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed and to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
if funding is not available when needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be 
table of contents unable to grow our existing business  complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected if we are unable to continually obtain additional lease contracts 
our seismic equipment leases typically have a term of two to six months and provide gross revenues that recover only a portion of our capital investment on the initial lease 
our ability to generate lease revenues and profits is dependent on obtaining additional lease contracts after the termination of an original lease 
however  lease customers are under no obligation to  and frequently do not  continue to lease seismic equipment after the expiration of a lease 
although we have been successful in obtaining additional lease contracts with other customers after the termination of the original leases  we cannot assure you that we will continue to do so 
our failure to obtain additional leases or extensions beyond the initial lease term would have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
our failure to attract and retain key personnel could adversely affect our operations 
our success is dependent on  among other things  the services of certain key personnel  including specifically billy f 
mitcham  jr  our president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of mr 
mitcham or other personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the high fixed costs of our operations could adversely affect our results of operations 
our business has high fixed costs  which primarily consist of depreciation expenses associated with our lease pool of seismic data acquisition equipment 
in periods of significant downtime these fixed costs do not decline as rapidly as our revenues 
as a result  any significant downtime or low productivity caused by reduced demand could adversely affect our results of operations 
our long lived assets may be subject to impairment due to the current financial crisis 
we periodically review our long lived assets  including goodwill  other intangible assets and our lease pool of equipment  for impairment 
if we expect significant sustained decreases in oil and natural gas prices in the future  we may be required to write down the value of these assets if the future cash flows anticipated to be generated from the related the assets falls below net book value 
declines in oil and natural gas prices  if sustained  could result in future impairments 
if we are forced to write down the value of our long lived assets  these noncash asset impairments could negatively affect our results of operations in the period in which they are recorded 
see the discussion included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies long lived assets 
our seismic lease pool is subject to technological obsolescence 
we have a substantial capital investment in seismic data acquisition equipment 
the development by manufacturers of seismic equipment of newer technology systems or component parts that have significant competitive advantages over seismic systems and component parts now in use could have an adverse effect on our ability to profitably lease and sell our existing seismic equipment 
significant improvements in technology may also require us to recognize an asset impairment charge to our lease pool investment and to correspondingly invest significant sums to upgrade or replace our existing lease pool with newer technology equipment demanded by our customers  which could affect our ability to compete as well as have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
seasonal conditions cause fluctuations in our operating results 
the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year have historically accounted for a greater portion of our lease revenues than do our second and third quarters 
this seasonality in leasing revenues is primarily due to the increased seismic survey activity in canada and russia from january through march or april 
this seasonal pattern may cause 
table of contents our results of operations to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
accordingly  period to period comparisons are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied on as indicative of future results 
we face competition in our seismic equipment leasing activities 
we have several competitors engaged in seismic equipment leasing and sales  including seismic equipment manufacturers and data acquisition contractors that use seismic equipment  many of which have substantially greater financial resources than our own 
there are also several smaller competitors that  in the aggregate  generate significant revenues from the sale of seismic survey equipment 
pressures from existing or new competitors could adversely affect our business operations 
we rely on a small number of suppliers and disruption in vendor supplies could adversely affect our results of operations 
we purchase the majority of our seismic equipment for our lease pool from a small number of suppliers 
should our relationships with our suppliers deteriorate  we may have difficulty in obtaining new technology required by our customers and maintaining our existing equipment in accordance with manufacturers specifications 
in addition  we may  from time to time  experience supply or quality control problems with suppliers  and these problems could significantly affect our ability to meet our lease commitments 
reliance on certain suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involve several risks  including the possibility of a shortage or a lack of availability of key products and increases in product costs and reduced control over delivery schedules  any of these events could adversely affect our future results of operations 
equipment in our lease pool may be subject to the intellectual property claims of others that could adversely affect our ability to generate revenue from the lease of the equipment 
certain of the equipment in our lease pool is proprietary to us 
the equipment we acquired with the acquisition of aes  see item business  includes heli pickers and associated equipment that is manufactured by aes and is subject to various patents  see item business intellectual property 
we also have some equipment in our lease pool that is manufactured by our seamap segment  which is subject to intellectual property rights and protection as discussed below 
we may be subject to infringement claims and other intellectual property disputes as competition in the marketplace continues to intensify 
in the future  we may be subject to litigation and may be required to defend against claimed infringements of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be costly and divert management s attention from operations 
in addition  adverse determinations in such litigation could  among other things result in the loss of our proprietary rights to use the technology  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  and prevent us from leasing or selling our products that incorporate the technology 
additionally  the equipment that we acquire from other suppliers may be subject to the intellectual property infringement claims from third parties 
we generally are indemnified by our suppliers against any claims that may be brought against us by third parties related to equipment they sold to us 
however  such claims could affect our ability to acquire additional such products or to lease them in the future 
the loss of this future revenue could adversely affect our business and would not generally be covered by the indemnities from our suppliers 
in february  ion obtained a judgment against sercel as a result of a patent infringement suit 
one aspect of the judgment restricts the importation and use of certain seismic equipment in the united states  including sercel s xl dsu products 
we currently own a significant amount of this equipment and have agreed to purchase additional amounts pursuant to our exclusive equipment lease agreement with sercel 
we believe that essentially all of this equipment that we currently own is not subject to any restrictions as to use in the united states 
however  if we are unable to import into or use in the united states any of equipment that we buy in the future  our 
table of contents financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we understand that sercel has appealed this judgment  but the potential results or timing of any ruling on this appeal are unknown 
the operations of seamap are subject to special risks that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
the design and manufacturing operations of our seamap segment are subject to risks not associated with our equipment leasing business 
these risks include the following risks associated with intellectual property 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property 
we also enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners and control access to and distribution of our design information  documentation and other proprietary information 
these intellectual property protection measures may not be sufficient to prevent wrongful misappropriation of our technology 
in addition  these measures will not prevent competitors from independently developing technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology 
the laws of many foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states 
failure to protect proprietary information could result in  among other things  loss of competitive advantage  loss of customer orders and decreased revenues 
monitoring the unauthorized use of our products is difficult and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be impaired 
we may be subject to infringement claims and other intellectual property disputes as competition in the marketplace continues to intensify 
in the future  we may be subject to litigation and may be required to defend against claimed infringements of the rights of others or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be costly and divert management s attention from operations 
in addition  adverse determinations in such litigation could  among other things result in the loss of our proprietary rights to use the technology  subject us to significant liabilities  require us to seek licenses from third parties  require us to redesign the products that use the technology  and prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products that incorporate the technology 
if we are forced to take any of the foregoing actions  our business may be seriously harmed 
any litigation to protect our intellectual property or to defend ourselves against the claims of others could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and may not ultimately be successful 
risks related to product performance 
the production of new products with high technology content involves occasional problems while the technology and manufacturing methods mature 
if significant reliability or quality problems develop  including those due to faulty components  a number of negative effects on our business could result  including costs associated with reworking the manufacturing processes  high service and warranty expenses  high inventory obsolescence expense  high levels of product returns  delays in collecting accounts receivable  reduced orders from existing customers  and declining interest from potential customers 

table of contents although we maintain accruals for product warranties  actual costs could exceed these amounts 
from time to time  there may be interruptions or delays in the activation of products at a customer s site 
these interruptions or delays may result from product performance problems or from aspects of the installation and activation activities  some of which are outside our control 
if we experience significant interruptions or delays that cannot be promptly resolved  confidence in our products could be undermined  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
risks related to raw materials 
we depend on a limited number of suppliers for components of our products  as well as for equipment used to design and test our products 
certain components used in our products may be available from a sole source or limited number of vendors 
if these suppliers were to limit or reduce the sale of such components to us  or if these suppliers were to experience financial difficulties or other problems that prevented them from supplying us with the necessary components  these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
these sole source and other suppliers are each subject to quality and performance issues  materials shortages  excess demand  reduction in capacity and other factors that may disrupt the flow of goods to us  thereby adversely affecting our business and customer relationships 
some of the sole source and limited source vendors are companies who  from time to time  may allocate parts to equipment manufacturers due to market demand for components and equipment 
we have no guaranteed supply arrangements with our suppliers and there can be no assurance that our suppliers will continue to meet our requirements 
many of our competitors are much larger and may be able to obtain priority allocations from these shared vendors  thereby limiting or making our sources of supply unreliable for these components 
if our supply arrangements are interrupted  we cannot assure you that we would be able to find another supplier on a timely or satisfactory basis 
any delay in component availability for any of our products could result in delays in deployment of these products and in our ability to recognize revenues 
if we are unable to obtain a sufficient supply of components from alternative sources  reduced supplies and higher prices of components will significantly limit our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to customers 
a delay in receiving certain components or the inability to receive certain components could harm our customer relationships and our results of operations 
failures of components affect the reliability and performance of our products  can reduce customer confidence in our products  and may adversely affect our financial performance 
from time to time  we may experience delays in receipt of components and may receive components that do not perform according to their specifications 
any future difficulty in obtaining sufficient and timely delivery of components could result in delays or reductions in product shipments that could harm our business 
in addition  a consolidation among suppliers of these components or adverse developments in their businesses that affect their ability to meet our supply demands could adversely impact the availability of components that we depend on 
delayed deliveries from these sources could adversely affect our business 
we are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations that could increase our costs of compliance and impose significant liabilities 
we are subject to stringent governmental laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment and the handling of chemicals and materials used in our manufacturing processes as well as the recycling and disposal of wastes generated by those processes 
these laws and regulations may impose joint and several strict liability and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  imposition of remedial obligations  and issuance of orders enjoining some or all of our operations 
these laws and regulations could require us to acquire permits to conduct regulated activities  install and maintain costly equipment and pollution control technologies  conduct remediation of contaminated soils and groundwater  remove previously disposed water  or undertake measures to prevent future contamination or incur other significant environmental related expenses 
public interest in the protection of the environment has increased dramatically in recent years 
we anticipate that the trend of more expansive and stricter environmental laws and regulations will continue  the occurrence of which may require us to increase our capital expenditures or could result in increased operating expenses 

table of contents climate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in reduced demand for oil and natural gas  thereby adversely affecting our business  while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our manufacturing of seismic equipment and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 
in december  the epa published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide  methane and other greenhouse gases present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are  according to the epa  contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere and other climatic changes 
based on these findings  the epa has begun adopting and implementing regulations that restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the federal clean air act 
the epa already has adopted two sets of rules regulating ghg emissions under the clean air act  one of which requires a reduction in emissions of ghgs from motor vehicles and the other of which regulates emissions of ghgs from certain large stationary sources under the prevention of significant deterioration psd and title v permitting programs  effective january  this stationary source rule tailors these permitting programs to apply to certain stationary sources in a multi step process  with the largest sources first subject to permitting 
facilities required to obtain psd permits for their ghg emissions also will be required to reduce those emissions according to best available control technology standards for ghg that will be established by the states or  in some instances  by the epa on a case by case basis 
the epa s rules relating to emissions of ghgs from large stationary sources of emissions are currently subject to a number of legal challenges  but the federal courts have thus far declined to issue any injunctions to prevent epa from implementing  or requiring state environmental agencies to implement  the rules 
in addition  on november   the epa published a final rule expanding its existing ghg emissions reporting rule to include onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production and onshore oil and natural gas processing  transmission  storage  and distribution activities  beginning in for emissions occurring in also  the united states congress has from time to time considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of ghgs and almost one half of the states have already taken legal measures to reduce emissions of ghgs  primarily through the planned development of ghg emission inventories and or regional ghg cap and trade programs 
most of these cap and trade programs work by requiring either major sources of emissions or major producers of fuels to acquire and surrender emission allowances  with the number of allowances available for purchase reduced each year until the overall ghg emission reduction goal is achieved 
these allowances would be expected to escalate significantly in cost over time 
the adoption and implementation of any laws and regulations imposing reporting obligations on  or limiting emissions of greenhouse gases from  oil and gas exploration and production activities could have an adverse effect on the demand for our seismic equipment and associated services 
finally  it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the earth s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects  such as increased frequency and severity of storms  floods and other climatic events  if any such effects were to occur  they could adversely affect or delay our manufacturing of seismic equipment and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects 
federal and state legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in additional operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business 
hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons  particularly natural gas  from tight formations such as shales 
the process involves the injection of water  sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production 
the process is typically regulated by state oil and gas commissions 
however  the epa recently asserted federal regulatory authority over hydraulic fracturing involving diesel additives under the safe drinking water act s underground injection control program 
while the epa has yet to take any action to enforce or implement this newly asserted regulatory authority  industry groups have filed suit challenging the epa s recent decision 
at the same time  the epa has commenced a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities  with initial results of the study expected to be available in late in addition  legislation was introduced in the past session of congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process  and such legislation could be introduced and adopted in the current session of congress 
also  some states have adopted  and other states are considering adopting  regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances 
if new federal or state laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted  such legal requirements could make it more 
table of contents difficult to complete natural gas wells in certain formations and adversely affect demand for our seismic equipment and associated services 
the deepwater horizon event and its aftermath  including any additional regulations that cause delays or deter new drilling  could adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
as a result of the deepwater horizon explosion and related oil leak last april in the us gulf of mexico  the secretary of the us department of the interior directed the bureau of ocean energy management  regulation and enforcement boemre to issue a suspension  until november   of drilling activities for specified drilling configurations and technologies 
although this moratorium was lifted on october   we cannot predict with certainty when drilling operations will fully resume in the us gulf of mexico 
the boemre has also issued new guidelines and regulations regarding safety  environmental matters  drilling equipment and decommissioning applicable to drilling in the us gulf of mexico  and may take other additional steps that could increase the costs of exploration and production  reduce the area of operations and result in permitting delays 
notwithstanding the lifting of the moratorium  we anticipate that there will continue to be delays in the resumption of drilling related activities  including delays in the issuance of drilling permits  as these various regulatory initiatives are implemented 
in addition to the new requirements recently imposed by the boemre  there have been a variety of proposals to change existing laws and regulations  including the proposal to significantly increase the ability to demonstrate the minimum financial responsibility under the federal oil pollution act of implementation of any one or more of the various proposed changes could materially adversely affect operations in the us gulf of mexico by raising operating costs  increasing insurance premiums  delaying drilling operations and increasing regulatory requirements  and  further  could lead to a wide variety of other unforeseeable consequences that make operations in the us gulf of mexico and other offshore waters more difficult  more time consuming  and more costly 
any one or more of these factors that lead to an increase in the cost of operations in offshore waters or any decrease or delay in offshore exploration and production activity could have a material adverse effect on the operation of the offshore exploration and development industry  which could adversely affect our financial condition  cash flows and results of operations 
our stock price is subject to volatility 
energy and energy service company stock prices  including our stock price  have been extremely volatile from time to time 
stock price volatility could adversely affect our business operations by  among other things  impeding our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and to obtain additional financing 
we have significant operations outside of the united states that expose us to certain additional risks 
we operate in a number of foreign locations and have subsidiaries or branches in foreign countries  including russia  peru and colombia 
our equipment is also often temporarily located in other foreign locations while under rent by our customers 
these operations expose us to political and economic risks and uncertainties 
should current circumstances change  we could encounter difficulties in operating in some countries and may not be able to retrieve our equipment that is located within these counties 
this could result in a material adverse effect on our financial positions and results of operations 
because we have no plans to pay any dividends for the foreseeable future  investors must look solely to stock appreciation for a return on their investment in us 
we have not paid cash dividends on our common stock since our incorporation and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
we currently intend to retain any future earnings to support our operations and growth 
any payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent on the amount of funds legally available  our financial condition  capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
accordingly  investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation  which may never occur  as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment 

table of contents provisions in our articles of incorporation and texas law could discourage a takeover attempt  which may reduce or eliminate the likelihood of a change of control transaction and  therefore  the ability of our shareholders to sell their shares for a premium 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and the texas business organizations code may tend to delay  defer or prevent a potential unsolicited offer or takeover attempt that is not approved by our board of directors but that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interest  including an attempt that might result in shareholders receiving a premium over the market price for their shares 
because our board of directors is authorized to issue preferred stock with preferences and rights as it determines  it may afford the holders of any series of preferred stock preferences  rights or voting powers superior to those of the holders of common stock 
although we have no shares of preferred stock outstanding and no present intention to issue any shares of our preferred stock  there can be no assurance that we will not do so in the future

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we operate in two segments  equipment leasing and seamap 
our equipment leasing operations are conducted from our huntsville  texas headquarters and from our locations in calgary  canada  brisbane  australia  lima  peru  bogota  colombia  and ufa  russia 
this includes the operations of our mcl  sap and mse subsidiaries and our branches in peru and colombia 
these branches were established late in fiscal and did not contribute material revenues prior to the year ended january  seamap operates from its locations near bristol  united kingdom and in singapore 
management believes that the performance of our equipment leasing segment is indicated by revenues from equipment leasing and by the level of our investment in lease pool equipment 
management further believes that the performance of our seamap segment is indicated by revenues from equipment sales and by gross profit from those sales 
management monitors ebitda and adjusted ebitda  both as defined in the following table  as key indicators of our overall performance and liquidity 

table of contents the following table presents certain operating information by operating segment years ended january  in thousands revenues equipment leasing seamap less inter segment sales total revenues cost of sales equipment leasing seamap less inter segment costs total direct costs gross profit equipment leasing seamap less inter segment amounts total gross profit operating expenses general and administrative provision for doubtful accounts gain on insurance settlement depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income ebitda adjusted ebitda reconciliation of net income to ebitda and adjusted ebitda net income interest expense income  net depreciation  amortization and impairment provision for income taxes gain from bargain purchase ebitda stock based compensation adjusted ebitda

adjusted ebitda excludes stock based compensation 
we consider ebitda and adjusted ebitda to be important indicators for the performance of our business  but not measures of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
we have included these non gaap financial measures because management utilizes this information for assessing our performance and liquidity  and as indicators of our ability to make capital expenditures  service debt and finance working capital requirements 
the covenants of our revolving credit agreement require us to maintain a minimum level of ebitda 
management believes that ebitda and adjusted ebitda are measurements that are commonly used by analysts and some investors in evaluating the performance and liquidity of companies such as us 
in particular  we believe that it is useful to our analysts and investors to understand this relationship because it excludes transactions not related to our core cash operating activities 
we believe that excluding these transactions allows investors to meaningfully trend and analyze the performance of our core cash operations 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under gaap and should not be considered in isolation or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities or as alternatives to net income as indicators of operating performance or any other measures of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
in evaluating our performance as measured by ebitda  management recognizes and considers the limitations of this measurement 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda do not reflect our obligations for the payment of income taxes  interest expense or other obligations such as capital expenditures 
accordingly  editda and adjusted ebitda are only two of the measurements that management utilizes 
other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda or adjusted ebitda differently than we do and ebitda and adjusted ebitda may not be comparable with similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
in our equipment leasing segment  we lease seismic data acquisition equipment primarily to seismic data acquisition companies conducting land  transition zone and marine seismic surveys worldwide 
we provide short term leasing of seismic equipment to meet a customer s requirements 
all active leases at january  were for a term of less than one year 
seismic equipment held for lease is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation 
we acquire some marine lease pool equipment from our seamap segment 
these amounts are carried in our lease pool at the cost to our seamap segment  less accumulated depreciation 
from time to time  we sell lease pool equipment to our customers 
these sales are usually transacted when we have equipment for which we do not have near term needs in our leasing business 
we also occasionally sell new seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers 
aes produces and sells  as well as leases  equipment used to deploy and retrieve seismic equipment with helicopters 
in addition to leasing seismic equipment  sap sells equipment  consumables  systems integration  
table of contents engineering hardware and software maintenance support services to the seismic  hydrographic  oceanographic  environmental and defense industries throughout southeast asia and australia 
our seamap segment designs  manufactures and sells a variety of products used primarily in marine seismic applications 
seamap s primary products include the i gunlink seismic source acquisition and control systems  which provide marine operators more precise control of exploration tools  and ii the buoylink rgps tracking system used to provide precise positioning of seismic sources and streamers marine recording channels that are towed behind a vessel 
seismic equipment leasing is susceptible to weather patterns in certain geographic regions 
in canada and russia  a significant percentage of the seismic survey activity normally occurs in the winter months  from december through march or april 
during the months in which the weather is warmer  certain areas are not accessible to trucks  earth vibrators and other heavy equipment because of the unstable terrain 
in other areas of the world  such as southeast asia and the pacific rim  periods of heavy rain  known as monsoons  can impair seismic operations 
we are able  in many cases  to transfer our equipment from one region to another in order to deal with seasonal demand and to increase our equipment utilization 
business outlook our revenues are directly related to the level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities and the profitability and cash flows of oil and gas companies and seismic contractors  which  in turn  are affected by expectations regarding the supply and demand for oil and natural gas  energy prices and finding and development costs 
land seismic data acquisition activity levels are measured in terms of the number of active recording crews  known as the crew count  and the number of recording channels deployed by those crews  known as channel count 
because an accurate and reliable census of active crews does not exist  it is not possible to make definitive statements regarding the absolute levels of seismic data acquisition activity 
furthermore  a significant number of seismic data acquisition contractors are either private or state owned enterprises and information about their activities is not available in the public domain 
in recent months  there has been a recovery in global crude oil prices and  to a much lesser extent  north american natural gas prices 
as a result of this  we have seen an increase in activity in areas such as russia  southeast asia and south america 
however  activity in north america has not recovered to the same degree 
there are continued indications of improving business conditions in the seismic services industry  including recently some related to north america 
the majority of activity in the united states is taking place within various so called shale plays 
these indications include increased bid activity in our business and higher activity reported by certain seismic contractors 
however  the magnitude and breadth of this recovery is uncertain 
uncertainty about the breadth and sustainability of the global economic recovery  we believe  contributes to this unsettled situation in the energy industry 
prior to the turmoil in global financial markets  which arose during  the oil and gas exploration industry enjoyed generally sustained growth for a period of more than four years  fueled primarily by historically high commodity prices for oil and natural gas 
we  along with much of the seismic industry  benefited from this growth 
these higher prices resulted in increased activity within the oil and gas industry and  in turn  resulted in an increased demand for seismic services 
beginning in approximately october  there was a dramatic decline in oil and gas prices that resulted in a significant reduction in oil and gas exploration activity 
accordingly  beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to see a decline in demand for our products and services 
this decline was the most dramatic in north america  russia and the cis 
in north america  we believe the decline resulted from the decrease in oil and natural gas prices and from difficulties in the credit markets  which limited the amount of capital available to independent oil and gas exploration companies 
in russia and the cis  we think the decline in global oil prices and the devaluation of the ruble had a dramatic negative effect on the economics of oil and gas exploration and production operations 
furthermore  the global financial crisis had a material adverse effect on the liquidity available to these companies in russia and the cis 
during this period  there were some areas where oil and gas exploration activities continued 
we believe that this continued activity was largely driven by the super major oil and gas companies and by national oil companies 

table of contents in april  there was a fire and explosion aboard the deepwater horizon drilling platform operated by bp in ultra deep water in the gulf of mexico 
as a result of the explosion  ensuing fire and apparent failure of the blowout preventers  the rig sank and created a catastrophic oil spill that produced widespread economic  environmental and natural resource damage in the gulf coast region 
in response to the explosion and spill  there have been many proposals by governmental and private constituencies to address the direct impact of the disaster and to prevent similar disasters in the future 
the boemre implemented a moratorium on deepwater drilling activities in the us gulf of mexico that was lifted by secretary of the interior ken salazar on october  the moratorium effectively halted deepwater drilling of wells using subsea blowout preventers bops or surface bops on a floating facility 
in addition  while the moratorium was in place  the boemre issued a series of ntls and adopted changes to its regulations to impose a variety of new safety and operating measures intended to help prevent a similar disaster in the future 
for example  before being allowed to resume drilling in deepwater  outer continental shelf operators must certify compliance with all applicable operating regulations found in cfr part  including those rules recently placed into effect  such as rules relating to well casing and cementing  bops  safety certification  emergency response  and worker training 
operators also must demonstrate the availability of adequate spill response and blowout containment resources 
this oil spill and the regulatory actions taken by boemre in response to the incident have had an adverse effect on seismic exploration programs in the affected areas 
notwithstanding the lifting of the moratorium  we anticipate that there will continue to be delays in the resumption of drilling related activities in deepwater  including delays in the issuance of drilling permits  as these various regulatory initiatives are fully implemented 
these new requirements also have slowed the issuance of permits for new wells in shallow waters that were not subject to the moratorium 
in addition to the new requirements recently imposed by the boemre  there have been a variety of proposals to change existing laws and regulations that could adversely affect drilling operations and cause operators to incur increased costs 
implementation of any one or more of the various proposed changes could materially adversely affect operations in the gulf of mexico by raising operating costs  increasing insurance premiums  delaying drilling operations and increasing regulatory burdens  and  further  could lead to a wide variety of other unforeseeable consequences that make operations in the gulf of mexico and other offshore waters more difficult  more time consuming  and more costly 
for example  congress considered a variety of amendments to the oil pollution act of  or opa  legislation in its last session in response to the deepwater horizon incident that  including increasing the level of financial responsibility required of offshore operators to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill as well as increasing or totally eliminating limits for damages arising from an oil spill from a covered offshore facility that might be imposed on such operators  and it is unknown if similar legislation will be introduced and adopted in the current session of congress 
the adoption of any such amendments to opa could significantly increase the costs of drilling and operating wells in offshore waters and thereby reduce the level of exploration and productions activities on the outer continental shelf 
any increase in the cost of operations in offshore waters and any decrease in offshore exploration and production activity could have a material adverse effect on the operation of the offshore exploration and development industry  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operation 
while we have provided equipment for some marine seismic surveys in the gulf of mexico and these surveys have been delayed or cancelled  we do not expect the impact of these actions to be adversely material to us 
due to the factors discussed above  the current outlook for our business remains uncertain 
however  the geographic breadth of our operations and our expansive lease pool of equipment  as well as our generally stable financial position and our million credit line position us  we believe  to address any downturn in the seismic industry for the foreseeable future 
the market for products sold by seamap and the demand for the leasing of marine seismic equipment is dependent upon activity within the offshore  or marine  seismic industry  including the re fitting of existing seismic vessels and the equipping of new vessels 
seamap has enjoyed increases in revenues over the past three fiscal years  despite of a general downturn in the marine seismic market during this period 
our seamap business has benefited from equipping new build vessels and from re equipping older vessels with newer  more efficient technology 
in addition  as seamap has expanded its installed base of products  our business for replacements  spare parts  repair and support services has expanded 
certain existing and potential customers continue to express interest in our 
table of contents gunlink and buoylink products 
some of this interest involves the upgrade of exiting gunlink and buoylink products to newer versions or systems with greater functionality 
over the past several years we have made significant additions to our lease pool of equipment  amounting to approximately million in equipment purchases during the five years ended january  by adding this equipment we have not only expanded the amount of equipment that we have  but have also increased the geographic expanse of our leasing operations and have expanded the types of equipment that we have in our lease pool 
additions to our lease pool during fiscal amounted to approximately million 
during fiscal  we added approximately million of new lease pool equipment  despite the decline in demand for equipment during this period 
although we did experience an overall decline in demand in fiscal  there was an increase in demand for certain types of equipment  such as downhole seismic tools and three component digital sensors 
in fiscal we added approximately million of equipment to our lease pool 
as demand warrants  and as our access to capital allows  we will continue to make additions to our lease pool 
subsequent to january   we have added  or committed to add  approximately million of additional equipment  primarily for markets such as south america and europe 
we have expanded our lease pool by acquiring different types of equipment or equipment that can be used in different types of seismic applications 
for example  we added marine seismic equipment to our lease pool and have purchased downhole seismic equipment that can be utilized in a wide array of applications  some of which are not related to oil and gas exploration 
these applications include d surface seismic surveys  well and reservoir monitoring  analysis of fluid treatments of oil and gas wells and underground storage monitoring 
we also have recently added cable free recording technology to our lease pool of ground recording equipment 
in the future we may seek to further expand the breadth of our lease pool  which could increase the amount we expend on the acquisition of lease pool equipment 
we also have expanded the geographic breadth of our operations by acquiring or establishing operating facilities in new locations 
most recently  in fiscal  we established branch operations in peru and in colombia 
we may seek to expand our operations in to additional locations in the future either through establishing green field operations or by acquiring existing operations 
however  we do not currently have any specific plans to establish any such operations 
a significant portion of our revenues are generated from foreign sources 
for the years ended january   and  revenues from international customers totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these amounts represent  and of consolidated revenues in those fiscal years  respectively 
the decrease in the proportion of our revenues from foreign sources in fiscal was the result of a specific contract in the united states during that period and was not  we believe  indicative of a trend 
the majority of our transactions with foreign customers are denominated in united states  australian  canadian and singapore dollars  russian rubles and british pounds sterling 
we have not entered  nor do we intend to enter  into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
our revenues and results of operations have not been materially impacted by inflation or changing prices in the past three fiscal years  except as described above 
results of operations for the fiscal year ended january   we recorded operating income of approximately million  compared to approximately  for the fiscal year ended january  and approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  the increase in fiscal reflects increased leasing revenue associated with the recovery in demand for seismic equipment 
the significant decline in fiscal was primarily the result of reduced equipment leasing revenues  reduced equipment sales within our leasing segment and higher lease pool depreciation charges 
these declines in fiscal were offset by improved sales and gross profits from our seamap segment and by lower general and administrative expense 
the gross profit for our equipment leasing segment increased to approximately million in fiscal  compared to approximately million in fiscal this increase resulted from higher leasing revenues  increased sales of new seismic  hydrographic and oceanographic equipment and is despite increased depreciation expense related to our lease pool of equipment 
our equipment leasing segment recorded decreased gross profit in the year ended january   as compared to the million for the year ended january  decreased 
table of contents leasing and equipment sales revenues  combined with higher direct costs and lease pool depreciation contributed to this decline 
our seamap segment recorded gross profits of million  million and million in the years ended january   and  respectively 
seamap revenues increased in each of these years despite the overall downturn in the seismic industry that incurred during fiscal because certain customers continued to buy new equipment in order to enhance efficiency by upgrading technology 
the improvement in revenues is also due in part to on going support activities from our installed base of these products 
gross margins between fiscal and remained unchanged as approximately 
we improved gross profit margins for fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily through improved production efficiencies 
revenues and cost of sales equipment leasing revenues and cost of sales from our equipment leasing segment were comprised of the following years ended january  in thousands revenues equipment leasing lease pool equipment sales new seismic equipment sales sap equipment sales cost of sales lease pool depreciation direct costs equipment leasing cost of lease pool equipment sales cost of new seismic equipment sales cost of sap equipment sales gross profit gross profit margin during fiscal we began to experience a recovery in demand for seismic equipment from the decline that began in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting in a increase in leasing revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal geographically we experienced increased demand in south america  north america  russia  europe and the middle east  and this demand appears to be continuing into fiscal we were able to respond to this increase in demand partially because of the additions we had made to our lease pool of equipment over the past few years 
also contributing to the increase in leasing revenues was our acquisition of aes in march of  resulting in approximately million in additional leasing revenues 
leasing revenues for fiscal declined approximately from fiscal the demand for equipment in canada and russia that normally occurs with the onset of winter was lower than in prior years and was significantly less than had been anticipated earlier in the year 
this decline was due to significant reductions in oil and gas exploration activity as discussed above 
the reduced activity in north america and the cis  as well as other parts of the world  continued throughout fiscal during fiscal  there were areas of improving demand such as south america and the pacific rim and late in demand began to increase in russia and for marine equipment 
these improvements did not  however  offset the overall decline in demand 
during fiscal  we generated approximately million in equipment leasing revenues from one project in the united states 
this was an unusually large contract and there can be no assurance that we will obtain similar contracts in the future 

table of contents from time to time  we sell equipment from our lease pool based on specific customer demand or in order to redeploy our capital in other lease pool assets 
these transactions tend to occur as opportunities arise and accordingly are difficult to predict 
the gross profit and related gross profit margin from the sales of lease pool equipment amounted to approximately million in fiscal   in fiscal  and million in fiscal often  the equipment that is sold from our lease pool has been held by us  and therefore depreciated  for some period of time 
accordingly  the equipment sold may have a relatively low net book value at the time of the sale  resulting in a relatively high gross profit from the transaction 
the amount of the gross profit on a particular transaction varies greatly based primarily upon the age of the equipment 
occasionally  we sell new seismic equipment that we acquire from other manufacturers  and aes regularly sells equipment that it produces for use in deploying and retrieving seismic equipment by helicopter 
often  the sales of new seismic equipment are structured with a significant down payment  with the balance financed over a period of time at a market rate of interest 
the gross profit and related gross profit margin from the sales of new seismic equipment amounted to approximately million in fiscal   in fiscal and million in fiscal the down turn in oil and gas exploration activity in late resulted in a significant decline in demand for the purchase of new and used land seismic equipment during fiscal during fiscal  aes contributed approximately million to new and used equipment sales 
sap regularly sells new hydrographic and oceanographic equipment to customers in australia and throughout the pacific rim 
the gross profit and related gross profit margin from the sale of new seismic  hydrographic and oceanographic equipment by sap amounted to approximately  in fiscal    in fiscal  and million in fiscal included in sap equipment sales for the year ended january  and is approximately  and million  respectively  related to an approximately million contract with the australian government 
this contract was accounted for using the percentage of completion method and resulted in a gross loss of approximately  in fiscal during fiscal  we incurred approximately  in unexpected costs related to the fulfillment of this contract which amounts were not reimbursed 
this contract was completed and all amounts owing related to it were collected in fiscal the sale of hydrographic and oceanographic equipment in fiscal declined  we believe  due to the budgetary concerns of various governmental agencies in light of the global financial crisis 
these concerns caused projects and purchases to be cancelled or postponed 
in fiscal we saw a partial recovery  however  this business remains subject to uncertainty due to governmental budgetary issues in many parts of the pacific rim 
depreciation expense related to lease pool equipment for fiscal amounted to approximately million  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal the increase in depreciation expense in each of the periods resulted from the significant additions to our lease pool of equipment that we have made in recent periods 
at january   lease pool assets with an acquisition cost of approximately million were fully depreciated  yet remained in service 
this compares to million at january  and approximately million at january  these assets  though fully depreciated  are expected to continue to generate revenues through leasing activity 
our business generally parallels trends in the oil and gas industry 
increased demand for our equipment results in higher revenues and generally has no impact on depreciation in the short term as our equipment is depreciated from the first month it is placed in service until it is fully depreciated 
depreciation expense is recorded monthly whether or not the equipment is actually generating revenues on a lease contract 
during periods of high demand  our ability to lease older equipment  including fully depreciated equipment is enhanced  whereas in periods of low  the opposite is true 
as a result  revenues and depreciation expense will not necessarily directly correlate 
over the long term  depreciation expense is impacted by increases in equipment purchases to meet demand for our leased equipment 
we have been able to purchase equipment at discounts through volume purchase arrangements 
a lower purchase price results in lower depreciation expense than in previous periods 
although some of the equipment in our lease pool has reached the end of its depreciable life the equipment continues to be in service and continues to generate revenues 
because the depreciable life of our equipment in our industry is determined more by technical obsolescence than by usage or wear and tear  some of our equipment  although fully depreciated  is still capable of functioning appropriately 

table of contents we recorded direct costs related to seismic leasing for fiscal in the amount of approximately million as compared to approximately million in fiscal and approximately million in fiscal direct costs typically fluctuate with leasing revenues  as the three main components of direct costs are freight  repairs and sublease expense 
in fiscal  costs increased despite the decline in leasing revenues due to the cost of importing equipment into russia  peru and colombia and due to costs associated with sub leasing certain equipment 
fiscal direct costs were higher in relation to leasing revenues than in fiscal due to on going sublease and transportation costs 
seamap revenues and cost of sales for our seamap segment were as follows years ended january  in thousands equipment sales cost of equipment sales gross profit gross profit margin demand for seamap s products is generally dependent upon offshore oil and gas exploration activity 
a large portion of seamap s sales consist of large discrete orders the timing of which is dictated by our customers 
this timing generally relates to the availability of a vessel in port so that our equipment can be installed 
accordingly  there can be significant variation in sales from one period to another that does not necessarily indicate a fundamental change in demand for these products 
despite the overall decline in oil and gas exploration activity discussed above  we did not experience a decline in the demand for seamap s products in fiscal or fiscal we believe that we have continued to experience relatively strong demand during this period because operators of marine seismic vessels have been adding newly built vessels to replace older  less efficient vessels and have been upgrading technology on remaining vessels in order to improve operating efficiency 
during fiscal we delivered four gunlink units and seven buoylink units  as compared to four and nine units  respectively in fiscal and one and eight units  respectively in fiscal as we have increased our installed base of gunlink and buoylink  as well as other products  we have generated increased revenues from the sale of spare parts  repairs and support services 
as of january   seamap had a backlog of approximately million  as compared to approximately million as of january  and million as of january  the gross profit margin from the sale of seamap equipment was essentially unchanged between fiscal and fiscal  as production levels were approximately the same in each period and our production operations in singapore remained stable 
in both of the last two fiscal years we have been able to plan production and purchasing activities efficiently due to good visibility of the delivery requirements of our customers 
this has contributed to higher gross margins than that experienced in fiscal operating expenses general and administrative expenses for fiscal amounted to approximately million  compared to approximately million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal resulted primarily from higher compensation costs  including incentive compensation  and higher travel costs 
in fiscal  general and administrative expenses declined as compared to fiscal due to lower stock based compensation  incentive compensation  travel and legal expenses 
in fiscal  we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately million  as compared to approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal under accounting standards codification asc  the fair value of stock based awards  such as stock options and restricted stock  is estimated at the time of the grant 
this estimated value is then amortized over the expected vesting period of the award as compensation expense 
during fiscal  and  we recorded a provision for doubtful accounts in the amount of approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
the provision for doubtful accounts in fiscal and fiscal includes approximately million related to one customer located in the cis 
also 
table of contents included in the provision for doubtful accounts are approximately  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal related to a contract receivable 
the customer defaulted on this obligation and we foreclosed on the equipment and other assets that were pledged as collateral  however  we were not able to recover some of the equipment 
we have reduced the carrying value of this contract receivable to an amount equal to the fair market value of the equipment we did recover  based on an independent appraisal  less the costs to retrieve the equipment 
the recovered equipment  which had an appraised value of approximately million  was added to our lease pool in fiscal we have filed a claim with our insurance carrier relating to this matter and have a claim against the bankruptcy estate of the customer 
however  the amount the recovery  if any  from these claims is uncertain and therefore have not been considered in determining the amount recoverable 
at january  and  we had trade accounts and note receivables over days past due of approximately million and million  respectively 
in our industry  and in our experience  it is not unusual for accounts to become delinquent from time to time and this is not necessarily indicative of an account becoming uncollectable 
as of january  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
depreciation and amortization  other than lease pool depreciation  relates primarily to the depreciation of furniture  fixtures and office equipment and the amortization of intangible assets arising from the acquisition of seamap 
other income and expense we completed the acquisition of aes on march  the fair value of the assets and liabilities we acquired  as determined by a third party appraisal  exceeded the total consideration we paid by approximately million 
accordingly  pursuant to the provisions of asc we recorded a gain from the bargain purchase as of the acquisition date 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
interest income reflects amounts earned on invested funds and finance charges related to seismic equipment sold under financing arrangements 
interest expense primarily reflects interest costs arising from borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
interest expense increased in fiscal and fiscal due to borrowings under our line of credit used to finance purchases of lease pool 
other income for the year ended january   and includes expense of approximately  income of approximately  and income of approximately  respectively  related to net foreign exchange losses and gains 
these gains resulted primarily from transactions of our foreign subsidiaries denominated in us dollars 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes in fiscal amounted to approximately million 
this amount included a current tax provision of approximately million  a deferred tax benefit of approximately  a provision of approximately  related to the potential impact of uncertain tax benefits  and estimated penalties and interest of approximately  related to the potential impact of uncertain tax positions 
the current tax provision is made up of a benefit of approximately  in united states taxes and approximately million payable to foreign jurisdictions  primarily the united kingdom  canada  australia  singapore and russia 
in accordance with the provisions asc  we have estimated the amount of penalties and interest that might accrue during the period should certain uncertain tax positions be resolved not in our favor 
this amount is recorded as income tax expense 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our canadian tax returns have been audited by the canadian revenue agency cra 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in connection with these audits  the cra and provincial taxing authorities have assessed additional taxes  penalties and interest of approximately million 
the matters giving rise to these assessments relate  we believe  primarily to issues as to whether deductions are properly taken in canada  or should be taken in the united states 
therefore  we have made application to the cra and to the internal revenue service irs for competent authority assistance in order to avoid potential double taxation as provided for under the tax treaty between the united states and canada 
accordingly  we expect these issues to be resolved pursuant to the competent authority process between the cra and irs 
we have  however  filed protective protests 
table of contents with the cra and with the province of alberta in case our request for competent authority assistance is denied 
the issues involved in these assessments are included in our analysis of uncertain tax positions 
in connection with the protests  we were required to make a payment totaling approximately million against these potential obligations 
should we prevail in our request for assistance or in our appeals  all  or a portion  of this payment will be refunded 
we are unable to estimate how long it will take to resolve these matters 
our provision for income taxes in fiscal amounted to approximately  this amount included a current tax benefit of  a deferred tax benefit of  a provision of  related to the potential impact of uncertain tax benefits and the reduction of estimated penalties and interest of  related to the potential impact of uncertain tax positions 
the current tax provision is made up of a benefit of approximately million in united states taxes and approximately million payable to foreign jurisdictions  primarily the united kingdom  singapore and russia 
our provision for income taxes in fiscal amounted to approximately million 
this amount included current taxes of million  deferred taxes of million  a benefit of million related to the recognition of certain tax benefits and estimated penalties and interest of  related to the potential impact of uncertain tax positions 
the current tax provision is made up of approximately  in united states taxes and approximately million payable to foreign jurisdictions  primarily australia  singapore and russia 
income taxes currently payable in the united states were reduced by approximately  due to deductions arising from the exercise of non qualified stock options 
this amount did not reduce our current tax provision but is credited directly to paid in capital in accordance with the provisions of asc the million tax benefit was recognized upon the resolution of specific uncertain tax positions 
this uncertainty was resolved upon the expiration of the period in which certain of our us tax returns could be examined by the irs 
in accordance with the provisions asc we have estimated the amount of penalties and interest that might accrue during the period should certain uncertain tax positions be resolved not in our favor 
this amount is recorded as income tax expense 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity and capital over the past three fiscal years has been cash flows provided by operating activities and our revolving credit agreement 
the principal factor that has affected our cash flows is in the level of oil and gas exploration and development activities as discussed above 
as of january   we had working capital of approximately million and cash and cash equivalents of approximately million  as compared to working capital of approximately million and cash and temporary investments of approximately million at january  our working capital increased from january  to january  primarily due to working capital generated by operations and from the use of proceeds from our revolving credit facility to reduce accounts payable 
the accounts payable arose primarily from the purchase of lease pool equipment 
cash flows provided by operating activities amounted to approximately million in fiscal as compared to approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the primary sources of cash provided by operating activities were net income of million and non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization totaling approximately million  provision for doubtful accounts of approximately million and stock based compensation of approximately million 
these were offset by non operating cash items consisting of the gain from bargain purchase of approximately million and the gross profit from the sale of lease pool equipment of approximately million 
the net change in other current assets and liabilities increased net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal by approximately million 
the most significant items contributing to this decrease in net cash provided by operating activities were a decrease in trade accounts and contracts receivable of approximately million and net receipt of approximately million related to income taxes 
in fiscal  and  we acquired approximately million  million and million  respectively  of new lease pool equipment  however  the cash expenditures for these purchases did not all occur within those respective periods 
as of january   our accounts payable included approximately million related to lease pool purchases 
as of january   the amount in accounts payable related to lease pool 
table of contents purchases was approximately million  while the comparable amount as of january  was approximately million 
accordingly  our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended january   and indicated purchases of equipment held for lease of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
subsequent to january  we have purchased  or committed to purchase  approximately million of additional lease pool equipment 
cash flows from investing activities for each of the three fiscal years   and reflect proceeds of approximately million  million and million  respectively  from the sale of used lease pool equipment 
we generally do not seek to sell our lease pool equipment  however  from time to time we will do so in response to particular customer demand 
in determining whether or not to sell lease pool equipment  we weigh expected future leasing revenues from that equipment versus the potential proceeds that may be received upon the sale of the equipment 
during fiscal we expended approximately million related to the acquisition of aes 
in fiscal  we received an insurance settlement of approximately million arising from the destruction of equipment during hurricane ike 
included within financing activities are net borrowings under our revolving line of credit of approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the proceeds from these borrowings are used primarily to temporarily finance purchases of new lease pool equipment 
in fiscal we entered into a note payable with an equipment supplier in the amount of approximately million in connection with the purchase of certain lease pool equipment 
payments on borrowings in fiscal represent installment payments made on this obligation 
financing activities also include the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options 
these transactions resulted in cash infusions of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  sap purchased approximately million in short term investments  consisting of time deposits with an australian bank 
these deposits were then pledged as collateral for performance bonds issued in connection with sap s contract with the australian government 
approximately  and  of these investments were redeemed in fiscal and  respectively  as the collateral was released 
due to the financing nature of this transaction  the purchase of the temporary investments is reflected within cash flows from financing activities 
in connection with the temporary importation of our lease pool equipment into some countries we are required to post import bonds with the customs authorities of that country 
these bonds are normally provided by local insurance or surety companies 
in some cases the surety requires that we post collateral to secure our obligations under the bonds 
as of april   we have provided stand by letters of credit totaling approximately million as security for customs bonds 
in july  we entered into an amended revolving credit agreement with first victoria national bank the bank  which provides for borrowings of up to million 
amounts available for borrowing are determined by a borrowing base 
the borrowing base is computed based upon eligible accounts receivable and eligible lease pool assets 
based upon the latest calculation of the borrowing base we believe that the entire million of the facility is available to us  less amounts outstanding as described below 
the revolving credit agreement matures on may  however  at any time prior to that maturity  we can convert any or all outstanding balances into a series of month notes 
the agreement provides that up to million of the amount available for borrowing may be used to secure letters of credit 
the credit agreement is secured by essentially all of our domestic assets 
interest is payable monthly at the prime rate plus basis points 
the credit agreement also provides that we may not incur or maintain indebtedness in excess of million without the prior written consent of the bank  except for borrowings related to the credit agreement 
as of april   we had approximately million outstanding under this agreement and million of the facility had been reserved to support outstanding letters of credit 
accordingly  approximately million was available under the facility as of that date 
the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants that require us  among other things  to maintain a maximum debt to shareholders equity ratio  maintain a minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities ratio and produce quarterly earnings before interest  
table of contents taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda of not less than a specified amount 
we are in compliance with all of these covenants as more fully described as follows actual as of january  description of or for financial covenant required amount period then ended ratio of debt to shareholder s equity not more than ratio of current assets to current liabilities not less than quarterly ebitda not less than million million under the terms of the revolving credit facility we may convert any outstanding balances into a series of month notes 
we do not currently anticipate utilizing this option  but if we were to do so we would be required to make monthly payments to amortize these notes 
as of january   there was approximately million outstanding under this facility 
if we were to convert the entire amount into month notes  our required monthly principal payments would be approximately  we would also be required to make monthly interest payments on the remaining principal balance at the then prime rate plus basis points 
our average borrowing levels under our revolving credit agreement for each of the years ended january   and were   and  respectively 
in october  in connection with the purchase of certain lease pool equipment  we entered into a secured promissory note with a supplier in the amount of approximately million 
the note is repayable in monthly installments  bears interest at annually and is secured by the equipment purchased 
pursuant to the terms of our revolving credit agreement we sought and received the consent of the bank for this transaction 
on march   we acquired aes for a total purchase price of approximately million 
the consideration consisted of approximately million of cash at closing  approximately million in promissory notes and approximately  in deferred cash payments 
the promissory notes bear interest at annually  payable semi annually 
the principal amount of the notes is repayable in two equal installments on march  and the deferred cash payments will be made upon the expiration of certain indemnity periods 
the deferred cash payment bears interest at annually 
we may offset amounts due pursuant to the promissory notes or the deferred cash payments against indemnity claims due from the sellers 
in addition  the sellers may be entitled to additional cash payments of up to approximately  should aes attain certain levels of revenues during the month period following the closing 
pursuant to our exclusive equipment lease agreement with sercel  see part i item business  we have agreed to purchase certain amounts of equipment through december  as of january   we had purchased or placed non cancellable orders for a portion of that equipment  which amounts are reflected in the table of contractual obligations below 
in order to fulfill the required purchases under the agreement  we will be required to place orders for approximately million of additional equipment through december  should we fail to meet these obligations  sercel will have the right to terminate the agreement  including our exclusive referral arrangement 
we are negotiating an amendment and extension to this agreement  however  there can be no assurance that we will successfully conclude these negotiations 
the following table sets forth estimates of future payments of our consolidated contractual obligations as of january  in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total 
table of contents at january   we had unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million related to uncertain tax positions  including approximately million of non current income taxes payable 
we are not able to reasonably estimate when  if ever  these obligations will be paid 
we believe that our liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand  cash provided by operating activities and from proceeds of our existing working capital facility 
however  should our needs for liquidity increase or should we decide to repay all  or a portion of  our revolving credit agreement  we may seek to issue other debt or equity securities 
in march  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec 
upon effectiveness  we may issue from time to time up to million in common stock  warrants  preferred stock  debt securities or any combination thereof under the shelf registration statement 
we currently have no plans to issue any such securities 
as of january   we had deposits in foreign banks equal to approximately million 
these funds may generally be transferred to our accounts in the united states without restriction 
however  the transfer of these funds may result in withholding taxes payable to foreign taxing authorities 
any such transfer taxes generally may be credited against our federal income tax obligations in the united states 
additionally  the transfer of funds from our foreign subsidiaries to the united states may result in currently taxable income in the united states 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a ii of regulation s k 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
significant estimates made by us in the accompanying consolidated financial statements relate to the allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable and inventory obsolescence  the useful lives of our lease pool assets and amortizable intangible assets and the impairment assessments of our lease pool and various intangible assets 
other areas where we have made significant estimates include the valuation of stock options  the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets and the assessment of uncertain tax positions 
critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial position and results of operations and require management s subjective judgment 
below is a brief discussion of our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition leases we recognize lease revenue ratably over the term of the lease unless there is a question as to whether it is collectible 
we do not enter into leases with embedded maintenance obligations 
under our standard lease  the customer is responsible for maintenance and repairs to the equipment  excluding normal wear and tear 
we provide technical advice to our customers as part of our customer service practices 
in most situations  our customers pay shipping and handling costs directly to the shipping agents 
equipment sales we recognize revenue and cost of goods sold from equipment sales upon agreement of terms and when delivery has occurred  unless there is a question as to its collectability 
we occasionally offer extended payment terms on equipment sales transactions 
these terms are generally one to two years in duration 
long term project revenue from time to time  sap enters into contracts whereby it assembles and sales certain marine equipment  primarily to governmental entities 
performance under these contracts generally occurs over a period of several months 
revenue and costs related to these contracts are accounted for under the percentage of completion method 
service agreements seamap provides on going support services pursuant to contracts that generally have a term of months 
we recognize revenue from these contracts over the term of the contract 
in some cases we will provide support services on a time and material basis 
revenue from these arrangements is 
table of contents recognized as the services are provided 
for certain new systems that seamap sells  we provide support services for up to months at no additional charge 
any amounts attributable to these support obligations are immaterial 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make provisions to the allowance for doubtful accounts based on a detailed review of outstanding receivable balances 
factors considered include the age of the receivable  the payment history of the customer  the general financial condition of the customer and any financial or operational leverage we may have in a particular situation 
we typically do not charge fees on past due accounts  although we reserve the right to do so in most of our contractual arrangements with our customers 
as of january   the average age of our accounts receivable was approximately days 
long lived assets we carry our lease pool of equipment and other property and equipment at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  and compute depreciation on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the property and equipment  which range from two to years 
cables are depreciated over two years  geophones over three years  channel boxes over five to seven years and earth vibrators and other heavy equipment are depreciated over a year period 
buildings are depreciated over years  property improvements are amortized over years and leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of useful life and the life of the lease 
intangible assets are amortized from three to years 
the estimated useful lives for rental equipment are based on our experience as to the economic useful life of our products 
we review and consider industry trends in determining the appropriate useful life for our lease pool equipment  including technological obsolescence  market demand and actual historical useful service life of our lease pool equipment 
additionally  to the extent information is available publicly  we compare our depreciation policies to those of other companies in our industry for reasonableness 
when we purchase new equipment for our lease pool  we begin to depreciate it upon its first use and depreciation continues each month until the equipment is fully depreciated  whether or not the equipment is actually in use during that entire time period 
our policy regarding the removal of assets that are fully depreciated from our books is the following if an asset is fully depreciated and is still expected to generate revenue  then the asset will remain on our books 
however  if a fully depreciated asset is not expected to have any revenue generating capacity  then it is removed from our books 
in accordance with asc  impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we annually assess our lease pool equipment for potential impairment 
this analysis compares the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by these assets to the carrying value of the seismic equipment lease pool 
such analysis indicated that no impairment was required during fiscal  or additionally  we assess the need for impairment of our seismic equipment lease pool upon changes in circumstances that might indicate the carrying value of the assets is not recoverable 
such changes in circumstances might include a material decline in the demand for and cash flow generated by the equipment or technological advances that render a portion of the equipment obsolete 
see part item a risk factors 
goodwill and other intangible assets we carry our amortizable intangible assets at cost  net of accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed on a straight line method over the estimated life of the asset 
currently  proprietary rights are amortized over a to year period  while covenants not to compete are amortized over a three year period 
the basis for the proprietary right lives are generally based upon the results of valuation reports commissioned from third parties 
covenants not to compete are amortized over the term of the contract 
goodwill is not subject to systematic amortization  but rather is tested for impairment annually 
under asc  intangibles goodwill and other  we perform an impairment test on goodwill and other intangibles on an annual basis and at any time circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred 
impairment testing compares the carrying amount of the goodwill and other intangible assets with their fair value 

table of contents when the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recorded 
all of our goodwill and other intangible assets relate to our seamap segment and we have determined that our seamap segment is the reporting unit for purposes of impairment testing 
accordingly  we estimate fair value based upon estimated discounted cash flows of that segment 
as of january  goodwill amounted to approximately million 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
in performing the analysis of discounted cash flows  we projected cash flow from the seamap segment for the next four fiscal years 
to determine the value of cash flows beyond the fourth year  we applied a terminal value which is expressed as a multiple of the fourth year s cash flow 
these cash flow streams are then discounted using our estimated cost of capital 
the key variables utilized in this analysis are i the level of projected cash flows  including the growth rate for the cash flows  ii the terminal value applied to the estimated cash flows and iii our cost of capital 
the sensitivity of the estimated fair value to changes in these assumptions is indicated in the following table variable decrease in fair value decrease in projected annual cash flow million decrease in terminal value applied to the million estimated fourth year cash flow basis point increase in cost of capital million these changes in assumptions  individually and in the aggregate  would not have altered our conclusion that there was no impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets as of january  the level of projected cash flows used in this analysis is consistent with historical results 
however  any developments or circumstances that would materially adversely impact the results of our seamap segment could have a material adverse effect on the estimated fair value 
such developments could include a material decline in demand for marine seismic equipment or other risk factors affecting our seamap segment 
see part item a risk factors 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
we have assessed  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
under asc  income taxes asc  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists i the more positive evidence is necessary and ii the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that we consider are taxable income projections in future years  whether the carry forward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits  future sales and operating cost projections that will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset based on existing sales prices and cost structures  and our earnings history exclusive of the loss that created the future deductible amount coupled with evidence indicating that the loss is an aberration rather than a continuing condition 
in determining the valuation allowance  we consider the following positive indicators the current level of worldwide oil and gas exploration activities resulting from historically high prices for oil and natural gas  increasing world demand for oil  
table of contents our recent history of profitable operations in various jurisdictions  our anticipated positive income in various jurisdictions  and our existing customer relationships 
we also considered the following negative indicators the risk of the world oil supply increasing  thereby depressing the price of oil and natural gas  the risk of decreased global demand for oil  and the potential for increased competition in the seismic equipment leasing and sales business 
based on our evaluation of the evidence  as of january  and we did not provided a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with asc is a two step process 
in the first step  we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
in the second step  a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in an increase in a liability for income taxes payable or a reduction of an income tax refund receivable or a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability or both and 
the evaluation of tax positions and the measurement of the related benefit require significant judgment on the part of management 
we adopted provisions of the authoritative guidance included in acs effective february  as a result of the adoption we recorded a reduction in our deferred tax assets in the amount of approximately million  recognized a liability for unrecognized tax benefits of approximately million and decreased the february  balance in retained earnings by approximately million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation effective february   we adopted the provisions of authoritative guidance included in asc compensation stock compensation asc  using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  stock based compensation expense recognized for share based awards includes i compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  february   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with authoritative guidance in effect prior to february of  and ii compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to february   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of authoritative guidance included in asc determining the grant date fair value under both asc and prior authoritative guidance requires management to make estimates regarding the variables used in the calculation of the grant date fair value 
those variables are the future volatility of our common stock price  the length of time an optionee will hold their options until exercising them the expected term  and the number of options or shares that will be forfeited before they are exercised the forfeiture rate 
we utilize various mathematical models in calculating the variables 
share based compensation expense could be different if we used different models to calculate the variables

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk  which is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
we have not entered  nor do we intend to enter  into derivative financial instruments for hedging or speculative purposes 
foreign currency risk we operate in a number of foreign locations  which gives rise to risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
to the extent possible  we attempt to denominate our transactions in foreign locations in us dollars 
for those cases in which transactions are not denominated in us dollars  we are exposed to risk from changes in exchange rates to the extent that non us dollar revenues exceed non us dollar expenses related to those operations 
our non us dollar transactions are denominated primarily in british pounds sterling  russian rubles  canadian dollars  australian dollars and singapore dollars 
as a result of these transactions  we generally hold cash balances that are denominated in these foreign currencies 
at january   our consolidated cash and cash equivalents included foreign currency denominated amounts equivalent to approximately million in us dollars 
a increase in the us dollar as compared to each of these currencies would result in a loss of approximately  in the us dollar value of these deposits  while a decrease would result in an equal amount of gain 
we do not currently hold or issue foreign exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge these exposures 
some of our foreign operations are conducted through wholly owned foreign subsidiaries that have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
we currently have subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the canadian dollar  british pound sterling  russian ruble  australian dollar and the singapore dollar 
assets and liabilities from these subsidiaries are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date 
the resulting translation gains or losses are reflected as accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of our consolidated balance sheets 
approximately of our net assets were impacted by changes in foreign currencies in relation to the us dollar 
during the year ended january   the us dollar generally decreased in value versus the above currencies 
as a result of this decline  we have recognized an increase of approximately million in accumulated other comprehensive income  primarily related to changes in the relative exchange rate of the us dollar against the canadian dollar  british pound sterling and the australian dollar 
interest rate risk as of january  there was approximately million outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
this agreement contains a floating interest rate based on the prime rate plus basis points which was as of january  assuming the outstanding balance remains unchanged  a change of basis points in the prime rate would result in an increase in annual interest expense of approximately  we have not entered into interest rate hedging arrangements in the past  and have no plans to do so 
do to fluctuating balances in the amount outstanding under this debt agreement we do not believe such arrangements to be cost effective
