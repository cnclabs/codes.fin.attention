item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements  the realization of which may be impacted by certain important factors including  but not limited to  those risk factors disclosed pursuant to part  item a 
introduction and overview powerwave is a global supplier of end to end wireless solutions for wireless communications networks 
our business consists of the design  manufacture  marketing and sale of products to improve coverage  capacity and data speed in wireless communications networks  including antennas  boosters  combiners  cabinets  shelters  filters  radio frequency power amplifiers  remote radio head transceivers  repeaters  tower mounted amplifiers and advanced coverage solutions 
these products are utilized in major wireless networks throughout the world which support voice and data communications by use of wireless phones and other wireless communication devices 
we sell our products to both original equipment manufacturers  who incorporate our products into their proprietary base stations which they then sell to wireless network operators  and d irectly to individual wireless network operators for deployment into their existing networks 
during the last ten years  demand for wireless communications infrastructure equipment has fluctuated dramatically 
while demand for wireless infrastructure was strong during  it weakened for powerwave during and due to significant reductions at three major customers  as well as a general slowdown in overall demand within the wireless infrastructure industry 
for most of  demand once again increased 
however  in the fourth quarter of  demand for our products was negatively impacted by the global economic recession 
this significantly impacted demand during and our revenues fell by from levels  thus negatively impacting our financial results 
during and  we initiated several cost cutting measures aimed at lowering our operating expenses 
during  demand began to improve and revenues grew by from levels 
we may be required to further reduce operating expenses if there is a significant or prolonged reduction in spending by our customers 
in the past  there have been significant deferrals in capital spending by wireless network operators due to delays in the expected deployment of infrastructure equipment and financial difficulties on the part of the wireless network operators who were forced to consolidate and reduce spending to strengthen their balance sheets and improve their profitability 
economic conditions  such as the turmoil in the global equity and credit markets  the recent global recession  continuing economic uncertainty  and the rise of inflationary pressures related to rising commodity prices  have also had a negative impact on capital spending by wireless network operators  and will likely have a negative impact going forward in the near term 
all of these factors can have a significant negative impact on overall demand for wireless infrastructure produ cts  and at various times  have directly reduced demand for our products and increased price competition within our industry  which has in the past led to reductions in our revenues and contributed to our reported operating losses 
in addition to the significant reduction in revenues during  an example of prior reductions was during fiscal and  when we experienced a significant slowdown in demand from one of our direct network operator customers  at t  as well as reduced demand from several of our original equipment manufacturing customers  including nokia siemens and nortel networks  all of which combined to result in directly reduced demand for our products and contributed to our operating losses for both fiscal and we believe that we have maintained our overall market share within the wireless communications infrastructure equipment market during this period of changing demand for wireless communications infrastructure equipment 
we continue to invest in the research and development of wireless communications network technology and the diversification of our product offerings  and we believe that we have one of our industry s leading product portfolios in terms of performance and features 
we believe that our proprietary design technology is a further differentiator for our products 
looking back over the last six years  beginning in fiscal  we focused on cost savings while we expanded our market presence  as evidenced by our acquisition of lgp allgon 
this acquisition involved the integration of two companies based in different countries that previously operated independently  which was a complex  costly and time consuming process 
during fiscal  we continued to focus on cost savings while we expanded our market presence  as evidenced by our acquisition of selected assets and liabilities of remec  inc s wireless systems business 
we believe that this acquisition further strengthened our position in the global wireless infrastructure market 
in october  we completed the acquisition of the wireless business of filtronic plc 
we believe that this strategic acquisition provided us wit h the leading position in transmit and receive filter products  as well as broadening our radio frequency rf conditioning and base station solutions product portfolio and added significant additional technology to our intellectual property portfolio 
during fiscal years  and  we completed the integration of this acquisition  as well as focused on consolidating operations and reducing our overall cost structure 
during this same time  we encountered a significant unanticipated reduction in revenues  which caused us to revise our integration and consolidation plans with a goal of further reducing our operating costs and significantly lowering our breakeven operating structure 
as has been demonstrated during the last six years  these acquisitions do not provide any guarantee that our revenues will increase 

table of contents we measure our success by monitoring our net sales by product and consolidated gross margins  with a short term goal of maintaining a positive operating cash flow while striving to achieve long term operating profits 
we believe that there continues to be long term growth opportunities within the wireless communications infrastructure marketplace  and we are focused on positioning powerwave to benefit from these long term opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information currently available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a material change to our reported amounts of revenue  expenses  assets and liabilities 
the critical accounting policies that we believe are the most significant for purposes of fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is derived from the sale of products 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment or delivery and passage of title depending upon the terms of the sale  provided that persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
we offer certain customers the right to return products within a limited time after delivery under specified circumstances  generally related to product defects 
we monitor and track product returns and record a provision for the estimated amount of future returns based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns 
while returns have historically been within our expectations and the provision s established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant increase in product returns could have a material adverse effect on our operating results for the period or periods in which these returns materialize 
a portion of our sales involve contracts that may include the design  customization  implementation and installation of wireless coverage applications utilizing our coverage solution products 
we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method for these types of arrangements 
we measure progress towards completion by comparing actual costs incurred to total planned project costs 
such sales have not historically been a significant amount of our total sales 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon each customer s payment history and credit worthiness  as well as various other factors as determined by our review of their credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
since our accounts receivable are highly concentrated in a small number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the collectability of our accounts receivable  our liquidity and our future operating results 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost determined on an average cost basis or fair market value and include materials  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we write down excess and obsolete inventory to estimated net realizable value 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare those requirements with the current or committed inventory levels 
depending on the product line and other factors  we estimate future demand based on either historical usage for the preceding twelve months  adjusted for known changes in demand for such products  or the forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
these provisions reduce the cost basis of the respective inventory and are recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
our industry is char acterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
as demonstrated during the past seven fiscal years  demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize additional charges in our cost of goods sold at the time of this determination 
likewise  if our inventory is determined to be undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sol d in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional gross profit at the time such inventory is sold 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a material effect on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 

table of contents income taxes we provide for income taxes based on the estimated effective income tax rate for the complete fiscal year 
the income tax provision benefit is computed on the pretax income loss of the consolidated entities located within each taxing jurisdiction based on current tax law 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the future tax consequences associated with temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial accounting and tax reporting purposes 
in accordance with the provisions of accounting guidance now codified as financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic  income taxes  a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets is recorded to the extent we cannot determine that the ultimate realization of the net deferred tax assets is more likely than not 
realization of deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon the achievement of future taxable income  the estimation of which requires significant management judgment 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors  including future market conditions and our ability to successfully execute our business plans and or tax planning strategies 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of our cumulative federal and state net operating losses  we have recorded a valuation allowance against a portion of our gross deferred tax assets 
for the foreseeable future  the federal tax provision related to future earnings will be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation reserve  and any future pretax losse s will not result in a tax benefit due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
accordingly  current and future tax expense will consist primarily of certain required state income taxes and taxes in certain foreign jurisdictions 
acquired tax liabilities related to prior tax returns of acquired entities at the date of purchase are recognized based on our estimate of the ultimate settlement that may be accepted by the tax authorities 
we continually evaluate these tax related matters 
at the date of any material change in our estimate of items relating to an acquired entity s prior tax returns  and at the date that the items are settled with the tax authorities  any liabilities previously recognized are adjusted to increase or decrease the remaining balance of goodwill attributable to that acquisition 
however  effective beginning in  adjustments to acquired tax liabilities will increase or decrease income tax expense in accordance with accounting guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  co nsolidation 
accounting guidance now codified as fasb asc topic  income taxes intraperiod tax allocation  clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fasb asc topic seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to the provisions of fasb asc topic and have analyzed filing positions in all of the federal  state and foreign jurisdictions where we are required to file income tax returns for all open tax years in these jurisdictions 
the periods subject to examination for our us federal return are the through tax years  including adjustments to net operating loss and credit carryovers to those years 
in addition  we have subsidiaries in various foreign jurisdictions that have statutes of limitation generally ranging from to years 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
vendor cancellation liabilities we purchase subassemblies and finished goods from contract manufacturers under purchase agreements that limit our ability to cancel deliveries inside defined lead time windows 
when a contract manufacturer submits a cancellation claim  we estimate the amount of inventory remaining to be purchased against that claim 
any excess of the estimated purchase over the projected consumption of the related product is recorded as a charge to cost of sales and an increase to accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
depending on the product line and other factors  we estimate future demand based on either historical usage for the preceding twelve months  adjusted for known changes in demand for such products  or the forecast of product demands and production requirements for the next twelve months 
our indu stry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of vendor cancellation liability 
our history shows that demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of vendor cancellation liabilities 
in addition  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for vendor cancellation liabilities 
although we make reasonable efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a material effect on the amount of vendor cancellation liabilities and our reported operating results 

table of contents warranties we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective product returned to us during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for standard warranty related costs based on our historical return rates and repair costs at the time of the sale and update these estimates throughout the warranty period 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
we also have contractual commitments to various customers that require us to incur costs to repair an epidemic defect with respect to ou r products outside of our standard warranty period if such defect were to occur 
any costs related to epidemic defects are generally recorded at the time the epidemic defect becomes known to us and the costs of repair can be reasonably estimated 
while we have occasionally experienced significant costs due to epidemic defects in the past  we have not regularly experienced significant costs related to epidemic defects 
we cannot guarantee that we will not experience significant costs to repair epidemic defects in the future 
a significant increase in product return rates or in the costs to repair our products  or an unexpected epidemic defect in our products  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results during the period in which the returns or additional costs materialize 
accruals for restructuring and impairment charges we recorded million  million and million of restructuring and impairment charges during fiscal years  and  respectively 
the charges include million related to the impairment of goodwill and million related to the impairment of our intangible assets 
see further discussions of these charges under cost of sales  gross profit and operating expenses below and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring plan in january  we formulated and began to implement a plan to further reduce manufacturing overhead costs and operating expenses restructuring plan 
as part of this plan  we initiated personnel reductions at both domestic and foreign locations  with primary reductions in the united states  finland and sweden 
these reductions were undertaken in response to economic conditions and the global recession that began in the fourth quarter of we finalized this plan in the fourth quarter of and additional amounts were accrued in related to actions associated with this plan 
a summary of the activity affecting our accrued restructuring liability related to the restructuring plan for the fiscal year ended january  is as follows workforce reductions facility closures equipment write downs total balance at january  amounts accrued amounts paid incurred effects of exchange rates balance at january  the costs associated with these exit activities were recorded in accordance with the accounting guidance for exit or disposal obligations 
pursuant to this guidance  a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity shall be recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred  except for a liability for one time employee termination benefits that is incurred over time 
in the unusual circumstance in which fair value cannot be reasonably estimated  the liability shall be recognized initially in the period in which fair value can be reasonably estimated 
the restructuring and integration plan is subject to continued future refinement as additional information becomes available 
we expect that the workforce reduction amo unts will be paid through the first quarter of restructuring plan in june  we formulated and began to implement a plan to consolidate operations and reduce manufacturing and operating expenses restructuring plan 
as part of this plan  we closed our salisbury  maryland manufacturing facility and transferred most of the production to our other manufacturing operations 
in addition  we closed our design and development center in bristol  uk and discontinued manufacturing operations in kempele  finland 
these actions were finalized in the first quarter of 
table of contents a summary of the activity affecting our accrued restructuring liability related to the restructuring plan for the fiscal year ended january  is as follows workforce reductions facility closures equipment write downs total balance at january  amounts accrued amounts paid incurred effects of exchange rates balance at january  all actions associated with this plan were completed in the fourth quarter of integration of lgp allgon and remec  inc s wireless systems business the company recorded liabilities in connection with the acquisitions for estimated restructuring and integration costs related to the consolidation of lgp allgon s operations and remec  inc s wireless systems business  including severance and future lease obligations on excess facilities 
these estimated costs were included in the allocation of the purchase consideration and resulted in additional goodwill 
the implementation of the restructuring and integration plan is complete 
a summary of the activity affecting our accrued restructuring liability related to the integration of the remec  inc s wireless systems business and lgp allgon for the fiscal year ended january  is as follows facility closures equipment write downs balance at january  amounts accrued amounts paid incurred effects of exchange rates balance at january  we expect that the facility closure amounts will be paid out over the remaining lease term which extends through january all of these restructuring and impairment accruals related primarily to workforce reductions  consolidation of facilities  and the discontinuation of certain product lines  including the associated write downs of inventory  manufacturing and test equipment  and certain intangible assets 
such accruals were based on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters which were uncertain at the time  including the timing and amount of sublease income that would be recovered on vacated property and the net realizable value of used equipment that is no longer needed in our continuing operations 
while we used our best current estimates based on facts and circumstances available at the time to quantify these charges  different estimates could reasonably be used in the relevant periods to arrive at different accruals and or the actu al amounts incurred or recovered may be substantially different from the assumptions utilized  either of which could have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition or results of operations for a given period 
as a result  we periodically review the estimates and assumptions used and reflect the effects of those revisions in the period that they become known 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an update to accounting standards codification asc topic  revenue recognition 
this accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  provides accounting principles and application guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated 
this guidance eliminates the requirement to establish the fair value of undelivered products and services and instead provides for separate revenue recognition based upon management s estimate of the sellin g price for an undelivered item when there is no other means to determine the fair value of that undelivered item 
previous accounting guidance required that the fair value of the undelivered item be the price of the item either sold in a separate transaction between unrelated third parties or the price charged for each item when the item is sold separately by the vendor 
this was difficult to determine when the product was not individually sold because of its unique features 
under previous accounting guidance  if the fair value of all of the elements in the arrangement was not determinable  then revenue was deferred until all of the items were delivered or fair value was determined 
in october  the fasb issued an update to asc topic  software 
this asu no 
 software certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  modifies the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
these new updates are effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  early adoption is permitted 
the company does not believe that these standards will have a material affect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

table of contents years ended january  and january  net sales our sales are derived from the sale of wireless communications network products and coverage solutions  including antennas  boosters  combiners  cabinets  shelters  filters  radio frequency power amplifiers  remote radio head transceivers  repeaters  tower mounted amplifiers and advanced coverage solutions for use in cellular  pcs  g  and g wireless communications networks throughout the world 
the following table presents an analysis of our sales based upon our various customer groups fiscal year ended in thousands customer group january  january  wireless network operators and other original equipment manufacturers total sales increased by to million for the fiscal year ended january   from million for the fiscal year ended january  the increase was primarily due to the increase in direct sales to wireless network operators and others  offset by the decrease in demand from our original equipment manufacturer customers 
the global recession and associated tight credit markets impacted both fiscal years sales and our strategy of focusing our sales efforts on higher margin product and solution sales contributed to the reduction in demand from original equipment manufacturers during overall  the first quarter of was our low point in terms of quarterly revenue  reaching only million compared to million for the first quarter of our fiscal s ales also were impacted by component supply constraints which have been reduced significantly by the end of fiscal the following table presents an analysis of our sales based upon our various product groups fiscal year ended in thousands wireless communications product group january  january  antenna systems base station systems coverage systems total antenna systems consist of base station antennas and tower mounted amplifiers 
base station systems consist of products that are installed into or around the base station of wireless networks and include products such as boosters  combiners  filters  radio frequency power amplifiers  versaflex cabinets and radio transceivers 
coverage systems consist primarily of repeaters and advanced coverage solutions 
the increase in antenna system sales is primarily due to the increase in our sales directly to wireless network operators  who traditionally purchase antenna products directly from suppliers as opposed to original equipment manufacturers 
the reduction in base station sales during is primarily related to our reduced sales to original equipment manufacturers who traditionally are the primary sellers of these types of p roducts to wireless network operators 
the global recession and associated tight credit markets impacted both fiscal years sales and our strategy of focusing our sales efforts on higher margin product and solution sales contributed to the reduction in demand for base station systems during 
table of contents we track the geographic location of our sales based upon the location of our customers to which we ship our products 
however  since many of our original equipment manufacturer customers purchase products from us at central locations and then re ship the product with other base station equipment to locations throughout the world  we are unable to identify the final installation location of many of our products 
the following table presents an analysis of our sales based upon the geographic area to which a product was shipped fiscal year ended in thousands geographic area january  january  americas asia pacific europe other international total revenues increased in the americas region during fiscal due to increased demand from wireless network operators who increased their infrastructure spending plans in preparation for and as part of g network deployments or upgrades 
this was offset by a decrease in the asia pacific and other international regions in as compared with the decrease in these regions was largely due to contraction in our original equipment manufacturer sales channel  resulting from reduced network operator demand due to the global recession and our strategy of not pursuing low margin  commodity type business 
since wireless network infrastructure spending is dependent on individual network coverage and capacity demands  we do not believe that our revenue fluctuations for any geographic region are necessarily indicative of a trend for our fut ure revenues by geographic area 
in addition  as previously noted  growth in one geographic location may not reflect actual demand growth in that location due to the centralized buying processes of our original equipment manufacturer customers 
a large portion of our revenues are generated in currencies other than the us dollar 
during the last year  the value of the us dollar has fluctuated significantly against many other currencies 
we have calculated the impact of exchange rates in effect for the year ended january  to those in effect for the year ended january   and the change in the value of foreign currencies as compared with the us dollar had a negative impact on our revenues for fiscal of less than one percent 
this impact did not have a material impact on our sales 
we are unable to predict the future impact of such currency fluctuations on our future results 
for the year ended january   total sales to nokia siemens accounted for approximately of sales for the year 
for the year ended january   total sales to nokia siemens accounted for approximately of sales 
no other single direct customer accounted for more than of revenue in either year 
our business remains largely dependent upon a limited number of customers within the wireless communications market  and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be successful in attracting new customers or retaining or increasing business with our existing customers 
a number of factors have caused delays and may cause future delays in new wireless infrastructure and upgrade deployment schedules throughout the world  including those in the united states  europe  asia  south america and other areas 
in addition  a number of factors may cause original equipment manufacturers to alter their outsourcing strategies concerning certain wireless communications network products  which could cause such original equipment manufacturers to reduce or eliminate their demand for external supplies of such products or shift their demand to alternative suppliers or internal suppliers 
such factors include lower perceived internal manufacturing costs and competitive reasons to remain vertically integrated 
additionally  wireless network operators may choose to further consolidate their purchase of products to single sources or consolidators  which could cause a reduction in our revenue or reduced pricing for our products 
due to the possible uncertainties associated with wireless infrastructure deployments and customer demand  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience significant fluctuations in demand from both our original equipment manufacturer and network operator customers 
such fluctuations have caused and may continue to cause significant reductions in our revenues and or operating results  which has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents cost of sales and gross profit our cost of sales includes both fixed and variable cost components and consists primarily of materials  assembly and test labor  overhead which includes equipment and facility depreciation  transportation costs  warranty costs and amortization of product related intangibles 
components of our fixed cost structure include test equipment and facility depreciation  purchasing and procurement expenses and quality assurance costs 
given the fixed nature of such costs  typically the absorption of our overhead costs into inventory decreases and the amount of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales increases as manufacturing volumes decline  since we have fewer units to absorb our overhead costs against 
conversely  the absorption of our overhead costs into inventory increases and the amount of overhead variances expensed to cost of sa les decreases as volumes increase  since we have more units to absorb our overhead costs against 
as a result  our gross profit margins generally decrease as revenue and manufacturing volumes decline due to higher amounts of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales 
our gross profit margins generally increase as our revenue and manufacturing volumes increase due to lower amounts of overhead variances expensed to cost of sales 
the following table presents an analysis of our gross profit fiscal year ended in thousands january  january  net sales cost of sales cost of sales intangible amortization restructuring and impairment charges total cost of sales gross profit our total gross profit and gross profit percentage increased during fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of our increased revenues and the impact of our prior cost reduction and restructuring actions 
our cost reduction activities  which included manufacturing plant consolidations and closures  helped to reduce our fixed costs and manufacturing cost overheads  which contributed to the improved gross margin 
the decrease in intangible amortization costs in is due to our intangible assets being fully amortized in we incurred approximately million of restructuring and impairment charges in cost of sales during fiscal primarily related to severance  inventory and facility related charges in estonia as we closed our manufacturing facility and consolidated the activities into other locations 
we incurred approximately million of restructuring and impairment charges in cost of sales during fiscal  primarily related to severance charges in the united states  finland  sweden and the uk 
included in cost of sales was stock based compensation expense of million and million for fiscal and respectively for stock options and employee stock purchase plans 
the wireless communications infrastructure equipment industry is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  new product development and product obsolescence  evolving industry standards and significant price erosion over the life of a product 
certain of our competitors have aggressively lowered prices in an attempt to gain market share 
due to these competitive pressures and the pressures of our customers to continually lower product costs  we expect that the average sales prices of our products will continue to decrease and negatively impact our gross margins 
in addition  we have introduced new products at lower sales prices and these lower sales prices have impacted the average sales prices of our products 
we have also reduced prices on our existing products in response to our competitors and custom er demands 
we currently expect that pricing pressures will remain strong in our industry 
future pricing actions by our competitors and us may adversely impact our gross profit margins and profitability  which could result in decreased liquidity and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we continue to strive for manufacturing and engineering cost reductions to offset pricing pressures on our products  as evidenced by our prior decisions to close and consolidate several of our manufacturing locations as part of our restructuring plans to reduce our manufacturing costs over the last three years 
however  we cannot guarantee that these cost reductions and our outsourcing or product redesign efforts will keep pace with price declines and cost increases 
if we are unable to further reduce our costs through our manufacturing  outsourcing and or engineering efforts  our gross margins and profitability will be adversely affected 
see our average sales prices have declined and our reliance on contract manufacturers exposes us to risks under part i  item a  risk factors 

table of contents operating expenses the following table presents a breakdown of our operating expenses by functional category and as a percentage of net sales fiscal year ended in thousands january  january  operating expenses sales and marketing research and development general and administrative intangible amortization restructuring and impairment charges total operating expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and sales commissions  travel expenses  advertising and marketing expenses  selling expenses  customer demonstration unit expenses and trade show expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease was due primarily to lower commissions and reduced bad debt expense 
research and development expenses consist primarily of ongoing design and development expenses for new wireless communications network products  as well as for advanced coverage solutions 
we also incur design expenses associated with reducing the cost and improving the manufacturability of our existing products 
research and development expenses can fluctuate dramatically from period to period depending on numerous factors including new product introduction schedules  prototype developments and hiring patterns 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  during fiscal as compared with fiscal  primarily due to higher personnel costs  higher incentive compensation and higher materials costs used in research and development activities  which were partially offset by lower professional fees for outsource d research and development activities 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other expenses for management  finance  information systems  legal fees  facilities and human resources 
general and administrative expenses decreased by million  or  during fiscal as compared to fiscal this decrease was due to lower tax and audit related fees and lower insurance costs 
these reductions were partially offset by higher incentive compensation 
included in total operating expenses is approximately million for compensation expense that was recognized during fiscal for restricted stock  stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards 
during fiscal  approximately million was recorded for similar expenses 
there was no amortization of customer related intangibles from our acquisitions for fiscal  compared with million for fiscal see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included under part ii
