table of contents results of operations compared with summary net income attributable to the company for increased four percent to a record million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  for below is a summary discussion of the major factors leading to the year over year changes in net sales  profits and expenses 
a detailed discussion of segment operating performance for follows the summary 
consolidated net sales for increased million  or percent  over net sales for higher average selling prices  higher sales volumes and the effects of foreign currency translation accounted for approximately million  million and million  respectively  of the year over year increase in net sales 
average selling prices increased due primarily to rising raw material costs 
sales volumes grew five percent  due to increases for both the surfactants and polymers segments 
specialty products reported a small year over year sales volume decrease 
operating income for improved by million  or three percent  over operating income for gross profit increased million  or one percent 
gross profits were up between years for polymers and specialty products  but down for surfactants 
higher raw material costs negatively impacted profit margins for both the surfactants and polymers segments 
in addition  gross profit included expenses related to a lockout of the hourly workers at the company s millsdale illinois manufacturing site 
a labor agreement dispute led to the lockout 
during the lockout period the plant was operated by salaried personnel 
the effects of foreign currency translation contributed million to the year over year consolidated gross profit improvement 
operating expenses declined million  or less than one percent  year over year due to the following marketing expenses decreased million  or less than one percent  year over year 
bad debt expense declined million  which reflected lower provision requirements throughout the company s global organization 
the lower bad debt expense was largely offset by increased salary expense  including increased headcount to support the acquisition in singapore 
administrative expenses declined million  or three percent  due to a million decline in environmental remediation expenses and a million reduction in deferred compensation expense 
the decrease in environmental remediation expenses resulted primarily from the reduction of the company s liabilities for the clean up costs at two sites 
the reduction in deferred compensation expense was primarily attributable to changes in the price of company common stock to which a large part of the deferred compensation obligation is tied 
see the overview and corporate expenses sections of this management discussion and analysis for further details 
the impact of the foregoing was partially offset by the first time consolidation of administrative expenses of the facilities in poland  singapore and philippines million and higher global consulting expenses million 

table of contents research and development expenses increased million  or five percent  primarily due to increased expenses for salaries  product testing and compliance and the registration of company products under europe s registration  evaluation  authorization and restriction of chemical substances reach regulation 
interest expense for was million  or one percent  higher than interest expense for higher average debt levels led to the increase 
the higher debt levels reflected million in new private placement notes entered into in june the company secured the additional long term notes to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment and to support global growth initiatives 
other debt obligations  including a seller financed agreement for the purchase of storage tanks in singapore and a build to suit obligation for a new warehouse at the company s millsdale plant  will also contribute to increased interest expense in future periods 
see the liquidity and capital resources section of this management discussion and analysis 
the loss from equity joint ventures  which includes results for the percent owned spi through july   when the company acquired controlling interest in spi and tiorco joint ventures  declined million between years 
equity in spi s income improved million year over year 
the improvement was attributable in part to higher sales volumes and margins 
in addition  the company recorded a million gain related to revaluing its original percent interest in the joint venture as part of the company s acquisition of controlling interest in spi 
the prior year spi results included approximately million of expense for the reserve of value added tax receivable balances that were in dispute with the philippine tax authorities 
the equity loss in tiorco increased million between years 
the company also sells surfactant products to tiorco and its customers 
the sales and resulting income from the sales are included in the company s surfactants segment operating results 
the other  net line item of the consolidated statement of income includes investment related income ie  dividends  interest and realized and unrealized gains and losses associated with the company s mutual fund assets held for the deferred compensation plans and foreign exchange gains and losses 
other  net was income of million for compared to income of million for most of the decline was attributable to investment related income that was million lower in than in the effective tax rate was percent in compared to percent in the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily attributable to a lower tax benefit realized on foreign joint venture equity income and tax provided on a dividend from the company s subsidiary in colombia 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in the domestic production activities deduction 
higher illinois corporate income tax rates were enacted for  which could add percent to the effective tax rate

a year to year comparison of net sales by region follows for the year ended dollars in thousands december  december  increase percent change north america europe latin america asia   nm total surfactants segment net sales for north american operations increased five percent due to a three percent increase in average selling prices  the effects of foreign currency translation and a small increase in sales volume less than one percent  which accounted for million  million and million  respectively  of the net sales change 
the higher average selling prices reflected higher raw material costs 
the cost of raw materials  which fell significantly during the economic recession of  moved higher throughout sales volume  which was essentially unchanged between years  reflected fourth quarter sales volume that was nine percent below the sales volume reported in the fourth quarter of the quarter over quarter decline was primarily attributable to weaker demand for the company s consumer products ie  laundry  cleaning and personal care products due to weaker retail demand and customers year end inventory adjustments 
the foreign currency translation effect resulted from the strengthening of the canadian dollar against the us dollar 
net sales for european operations increased percent due to a percent increase in average selling prices and a three percent increase in sales volume  which accounted for million and million  respectively  of the net sales change 
higher raw material costs caused the increase in average selling prices 
the effects of foreign currency  which reflected a weakening of european euro against the us dollar  reduced the net sales change by million 

table of contents net sales for latin american operations were up percent between years due to the effects of foreign currency translation and a five percent increase in sales volume  which accounted for million and million  respectively  of the net sales change 
a two percent decline in average selling prices reduced the net sales change by million 
the favorable currency translation effect resulted from the strengthening of the currencies for all three latin american locations against the us dollar 
new business at the region s brazil subsidiary was a major contributor to the year over year sales volume growth 
increased fabric softener sales also contributed 
the million of net sales for asia operations reflected sales by the company s philippine subsidiary for the period after the company acquired controlling interest in july surfactants operating income for declined million  or six percent  from operating income for gross profit declined million  or three percent 
the decline was primarily attributable to lower margins in europe  coupled with higher costs in north america brought about by a labor dispute 
year to year comparisons of gross profit by region and total segment operating expenses and operating income follow dollars in thousands for the year ended december  december  increase decrease percent change gross profit north america europe latin america asia   nm total surfactants segment operating expenses operating income gross profit for north american operations declined one percent due primarily to costs related to a lockout of hourly workers at the company s millsdale illinois manufacturing site related to a labor agreement dispute 
the previously noted decrease in fourth quarter sales volume also contributed to the decline 
the effect of foreign currency translation reduced the unfavorable year over year gross profit change by million 
gross profit for european operations declined percent as a result of the negative impact of higher raw material costs  which more than offset the effect of the three percent sales growth 
selling price have been increased  but have not kept pace with the rising costs of materials 
the effect of foreign currency translation added million to the year over year gross profit decline 
gross profit for latin american operations was up seven percent due to the favorable effects of foreign currency translation  which accounted for million of the year to year gross profit change 
the remainder of the change ie a million decline in gross profit was attributable to higher raw material costs and manufacturing expenses 
the higher manufacturing expenses related to a maintenance turnaround at the brazil plant 

table of contents the million of gross profit for asia operations reflected profits earned by the company s philippine subsidiary for the period after the company acquired controlling interest in july operating expenses for the surfactants segment were up million  or one percent  year over year 
the increase primarily consisted of million of higher research and development expenses partially offset by a million decline in marketing expenses 
the rise in research and development expenses included increases of million and million for north american and european operations  respectively 
the higher research and development expenses for north american operations reflected the company s continued commitment to drive commercial success of its innovation projects  which resulted in higher salaries and travel expenses 
most of the increase in research and development expense for european operations was due to expenses related to registering the company s products under europe s reach regulation 
the lower marketing expenses resulted from a decline in bad debt expenses in north america million and europe million 
the reduction in bad debt expenses was attributable to a decline in provisions for identified high risk accounts 
partially offsetting the decline in bad debt expense were higher north america operation expenses for salaries  travel and consulting expenses reflecting increased resources to support the company s asian growth initiatives 
polymers polymers net sales for increased million  or percent  over net sales for higher average selling prices and a percent increase in sales volume accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase in net sales 
the effects of foreign currency translation reduced the year over year change in net sales by million 
a year to year comparison of net sales by region is displayed below for the year ended dollars in thousands december  december  increase percent change north america europe asia and other total polymers segment net sales for north american operations grew percent due to a percent increase in average selling prices and an eight percent increase in sales volume  which accounted for million and million  respectively  of the increase in net sales 
higher raw material costs led to the increase in average selling prices 
sales volume for polyols and phthalic anhydride increased percent and two percent  respectively  which reflected improved economic conditions in the industries to which the polymer segment sells as well as new business for polyols 

table of contents net sales for european operations increased percent due to a percent increase in sales volume and a percent increase in average selling prices  which accounted for million and million  respectively  of the net sales increase 
new business and improved demand for polyol used in rigid insulation foam led to the growth in sales volume 
the region s recently acquired poland facility was an insignificant contributor to the year s sales results 
the average selling price increase was primarily attributable to higher raw material costs 
the effects of foreign currency translation reduced the year to year net sales change by million  which reflected the weakening of the european euro against the us dollar 
asia and other operations net sales were up percent year over year due largely to a percent increase in sales volume 
the growth in sales volume was primarily due to new business for the company s china subsidiary 
an improved economy also contributed 
polymers operating income for increased million  or nine percent  from operating income for gross profit grew million  or seven percent  due primarily to improvement in north america 
operating expenses increased million  or four percent  year over year 
below are year to year comparisons of gross profit by region and total segment operating expenses and operating income dollars in thousands for the year ended december  december  increase decrease percent change gross profit north america europe asia and other total polymers segment operating expenses operating income gross profit for north american operations increased percent due largely to the eight percent improvement in sales volume and better profit margins for the region s phthalic anhydride product line 
phthalic anhydride margins were detrimentally affected in by lower than usual production volumes and high priced material in inventory that was accumulated near the end of and carried over into prior to the significant recession driven decline in commodity costs 
partially offsetting the effects of improved phthalic anhydride profitability was the negative impact that rising raw material costs have had on profit margins for polyol products 
selling prices for polyols were increased during  but did not keep pace with raw material costs that increased on average by about percent 
european operations gross profit declined percent despite the percent increase in sales volume 
the negative effects of rising raw material costs and the outsourcing of product from the segment s north american operations due to capacity constraints more than offset the positive impact of the growth in sales volume 
as previously noted  selling price increases were made  but did not keep pace with increases in raw material costs 
the project to expand capacity at the region s germany location is scheduled to be completed early in the second quarter of the addition of the poland subsidiary to the region had little effect on year over year results 

table of contents asia and other operations gross profit increased four percent due to increased sales volume 
the million increase in operating expenses was due largely to higher expenses for north american million and european operations million  partially offset by the effects of foreign currency translation million 
increased marketing expenses  due to higher salary million and travel related million expenses  caused the north american expense increase 
the addition of the poland subsidiary s operating expenses led to the increase in european operations expenses 
specialty products net sales for were million  or one percent  lower than net sales for lower sales volume led to the decline 
sales volume declined two percent  which was primarily driven by lower sales of products used in food and flavoring applications 
operating income was up million  or percent  year over year due to lower raw material costs and increased sales of higher margin products 
corporate expenses corporate expenses  which include operating expenses that are not allocated to the reportable segments  declined million  or percent  to million in from million in year over year decreases of million for environmental remediation expense and for deferred compensation expense accounted for most of the corporate expense reduction 
the million decline in environmental remediation expense resulted primarily from the reduction of the estimated remediation liabilities for two sites 
new information related to the company s clean up costs at the two sites led to the liability reductions 
deferred compensation expense was million in compared to million in the decline in deferred compensation expense was principally attributable to changes in the values of company common stock to which a large portion of the deferred compensation obligation is tied the accounting for the deferred compensation plan results in income when the values of company common stock or mutual funds held in the plan fall and expense when values rise

the increase in deferred compensation expense is discussed in detail in the corporate expenses section of this md a 
improved operating results caused the rise in incentive based compensation  which includes stock based pay  bonuses and profit sharing 
the decline in 
table of contents transition pension expense was principally attributable to the acceleration of a portion of discretionary company contributions established to compensate certain employees for benefits lost when the company froze its defined benefit plans in no such accelerated benefits were paid in 
legal environmental expenses were up mainly due to increases in estimated environmental remediation reserve requirements for existing sites 
interest expense for was million  or percent  less than interest expense for the decline was caused by lower average debt levels  resulting from a decrease in working capital requirements brought on by lower raw material costs

certain of these matters are discussed in item  legal proceedings  in this form k and in other filings of the company with the securities and exchange commission  which are available upon request from the company

critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the accounting policies the company believes are the most important to aid in understanding its financial results 
deferred compensation the company sponsors deferred compensation plans that allow management employees to defer receipt of their bonuses and outside directors to defer receipt of their director fees until retirement  departure from the company or as elected by the participant 
the company funds its obligations associated with these plans by purchasing investment assets that match the investment choices made by the plan participants 
the investment options include company common stock and a limited selection of mutual funds 
the company maintains sufficient shares of treasury stock to cover the equivalent number of shares resulting from participants electing the company common stock option 
as a result  the company must periodically purchase its common shares on the open market 
the plans allow for the deferred compensation to grow or decline based on the results of the investment options chosen by the participants 
some plan distributions may be made in cash or company common stock at the election of the participant 
certain plan distributions can only be made in company common stock 
upon 
table of contents retirement or departure from the company  participants receive cash amounts equivalent to the payment date value of the investment choices they have made or company common stock shares equal to the number of share equivalents held in their account 
for deferred compensation obligations that may be settled in cash  appreciation in the value of company common stock or the mutual fund options under the plan results in additional compensation expense to the company 
conversely  declines in the value of company stock or the mutual funds result in a reduction of compensation expense since such declines reduce the cash obligation of the company as of the date of the financial statements 
these market price movements may result in significant period to period fluctuations in the company s income 
because the obligations that must be settled only in company common stock are treated as equity instruments  fluctuations in the market price of the underlying company stock do not affect earnings 
at december   the company s deferred compensation liability was million  of which approximately percent represented deferred compensation tied to the performance of the company s common stock  the remainder was tied to the mutual fund investment choices 
a increase in the market price of the company s common stock will result in approximately million of additional compensation expense 
a reduction in the market price of the common stock will reduce compensation expense by a like amount 
the expense or income associated with the mutual fund component will generally fluctuate in line with the overall percentage increase or decrease of the us stock markets 
the mutual fund assets are recorded on the company s balance sheet at cost when acquired and adjusted to their market values at the end of each reporting period 
since  when the company elected the fair value option provided by generally accepted accounting principles for the mutual fund investment assets related to its deferred compensation plans  market value changes for the mutual fund investment assets are recorded in the income statement in the same periods that the offsetting changes in the deferred compensation liabilities are recorded 
prior to  value changes for the mutual fund investments were recorded as direct adjustments to shareholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the accounting treatment for the portions of the deferred compensation liabilities that are tied to the company s common stock values was not affected by the fair value election 
dividends  capital gains distributed by the mutual funds  unrealized gains and losses and realized gains and losses from sales of mutual fund shares  are recognized as investment income loss in the other  net line of the consolidated statements of income 
environmental liabilities it is the company s accounting policy to record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within a range of possible costs is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
estimates for environmental liabilities are subject to significant fluctuations as new facts emerge related to the various sites where the company is exposed to liability for the remediation of environmental contamination 
see the environmental and legal matters section of this md a for discussion of the company s reserves and range of loss estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
for arrangements where the company consigns product to a customer location  revenue is recognized when the customer uses the inventory 
the company records shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
volume discounts due customers are estimated and recorded in the same period as the sales to which the discounts relate and reported as reductions of revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements  included in part ii  item  for information on recent accounting pronouncements  which affect the company 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk because the company operates globally  its cash flows and operating results are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company manufactures and sells products in many foreign locations and  therefore  believes its currency exchange risk is well diversified 
except as noted below  substantially all the company s foreign subsidiaries financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
gains and losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are recorded in income 
the company uses forward contracts to mitigate the exposure of certain foreign currency transactions and balances to fluctuating exchange rates 
at december   the company had one forward contract to sell million on behalf of its canadian subsidiary  one contract to purchase million on behalf of its uk subsidiary  and contracts to buy million and million on behalf of its french and german subsidiaries  respectively 
periodically  the company and its subsidiaries issue us dollar and euro denominated trade receivables or loans to each other 
gains and losses on these transactions are included in income 
foreign currency exposures for the company s canadian and european subsidiaries are essentially all covered by forward contracts as noted above 
as of december   the company had net receivables of million due from its brazilian subsidiary 
hypothetical fluctuations of percent in the exchange rate of the brazilian real would result in a gain or loss of million 
interest rates the company s debt was made up of fixed rate and variable rate borrowings totaling million and million  respectively  as of december  for  it is projected that interest on short term variable rate borrowings will total approximately million 
a hypothetical percent average change to short term interest rates would result in a million increase or decrease to interest expense for the fair value of the company s long term fixed rate debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million as of december   which was approximately million above the carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase to the fair value that would result from a hypothetical percent decrease in the company s weighted average long term borrowing rates at december   or million 
the company s long term debt also includes a million unsecured bank term loan that carries a contractual interest rate of libor plus basis points 
the current market spread over libor for this type of loan would be approximately basis points 
as of december   the fair value of this term loan was approximately million less than the carrying value 
a hypothetical percent decrease in the market borrowing rate would increase the fair value of this term loan by million 

table of contents commodity price risk certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products are subject to price volatility caused by weather  petroleum prices  general economic demand and other unpredictable factors 
increased raw material costs are recovered from customers as quickly as the marketplace allows  however  certain customers have arrangements that allow for price changes only on a quarterly basis  and competitive pressures sometimes prevent the recovery of cost increases from customers  particularly in periods where there is excess industry capacity 
as a result  for some product lines or market segments it may take time to recover raw material price increases 
periodically  firm purchase commitments are entered into which fix the price of a specific commodity that will be delivered at a future time 
forward contracts are used to aid in managing the company s natural gas and electric costs 
at december   the company had open forward contracts for the purchase of million dekatherms of natural gas at a cost of million 
because the company has agreed to fixed prices for the noted quantity of natural gas  a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of natural gas would cause the company s actual natural gas cost to be million higher or lower than the market price 
also at december   the company had contracts to purchase approximately  megawatt hours of electricity at a cost of million 
because the company has agreed to fixed prices for the noted quantity of electricity  a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of electricity would cause the company s actual electric cost to be million higher or lower than the market price
