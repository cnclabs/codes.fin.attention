overview the company designs  develops and markets an array of footwear  apparel and accessories for athletic  high performance sports and fitness activities and casual wear under the k swiss brand 
since july and july  the company also designs  develops and markets footwear for adventurers for all terrains under the palladium brand and apparel for mixed martial arts under the form athletics brand  respectively 
sales of the palladium brand and form athletics brand were approximately and  respectively  of total sales in the categories of footwear we sell are explained in more detail in part i  item  under the subheading  products 
we market our products through company employed sales managers and independent regional sales representatives primarily to a limited number of specialty athletic footwear stores  pro shops  sporting good stores and department stores and also through a number of foreign distributors 
we also sell our products through our website and retail locations  which are becoming increasingly important sales channels to us particularly in light of our limited distribution 
due to the recent global economic crisis  the retail environment has been particularly challenging during the last few years 
while economic conditions began to show signs of improvement beginning in the second half of  the recovery has proceeded at a sluggish rate and the retail environment has remained weak 
as a result  business conditions may remain difficult for the foreseeable future 
these conditions combined with the weak demand for the company s product during the past few years could put additional pressure on the company s ability to maintain margins 
in  approximately of our k swiss brand footwear products were manufactured in china  approximately in thailand  approximately in vietnam and approximately in taiwan 
during  our contract manufacturer in thailand  one of only three manufacturers utilized by us at that time in our global supply chain  ceased operations 
as a result  we experienced production delays as we attempted to secure permanent production capacity in other facilities and other regions in asia 
although we have no long term manufacturing agreements  we believe that our current relationships with our producers are satisfactory and that we have the ability to develop alternative sources for our footwear 
our operations could  however  be materially and adversely affected if a substantial delay occurred in locating and obtaining alternative producers 
because we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to our customer  our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting 
table of contents shipment of products 
our total revenues decreased in from  due to a decrease in the volume of footwear sold  offset by an increase in the average underlying wholesale price per pair 
our overall gross profit margins  as a percentage of revenues  were and in and  respectively 
the increase in our gross profit margin is mainly due to product mix changes  including a lower percentage of sales of close out product which has a lower gross profit margin 
our overall selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  in from  in as a result of increases in advertising expenses  offset by decreases in data processing expenses and compensation expenses 
in addition  an impairment charge of  on goodwill and intangible assets related to the trademarks of the palladium brand was recognized in other expense for consists of the recognition of  which represents the net present value of the estimated contingent purchase price cpp for palladium

in  we recognized a tax valuation allowance of  against our us and certain international deferred tax assets 
at december   our total futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were  an increase of from the comparable period of the prior year

in  we experienced net cash used in operating activities from continuing operations of  net cash used in investing activities of  due mainly to the purchase of investments available for sale and restricted investments available for sale  offset by proceeds from the sale or maturity of investments available for sale and net cash used in financing activities of  mainly as a result of net borrowings on bank lines of credit 
we anticipate future cash needs for principal repayments required pursuant to borrowings under our lines of credit and  depending on future operating results  additional funds may be required for operating activities 
at december  and  we had debt outstanding of  and  in each case attributable to outstanding borrowings by palladium under its lines of credit facilities and term loans  excluding outstanding letters of credit of  and  at december  and  respectively 
our working capital decreased  to  at december  from  at december   mainly due to decreases in cash and cash equivalents  income taxes receivable  accounts receivable and current deferred income taxes and increases in trade accounts payable  offset by increases in investments available for sale  inventory and prepaid expenses and other current assets and decreases in bank lines of credit and current portion of long term debt 

table of contents critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note a to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to the carrying value of inventories  realizability of outstanding accounts receivable  goodwill and intangible assets  sales returns and allowances  and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
in the past  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
however  results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we record revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment 
in some instances  we ship product directly from our supplier to the customer 
in these cases  we recognize revenue when the product is delivered to the customer according to the terms of the order 
our revenues may fluctuate in cases when our customers delay accepting shipment of product for periods up to several weeks 
as part of our revenue recognition policy  we record estimated sales returns and allowances as reductions to revenues 
we base our estimates on historical rates of returns and allowances and specific identification of outstanding returns not yet received from customers 
however  actual returns and allowances in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from our estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and allowances were significantly greater or lower than the reserves we had established  we would record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we made such determination 
accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate potential losses based on our knowledge of the financial condition of certain customers and historical level of credit losses  as well as an assessment of the overall retail conditions 
historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
furthermore  we provide for estimated losses resulting from differences that arise from the gross carrying value of our receivables and the amounts which customers estimate are owed to us 
the settlement or resolution of these differences could result in future changes to these estimates 
our allowance for bad debts as a percentage of accounts receivable has remained relatively constant over the past three years despite the weak economy due to our increased scrutiny of customer relationships 

table of contents inventory reserves we also make ongoing estimates relating to the market value of inventories  based upon our assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the market value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a reserve equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated market value 
this reserve is recorded as a charge to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated market value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our reserve in the period in which we made such a determination and record the additional charge to cost of sales 
inventory reserve as a percentage of inventory decreased in and from as a result of significant reserves being established in and substantial liquidation of impaired inventory in income taxes we account for income taxes under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we evaluate uncertain tax positions and recognize the benefit exposure of those positions if they meet the more likely than not threshold 
any tax position recognized is an adjustment to the effective tax rate 
also  at any point in time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with tax authorities may affect tax positions taken 
additionally  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the geographic mix or level of earnings 
we have not recorded united states income tax expense on earnings of selected foreign subsidiary companies as these are intended to be permanently invested  thus reducing our overall income tax expense 
the amount of earnings designated as permanently invested is based upon our expectations of the future cash needs of our subsidiaries 
income tax considerations are also a factor in determining the amount of earnings to be permanently invested 
because the declaration involves our future plans and expectations of future events  the possibility exists that amounts declared as permanently invested may ultimately be repatriated 
this would result in additional income tax expense in the year we determine that amounts were no longer permanently invested 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full calendar year by estimating pre tax income  excluding significant or infrequently occurring items  and tax expense for the remaining quarterly periods of the year 
the estimated annual effective tax rate is then applied to year to date pre tax income to determine the estimated year to date and quarterly tax expense 
the income tax effects of infrequent or unusual items are recognized in the quarterly period in which they occur 
as the year progresses  we continually refine our estimate based upon actual events and earnings 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to our expected annual effective tax rate 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date income tax provision equals the estimated annual rate 
our effective tax rate fluctuates mainly due to our geographic mix of sales and earnings 
in addition  starting january   provision has not been made for united states income taxes on earnings of selected international subsidiary companies as these are intended to be permanently invested 
we evaluate the future realization of our deferred tax assets quarterly 
we review each material tax jurisdiction for which a deferred tax asset has been recorded 
our analysis includes a review of past results  future income  the tax life of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given 
table of contents to evidence that can be objectively verified 
all evidence is evaluated in forming a conclusion whether a valuation allowance  if any  needs to be recorded 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
we account for the uncertainty in income tax positions and use a minimum recognition threshold that a tax position must meet before recognition in the financial statements 
the evaluation of a tax position is a two step process 
the first step is a recognition process to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  it is presumed that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit expense to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit expense that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
any tax position recognized would be an adjustment to the effective tax rate 
we recognize interest expense and penalties on income tax liabilities in income tax expense on our consolidated statement of earnings loss 
we recognize our uncertain tax positions in either accrued income taxes  if determined to be short term  or other liabilities if determined to be long term  on our consolidated balance sheet 
goodwill and intangible assets indefinite lived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually  and more often when events indicate that an impairment exists 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment reviews include among other factors  significant changes in business climate  operating results  planned investments  or an expectation that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the test for impairment involves the use of estimates relating to the fair values of business operations with which the goodwill is associated and the fair values of intangible assets with indefinite lives 
we review goodwill for impairment in a two step process 
the first step is to determine whether there is potential impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value which includes goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying value  then goodwill is not considered impaired  however  if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  then step two is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating fair value to all assets and liabilities 
the excess  if any  is the implied fair value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of goodwill  then impairment is recognized 
we review intangible assets related to trademarks for impairment  by determining fair value using a relief from royalty payments methodology 
this approach involves two steps i estimating reasonable royalty rates for each trademark and ii applying these royalty rates to a net sales stream and discounting the resulting cash flows to determine fair value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value then impairment is recognized 
determining the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets is highly subjective and requires the use of estimates and assumptions 
we use estimates including estimated future revenues  royalty rates and discount rates  among other factors 
we also consider the following factors the asset s ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  
table of contents changes in consumer demand or acceptance of our brands and products  and other considerations that could affect fair value or otherwise indicate potential impairment 
in addition  facts and circumstances could change  including further deterioration of general economic conditions  customers reducing orders in response to such conditions and increased competition 
these and or other factors could result in changes to the calculation of the fair value which could result in future impairment of the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets 
changes in any one or more of these estimates and assumptions could produce different financial results 
other contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liability claims  trademark rights and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities resulting from claims against us  including related legal costs  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgment about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
currently  we do not believe that any of our pending legal proceedings or claims will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability for such claims  we would record additional charges during the period in which the actual loss or change in estimate occurred 
purchase of form athletics on july   we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement purchase agreement with form athletics  llc form athletics and its members to purchase form athletics for  in cash 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we are obligated to pay additional cash consideration to certain members of form athletics in an amount equal to form athletics ebitda for the twelve months ended december  form cpp 
the purchase price of  and the net present value of the initial estimate of the form cpp was capitalized 
the fair value of the form cpp will be determined each quarter based on the net present value of the current quarter s projection of form athletics ebitda for the twelve months ended december  any subsequent changes to the form cpp will be recognized as interest income or interest expense during the applicable quarter 
form athletics was established in january and designs  develops and distributes apparel for mixed martial arts under the form athletics brand worldwide 
the purchase of form athletics was part of an overall strategy to enter the action sports market 

table of contents the acquisition of form athletics was recorded as a purchase acquisition and the form cpp liability was recognized and accordingly  the results of operations of the acquired business are included in the company s consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
a trademark asset totaling  and goodwill of  have been recognized for the amount of the excess purchase price paid over fair market value of the net assets acquired 
the amount of goodwill that is deductible for tax purposes is  and will be amortized over years

international revenues  as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to in from in k swiss brand revenues decreased to  in from  in this decrease was the result of a decrease in the volume of footwear sold  offset by an increase in the average underlying wholesale price per pair 
the volume of footwear sold decreased to  pair in from  pair in the average wholesale price per pair was in and in  an increase of  which resulted from the product mix of sales  including a higher percentage of performance product sold in  which generally sell at a higher price than lifestyle product  and a lower percentage of sales of closeout product in palladium brand revenues increased to  in of which were derived from domestic sales compared to  in of which were derived from domestic sales 
the increase in palladium sales in was due to the increase in worldwide sales in regions other than france 
we began marketing and selling palladium product in these regions beginning in the second half of the volume of footwear sold increased to  pair in from  pair in  due to an increase in sales in regions other than france  as discussed above 
the average underlying wholesale price per pair was in and in  a decrease of  resulting from closeout product in france selling at lower prices in compared to form athletics brand revenues were  in of which were derived from domestic sales  representing approximately five months of activity 
we believe the athletic and casual footwear industry experiences seasonal fluctuations  due to increased sales during certain selling seasons  including easter  back to school and the year end holiday seasons 
we present full line offerings for the easter season for delivery during the first and second quarters and back to school season for delivery during the third quarter  but only limited offerings for the year end holiday season 
at december   domestic and international futures orders with start ship dates from january through june were approximately  and  respectively  higher and lower  respectively  than such orders were at december  for start ship dates of the comparable period of the prior year 
these orders are not necessarily indicative of revenues for subsequent periods because the mix of future and at once orders can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year and the rate of customer order cancellations can also vary from quarter to quarter and year to year 
overall gross profit margin  as a percentage of revenues  was in  an increase from in this increase was largely the result of the lower level of sales of closeout product in compared to k swiss brand gross profit margin  as a percentage of revenues  was in  an increase from in this increase was the result of the lower level of sales of closeout product in compared to palladium brand gross profit margin  as a percentage of revenues  was in  a decrease from in this decrease in was a result of lower gross profit margins earned in on closeout product in france 
our gross margins may not be comparable to some of our competitors as we recognize warehousing costs within selling  general and administrative expenses 
these warehousing costs were  and  for and  respectively 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses overall selling  general and administrative expenses increased to  of revenues in from  of revenues in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during was the result of increases in advertising expenses  offset by decreases in data processing expenses and compensation expenses 
advertising expenses increased as a result of strategic efforts to drive revenue in both domestic and international markets 
data processing costs decreased as a result of the decreases in on going maintenance expense for our sap computer software system due to the completion of the sap implementation in certain international regions in the fourth quarter of compensation expenses  which include commissions  bonus incentive related expenses and employee recruiting and relocation expenses  decreased mainly as a result of decreases in average headcount from and stock option compensation expenses 
corporate expenses of  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively  are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the decrease in corporate expenses for was a result of decreases in data processing expenses and compensation expenses  as discussed above 
impairment on intangibles and goodwill an impairment charge of  on the intangible assets related to the trademarks of the palladium brand was recognized for as a result of the company s annual reassessment of impairment using the relief from royalty payment methodology  which uses current market discount rates and royalty rates 
goodwill impairment of  was also recognized on the palladium brand for as part of its annual reassessment of impairment  the company determined the fair value of the reporting unit using both an income approach ie  discounted cash flow methodology and a market approach ie  guideline public company and guideline transactions methodologies 
as a result of the assessment  primarily based on deteriorating economic market conditions in  it was determined that goodwill was impaired 
these impairment charges are included as corporate expenses for other income  interest and taxes other expense for consists of the recognition of  which represents the net present value of the estimated cpp for palladium  as discussed below 
other expense for includes a loss upon the purchase of the remaining equity interest of palladium of  offset by a gain on the sale of certain assets of the royal elastics brand of  on may   we entered into amendment no

table of contents on june   we purchased the remaining equity interest in palladium for  or  and recognized a loss of  on the purchase 
the loss was calculated as the difference between the purchase price and the recorded mandatorily redeemable minority interest mrmi 
we acquired the initial equity interest in palladium on july  and the acquisition of palladium was recorded as a purchase acquisition without reflecting any minority interest but recognizing the mrmi liability

on april   we sold certain royal elastics assets  consisting of its inventory located in taiwan and its intangible trademarks  with an approximate net book value of  to royal elastics holdings ltd 
reh  a third party  in an arm s length transaction for  in respect to this sale  we received a  promissory note from reh and reh agreed to pay us the remaining  in cash by april  as of december   however  we only received approximately  in cash 
the difference between what we expected to receive and what had been received by april  was added to the principal amount of the promissory note balance  such that as of december   we hold a promissory note in the principal amount of approximately  from reh 
interest on the promissory note is payable quarterly at an interest rate of wall street journal prime plus

net interest income was  of revenues and  of revenues for and  respectively 
the decrease in net interest income for the was a result of lower average balances in cash and investments available for sale as well as lower interest rates  offset by a decrease in the amount recognized for the change in the fair value of the cpp in or mrmi in and a decrease in interest expense on palladium debt 
our income tax expense was  for and our income tax benefit was  for we did not recognize income tax benefit of options exercised during as a result of our net loss for the year 
the  income tax benefit of options exercised during was credited to additional paid in capital and therefore did not impact the effective tax rate 
we evaluate our deferred tax assets  including net operating losses and tax credits  to determine if a valuation allowance is required 
we assess whether a valuation allowance should be established based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
a cumulative loss in recent years is significant negative evidence in considering whether deferred tax assets are realizable 
during the second quarter  we moved into a three year pre tax cumulative loss but had sufficient objectively verifiable evidence to demonstrate that our us deferred tax assets would be realized  such as strong earnings history  no evidence of tax losses expiring unused and the end of our aggressive advertising campaign during during the third quarter of  we continued to have the significant weight of the three year pre tax cumulative loss to overcome 
in addition to other significant positive evidence considered in the prior quarter  we decided during the third quarter of to continue with our aggressive advertising campaign into as such  we could no longer rely on a decrease in advertising expenses during to support future profitability sufficient enough to realize our u 
s deferred tax assets in the near future 
therefore  in  we recorded a valuation allowance of  against our deferred tax assets 

table of contents at december  we had a net deferred tax asset after valuation allowance of  the ultimate realization of this net deferred tax asset is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income outside of the us during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
changes in existing tax laws could also affect actual tax results and the valuation of deferred tax assets over time 
the deferred tax assets for which valuation allowances were not established relate to foreign jurisdictions where we expect to realize these assets 
the accounting for deferred taxes is based upon an estimate of future operating results 
differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these future tax consequences could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
at december  uncertain tax positions and the related interest were  and  respectively  all of which would affect the income tax rate if reversed

this issue has been sent to the irs appeal s office for further consideration

the extent to which forward foreign exchange contracts are used is modified periodically in response to management s estimate of market conditions and the terms and length of specific sales contracts 
we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts in order to reduce the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and not to engage in currency speculation
