item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes  included in item of this report 
unless otherwise specified  all dollar amounts are us dollars 
overview we are an in vitro diagnostic company that has developed a proprietary tear testing platform  the tearlab osmolarity system 
the tearlab test measures tear film osmolarity for diagnosis of dry eye disease  or ded 
tear osmolarity is a quantitative and highly specific biomarker that has been shown to correlate with ded 
the tearlab test enables the rapid measurement of tear osmolarity in a doctor office 
we refer to the results of our tearlab testing platform as our point of care business division in the discussion of our operating results below 
commercializing our point of care tear testing platform is now the focus of our business 
in october  the tearlab osmolarity system received ce mark approval  clearing the way for sales in the european union and all countries recognizing the ce mark 
in connection with the ce mark clearance  we have entered into multi year agreements with numerous distributors for distribution of the tearlab osmolarity system 
currently  we have signed distribution agreements in each of the following countries spain  portugal  germany  france  turkey  ukraine  bulgaria  belgium  netherlands  switzerland  finland  sweden  south korea  australia  russia  hungary  greece  canada  slovakia  argentina  the czech republic and the united kingdom and a sales representation agreement in japan 
on may   we announced that we received k clearance from the us food and drug administration  fda 
the k clearance allows us to market the tearlab osmolarity system to those reference and physician operated laboratories with clia certifications allowing them to perform moderate and high complexity tests 
considering that most of our target customers currently are eye care practitioners without such certifications  we intend to seek a clia waiver from the fda for the tearlab osmolarity system as well as assisting our customers in obtaining their moderate complexity clia certification or providing them with support from certified professionals 
a clia waiver would greatly reduce the regulatory compliance for our future customers 
until we receive the clia waiver certification  doctors using the tearlab osmolarity system must be certified under themoderate complexity clia certification 
on march   the company announced that it was in receipt of a communication from the us food and drug administration fda indicating that the data submitted by the company was not sufficient to gain approval of its clia waiver categorization application for the tearlab osmolarity system 
the company is reviewing the comments made by the fda and developing the necessary responses or strategies required to continue to pursue the clia waiver 
the company will also continue to pursue it strategy to assist its customers in obtaining moderate complexity clia certificates 
on december  we announced that health canada issued a medical device license for the tearlab osmolarity system 
the health canada license allowed us to immediately begin marketing the system in canada 
on august   we entered into an agreement with a distributor  science with vision  for exclusive distribution of the tearlab osmolarity system in canada 
we began selling products through the canadian distributor in 
table of contents on october  we announced that a unique new current procedural terminology cpt code that will apply to the tearlab osmolarity test has now been be published by the american medical association ama 
the new code will become effective january  the new cpt code for the tearlab osmolarity test is  microfluidic analysis utilizing an integrated collection and analysis device  tear osmolarity for microfluidic tear osmolarity of both eyes  report twice 
this code falls under the chemistry sub section of the pathology and laboratory section of the cpt codebook and will be listed under the clinical laboratory fee schedule by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms 
reimbursement by cms has been set at per eye and will only be available for offices that have a moderate complex clia certificate until tearlab receives a clia waiver categorization from the fda 
under the clinical laboratory fee schedule listed by cms the reimbursement rate was reduced to and was applicable to a majority of states in the us our success is highly dependent on our ability to increase sales of our testing platform in european and other countries recognizing the ce mark  in canada where we have a medical device license and on our receipt of a clia waiver which will enable us to begin full commercialization efforts in the united states 
meeting these objectives requires that we have sufficient capital to fund our operations 
our working capital of  as of december  is insufficient to fund our planned operations and our ability to generate increased revenues is uncertain 
if our revenues do not increase sufficiently to meet operational needs we would be required to raise additional capital to fund our operations 
we have sufficient cash to fund our operations at current levels through approximately july if our convertible note holders do not convert their convertible notes and accrued interest to common shares of the company in july and only until december if our convertible note holders do convert their convertible notes and accrued interest to common shares of the company in july we continue to actively evaluate and pursue various finacing possibilities at this time 
recent developments on january  the company announced that it and cola  a private  non profit clinical laboratory education  consultation and accreditation organization  had partnered to help make the tearlab osmolarity system available in the us at the point of care 
as previously announced  the tearlab osmolarity test will be reimbursed by the cms  effective january  reimbursement will only be available  however  for offices that have a moderate complexity clia certificate until such time that tearlab receives a clia waiver categorization from the fda 
tearlab s customers are able to obtain their moderate complexity clia certification by working with cola who will assist them in filing the required documentation  using the cola on line cme program and completing the required regulatory process 
with the moderate complexity clia certification  our customers will be able to be reimbursed for performing the tearlab osmolarity test on their patients 
on march   the company announced that it had received communication from the fda indicating that the data submitted by the company did not meet the requirements to gain approval of its clia waiver categorization application for the tearlab osmolarity system 
the company is reviewing the comments made by the fda and developing the necessary responses or strategies required to continue to pursue the clia waiver

the tearlab osmolarity system consists of the following three components the tearlab disposable  which is a single use microfluidic labcard  the tearlab pen  which is a hand held device that interfaces with the tearlab disposable  and the tearlab reader  which is a small desktop unit that allows for the docking of the tearlab disposable and the tearlab pen and provides a quantitative reading for the operator 
we are working with our established distributors in europe and asia to increase sales 
the ability for re imbursement to be obtained in many of those countries where we have distributors will facilitate our ability to increase sales and stimulate the commercialization process 
we intend to expand our distribution network to include additional european  asian and latin american countries in the future 
the company is supporting these distributors in local clinical trials and in providing them with the required guidance to understand the relationship between ded and osmolarity and how to manage their patients with objective diagnostic data 
having received k approval from the fda in the united states  we have begun selling to customers in the united states who hold clia moderate and high complexity certificates and are actively supporting and assisting our customers to obtain their moderate complexity clia certificates or providing them with support from certified professionals 
we are seeking to obtain a clia waiver certificate which will allow us to sell our product to the approximately  eye care practitioners in the united states that are candidates to operate under a clia waiver certification 

table of contents having received a medical device license from health canada in december  we have been selling the tearlab osmolarity systems into canada via a distributor in and have established a co operative marketing agreement with amo canada to market our product and support the sale of amo drugs related to ded in canada 
we believe that it is important that eye care professionals in the united states develop a clinical understanding of the tearlab osmolarity system 
in december  we put in place a program to facilitate this education process in which we provide customers with a free test card s for every card purchased to allow them to utilize these free cards to better understand its effectiveness and how it can improve their business practices 
as a result  of this program  the average selling price per card decreased to reflect the free cards being provided 
during the years ended december   and the company recognized revenue from the sale of tearlab equipment of   and  respectively 
retina retina revenue  which ended in  consisted of revenue generated from the sale of components of the rheo system which consists of a rheofilter filter  a plasmaflo filter  and tubing which  together  comprise a disposable treatment set  and an octo nova pump 
during the year ended december   the company sold a total of treatment sets on consignment resulting in revenue of  in addition  the company sold octo nova pumps resulting in revenues of  in the year ended december  all pumps and disposable treatment sets had previously been fully reserved in the fourth quarter of when we suspended all rheo system related activities 
on november   we announced an indefinite suspension of the rheo system clinical development program for dry amd and are in the process of winding down all remaining rheo related clinical studies 
as a result  we did not generate any retina revenue for the years ended december  and and do not expect to generate revenue from rheo related products in the future 
cost of goods sold tearlab tearlab cost of goods sold includes costs of goods sold and royalty costs 
our cost of goods sold consists primarily of costs for the manufacture of the tearlab test  including the costs we incur for the purchase of component parts from our suppliers  applicable freight and shipping costs  fees related to warehousing and logistics inventory management

research and development expenditures specific to the tearlab product for the years ended december  and were  and  respectively 
the decrease of  was reflective of the maturing stage of tearlab technological development in that the development of the tearlab osmolarity system ended at the end of september and moved to a production or commercial focus 
this decrease was offset by a  increase in labor and development expenses for on going engineering support 
an additional decrease of  relates to the indefinite suspension of our rheo system clinical development program 
this was offset by an  increase in tearlab clinical trial expenses related to fda k and clia certification 
these achievements allowed the company to move forward with clinical trials to attain the ce mark in europe and k approval from the fda in the united states  in advance of commercialization but resulted in a reduced need for development activities

the company accounts for all of its outstanding warrants in accordance with the provisions of fasb asc topic derivatives and hedging 
the fasb guidance requires every derivative instrument within its scope including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts to be recorded on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at its fair value  with changes in the derivative fair value recognized in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
the estimated fair value was determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
based on us gaap guidance applicable to derivatives  the company determined that none of the outstanding warrants meet the criteria for classification as equity 
accordingly  the company classified its outstanding warrants as current liabilities at december   and in addition  asc topic requires us to record the outstanding derivatives at fair value at the end of each reporting period resulting in an adjustment to the recorded liability of the derivative  with any gain or loss recorded in earnings of the applicable reporting period 
we therefore estimated the aggregate fair value of outstanding warrants for the years ended december    and and determined them to be   and  respectively

however  as a result of market conditions  all of these investments had failed to settle on their respective settlement dates 
based on discussions with our advisors and the lack of liquidity for ars of this type  we concluded that the carrying value of these investments was higher than its fair value as of december  accordingly  these ars were recorded at their estimated fair value of  we considered this to be an other than temporary reduction in the value of these ars 
accordingly  the impairment associated with these ars of  was included as an impairment of investments in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  credit suisse purchased our outstanding ars for an aggregate amount of  as a result of the realization of the original principal amount of the ars  we recorded a gain of  in our consolidated statement of operations

the finance costs had been fully expensed at the time of the conversion of the bridge loans in october in  under the terms of certain bridge loans  the conversion price was set at per share  a discount to the per share paid by pipe investors 
accordingly  following fasb guidance  we recorded a beneficial conversion on the sale of common stock of  in october  which is equal to the number of shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the bridge loans multiplied by the difference between the estimated fair value of the common stock and the bridge loan conversion price per share 
the beneficial conversion resulted in a charge to the statement of operations and is included in additional paid in capital in the same amount

recovery of income taxes for the years ended december  in thousands change change recovery of income taxes for continuing operations pursuant to internal revenue code section and  the annual use of the net operating loss carryforwards could be limited by any greater than ownership change during any three year testing period 
as a result of any such ownership change  portions of the company s net operating loss carryforwards are subject to annual limitations 
the company believes an ownership change occurred in and the annual limitations on net operating loss carryforwards will materially impact the future utilization of such carryforwards and will expire unused 
accordingly  the company has removed the net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change from their deferred tax assets accompanied by a corresponding reduction of the valuation allowance 
the recovery of income taxes decreased by  in the year ended december  to from  in the year ended december  this decrease in the year ended december  arose because in the year ended december  tax losses benefitted were  while in the year ended december  tax losses were no longer benefitted as tax losses benefitted fully offset deferred tax liability balances 
in the year ended december   amortization of deferred tax liabilities of  was recorded as a recovery of income taxes while in  all amortization of deferred tax liabilities ie  was completely offset by the reversal of previously benefitted tax losses 
tax losses benefitted in prior years were reversed to ensure that cumulative tax losses benefitted did not exceed cumulative deferred tax liability balances 

table of contents the recovery of income taxes increased by  in the year ended december  to  from  in the year ended december  this increase in the year ended december  arose because in the year ended december   issuance of shares in association with the pipe  conversion of bridge loans and acquisition of the non controlling shareholding of tearlab research  inc  resulted in a change of control for tax purposes and a section restriction on the amount of tax losses prior to these transactions that can be recovered 
as a result of the section restrictions  a net reversal of benefits ie a tax expense of  occurred in the year ended december  there was no reversal of benefits reported in the year ended december  in the year ended december  tax losses benefitted decreased by  to  in the year ended december  from  in the year ended december  tax losses were no longer benefitted during the year ended december  once tax losses benefitted had fully offset deferred tax liabilities in the year 
in the year ended december   amortization of deferred tax liabilities increased by  as compared to the year ended december  to date  we have recognized income tax benefits in the aggregate amount of million net of any reversals associated with the recognition of the deferred tax asset from the availability of net operating losses in the united states which may be utilized to reduce taxes in future years 
the benefits associated with the balance of the net operating losses are subject to a full valuation allowance since it is not more likely than not that these losses can be utilized in future years 
recovery of income taxes for the years ended december  and also includes the amortization of the deferred tax liability of  and  respectively  which was recorded based on the a the difference between the fair value of intangible asset acquired upon the acquisition of a majority interest in tearlab research  inc on november  and its tax base 
this difference produces a deferred tax liability totaling  arising from intangible assets being amortized over a period of approximately years  the estimated useful life of the intangible asset  and b an additional deferred tax liability arose in totaling  which is related to the beneficial conversion feature associated with the notes payable and is being amortized over the two year life of the short term liabilities

table of contents financial condition management believes that we have sufficient cash to fund our operations at current levels through approximately july if our convertible note holders do not convert their convertible notes and accrued interest to common shares of the company in july and only until december if our convertible note holders do convert their convertible notes and accrued interest to common shares of the company in july our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary as a result of a number of factors 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the cost and results  and the rate of progress  of the clinical trials of the tearlab osmolarity system that will be required to support tearlab  inc application to obtain a clia waiver from the fda  tearlab  inc ability to obtain a clia waiver from the fda for the tearlab osmolarity system and the timing of such approval  if any  whether government and third party payers agree to reimburse the tearlab osmolarity system  whether eye care professionals engage in the process of obtaining their moderate complex clia certification  the costs and timing of building the infrastructure to market and sell the tearlab osmolarity system  the cost and results of continuing development of tearlab corp 
s tearlab osmolarity system  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
at the present time  our only product is the tearlab osmolarity system  and although we have received k approval from the fda it only allows limited commercialization of our product in the united states until we receive a clia waiver approval from the fda 
at this time  we do not know when we can expect to begin to generate significant revenues from the tearlab osmolarity system in the united states 
we will need additional capital in approximately july if our convertible note holders do not convert their convertible notes and accrued interest to common shares of the company in july and approximately december if our convertible note holders do convert their convertible notes and accrued interest to common shares of the company in july and our prospects for obtaining that capital are uncertain 
additional capital may not be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
in addition  future financings could result in significant dilution of existing stockholders 
however  unless we succeed in raising additional capital  we anticipate that we will be unable to continue our operations beyond approximately july if our convertible note holders do not convert their convertible notes and accrued interest to common shares of the company in july and approximately december if our convertible note holders do convert their convertible notes and accrued interest to common shares of the company in july

the exercise price of the warrants is per share 
the warrants are exercisable at any time on or after the sixth month anniversary of the closing date through and until the month anniversary of the closing of the offering 
ongoing sources and uses of cash we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from increased revenues  will be sufficient to sustain our operations until approximately july if our convertible note holders do not convert their convertible notes and accrued interest to common shares of the company in july and approximately december if our convertible note holders do convert their convertible notes and accrued interest to common shares of the company in july we continually evaluate various financing possibilities but we typically expect our primary sources of cash will be related to the collection of accounts receivable and  to a lesser degree  interest income on our cash and investment balances 
our accounts receivable collections will be impacted by our ability to grow our point of care revenue 
we expect our primary uses of cash will be to fund our operating expenses and pursuing and maintaining our patents and trademarks 
in addition  dependent on available funds  we expect to expend cash to improve production capability of the tearlab test  to further improve the performance of the tearlab test  and to pursue additional applications for the lab on a chip technology

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our intangible assets  uncollectible receivables  inventories  debt and equity instruments and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
because this can vary in each situation  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our audited consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
amounts received in excess of revenue recognizable are deferred 
subsequent to its launch in the fourth quarter of  the company s revenues have been derived from sales of the tearlab osmolarity system for ded which consists of hardware and related disposables 
the company s sales are currently to countries in north america  europe  and asia  and are generally transacted through distributors 
the company records revenue when all of its obligations are completed which is generally upon shipment of the company s products accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable consist primarily of trade receivables from customers and are generally unsecured and due within days 
the company evaluates the collectability of its accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
expected credit losses related to trade receivables are recorded as an allowance for doubtful accounts in the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and the allowance for doubtful accounts is charged to sales and marketing expense and accounts receivable are written off as uncollectible and deducted from the allowance after appropriate collection efforts have been exhausted 
the carrying value of accounts receivable approximates their fair value due to their short term nature 
to date  charges for bad debt expense have not been material 
inventory valuation inventory is recorded at the lower of cost based on first in  first out basis or market and consists of finished goods 
inventory is periodically reviewed for evidence of slow moving or obsolete items  and the estimated reserve is based on management reviews of inventories on hand  compared to estimated future usage and sales  reviewing product shelf life  and assumptions about the likelihood of obsolescence 
as of december   and  we had inventory reserves of   and  respectively 
during the years ended december   and  we recognized a provision for excess and obsolete inventory of   and  respectively  and wrote off  and  respectively 
valuation of intangible and other long lived assets 
we periodically assess the carrying value of intangible and other long lived assets  which requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the future cash flows of these assets 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances the asset ability to continue to generate income from operations and positive cash flow in future periods  loss of legal ownership or title to the asset  significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the asset s  and 
table of contents the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if the assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined by a combination of third party sources and discontinued cash flows 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the period that the assets will generate revenues or otherwise be used by us 
we also periodically review the lives assigned to our intangible assets to ensure that our initial estimates do not exceed any revised estimated periods from which we expect to realize cash flows from the technologies 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  the likelihood of a material change in our reported results would increase 
at december   the net book value of identifiable intangible assets that are subject to amortization totaled  and the net book value of fixed assets totaled  we determined that  as of december  and  there have been no significant events which may have affected the carrying value of tearlab technology 
however  our prior history of losses and losses incurred during the current fiscal year reflects a potential indication of impairment  thus requiring management to assess whether tearlab research  inc technology was impaired as of december  and based on management estimates of forecasted undiscounted cash flows as of december  and  we concluded that there was no indication of an impairment of the tearlab technology in either fiscal period 
stock based compensation we use the fair value method to account for share based payments in accordance with the authoritative guidance for stock compensation 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes merton option pricing model  or black scholes model  that uses assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock 
the expected term of options granted is based on analyses of historical employee termination rates and option exercises 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant 
since we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  we estimated the dividend yield to be 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate pre vesting forfeitures based on our historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for determination of fair value in future periods  the share based compensation expense that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with authoritative guidance on stock compensation using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 

table of contents as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
income taxes we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the completion of the reorganization transactions on october  makes it more likely than not that we incurred a change of control for purposes of section for us income taxes 
see note income taxes in the notes to the financial statements 
rules under section of the us internal revenue code substantially reduce our ability to utilize prior tax losses 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect to recover or settle those temporary differences 
we recognize the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved 
for further explanation of our provision for income taxes  see note  income taxes

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk currency fluctuations and exchange risk all of our sales are in us dollars  while a minor portion of our expenses are in canadian dollars and australian dollars 
we cannot predict any future trends in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar or australian dollar against the us dollar 
any strengthening of the canadian dollar or australian dollar in relation to the us dollar would increase the us dollar cost of our operations  and affect our us dollar measured results of operations 
we maintain bank accounts in both canadian dollars and australian dollars to meet short term operational operating requirements 
based on the balances in the canadian dollar and australian dollar denominated bank accounts at december   hypothetical increases of in the value of the canadian dollar and the australian dollar in relation to the us dollar would have minimal impact on the results of our operations 
we do not engage in any hedging or other transactions intended to manage these risks 
in the future  we may undertake hedging or other similar transactions or invest in market risk sensitive instruments if we determine that is advisable to offset these risks 

table of contents interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activity is to preserve principal while maximizing interest income we receive from our investments  without increasing risk 
we believe this will minimize our market risk 
we do not use interest rate derivative transactions to manage our interest rate risk 
we reduce our exposure to interest rate risk by investing in investment grade securities or money market accounts 
declines in interest rates over an extended period of time will reduce our interest income while an increase over an extended period of time will increase our interest income 
a reduction of interest rate by basis points over the year ended would reduce interest income by under
