our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems for use in a variety of network infrastructure equipment  including communications convergence processing triple play access gateways for voice over internet protocol voip and data processing platforms  broadband customer premises equipment cpe gateways and other equipment that carriers use to deliver voice  data and video services to residential subscribers  internet protocol ip private branch exchange pbx equipment and security appliances used in the enterprise and g g mobile base stations in the carrier infrastructure  high performance analog next generation fiber access network equipment including passive optical networking  or pon  systems  switching and signal conditioning products supporting fiber to the premise  optical transport networks otn  storage and server systems and broadcast video  inclusive of routers and other systems that are driving the migration to g high definition hd transmission  and wan communications circuit switched networking equipment that implements asynchronous transfer mode atm and t e and t e communications protocols 
our customers include alcatel lucent  cisco systems  inc  huawei technologies co 
ltd  hitachi ltd  lm ericsson telephone company  mitsubishi electric corporation  nokia siemens networks and zhongxing telecom equipment corp 
we report on a fifty two fifty three week fiscal year ending on the friday closest to september fiscal year comprised weeks and ended on september  fiscal year comprised weeks and ended on october  fiscal year comprised weeks and ended on october  trends and factors affecting our business our products are components of network infrastructure equipment 
as a result  we rely on network infrastructure oems to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment 
these design wins are an integral part of the long sales cycle for our products 
our customers may need six months or longer to test and evaluate our products and an additional six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
we believe our close relationships with leading network infrastructure oems facilitate early adoption of our products during development of their products  enhance our ability to obtain design wins and encourage adoption of our technology by the industry 
we believe our diverse portfolio of semiconductor solutions has us well positioned to capitalize on some of the most significant trends in telecommunications spending  including next generation network convergence  voip fiber access deployment in developing and developed markets  g g wireless infrastructure build out  the adoption of higher speed interconnectivity solutions  and the migration of broadcast video to hd 
we market and sell our semiconductor products directly to network infrastructure oems 
we also sell our products indirectly through electronic component distributors and third party electronic manufacturing service providers  who manufacture products incorporating our semiconductor networking solutions for oems 
sales to distributors accounted for approximately of our revenue for fiscal our revenue is well diversified globally  with of fiscal revenue coming from outside of the americas 
we believe a portion of the products we sell to oems and third party manufacturing service providers in the asia pacific region is ultimately shipped to end markets in the americas and europe 
we believe we are well situated in china  where fiber deployments are being rolled out by the country s major telecommunications carriers 
through our oem customers  we are shipping into the fiber to the building fttb deployments of china telecom  china unicom and china mobile 
approximately of our revenue for fiscal was derived from customers in china 
we have significant research  development  engineering and product design capabilities 
our success depends to a substantial degree upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely fashion new products and enhancements to our existing products that meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
we have made  and plan to make  substantial investments in research and development and to participate in the formulation of industry standards 
we spent approximately million on research and development in fiscal we seek to maximize our return on our research and development spending by focusing our research and development investment in what we believe are key growth markets  including voip and other high bandwidth multiservice access applications  high performance analog applications such as optical networking and broadcast video transmission  and wireless infrastructure solutions for base station processing 
we have developed and maintain a broad intellectual property portfolio  and we may periodically enter into strategic arrangements to leverage our portfolio by licensing or selling our intellectual property 
we are dependent upon third parties for the development  manufacturing  assembly and testing of our products 
our ability to bring new products to market  to fulfill orders and to achieve long term revenue growth is dependent upon our ability to obtain sufficient external manufacturing capacity  including wafer fabrication capacity 
periods of upturn in the semiconductor industry may be characterized by rapid increases in demand and a shortage of capacity for wafer fabrication and assembly and test services 
in such periods  we may experience longer lead times or indeterminate delivery schedules  which may adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders for our products 
during periods of capacity shortages for manufacturing  assembly and testing services  our primary foundries and other suppliers may devote their limited capacity to fulfill the requirements of their other customers that are larger than we are  or who have superior contractual rights to enforce manufacture of their products  including to the exclusion of producing our products 
the foundries and other suppliers on whom we rely may experience financial difficulties or suffer disruptions in their operations due to causes beyond our control  including deteriorations in general economic conditions  labor strikes  work stoppages  electrical power outages  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters 
we may also incur increased manufacturing costs  including costs of finding acceptable alternative foundries or assembly and test service providers 
in order to achieve sustained profitability and positive cash flows from operations  we may need to further reduce operating expenses and or increase our revenue 
we have completed a series of cost reduction actions  which have improved our operating cost structure  and we will continue to perform additional actions  when necessary 
our ability to achieve revenue growth will depend on increased demand for network infrastructure equipment that incorporates our products  which in turn depends primarily on the level of capital spending by communications service providers  the level of which may decrease due to general economic conditions and uncertainty  over which we have no control 
we believe the market for network infrastructure equipment in general  and for communications semiconductors in particular  offers attractive long term growth prospects due to increasing demand for network capacity  the continued upgrading and expansion of existing networks and the build out of telecommunication networks in developing countries 
however  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving technical standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
in addition  there has been an increasing trend toward industry consolidation  particularly among major network equipment and telecommunications companies 
consolidation in the industry has generally led to pricing pressure and loss of market share 
these factors have caused substantial fluctuations in our revenue and our results of operations in the past  and we may experience cyclical fluctuations in our business in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to inventories  stock based compensation  revenue recognition  income taxes and impairment of long lived assets 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
inventories we assess the recoverability of our inventories at least quarterly through a review of inventory levels in relation to foreseeable demand generally over months 
foreseeable demand is based upon all available information  including sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycles 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand  we write down the value of those inventories which  at the time of our review  we expect to be unable to sell 
the amount of the inventory write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
our products are used by oems that have designed our products into network infrastructure equipment 
for many of our products  we gain these design wins through a lengthy sales cycle  which often includes providing technical support to the oem customer 
in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers  we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins 
in the event that quantities of inventory on hand exceed foreseeable demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed  we generally are unable to sell our excess inventories to others  and the estimated realizable value of such inventories to us is generally zero 
we base our assessment of the recoverability of our inventories  and the amounts of any write downs  on currently available information and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize the fair value of each award as an expense over the service period 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based upon the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
for the majority of our awards  we estimate the fair value of stock option awards  as of the grant date  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of the black scholes model requires that we make a number of estimates  including the expected option term  the expected volatility in the price of our common stock  the risk free rate of interest and the dividend yield on our common stock 
if our expected option term and stock price volatility assumptions were different  the resulting determination of the fair value of stock option awards could be materially different 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that we expect will ultimately vest upon the fulfillment of service conditions such as time based vesting or the achievement of specific performance conditions 
if the actual number of awards that ultimately vest differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
we classify compensation expense related to these awards in our consolidated statement of operations based on the department to which the recipient reports 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from direct product sales  sales to distributors  maintenance contracts  development agreements and the sale and license of intellectual property 
we recognize revenue when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product  system  or solution is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
technical support services revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
advanced services revenue is recognized upon delivery or completion of performance 
we recognize revenue on products shipped directly to customers at the time the products are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement  and the four above mentioned revenue recognition criteria are met 
we recognize revenue on sales to distributors based on the rights granted to these distributors in our distribution agreements 
we have certain distributors who have been granted return rights and receive credits for changes in selling prices to end customers  the magnitude of which is not known at the time products are shipped to the distributor 
the return rights granted to these distributors consist of limited stock rotation rights  which allow them to rotate up to of the products in their inventory twice a year  as well as certain product return rights if the applicable distribution agreement is terminated 
these distributors also receive price concessions because they resell our products to end customers at various negotiated price points which vary by end customer  product  quantity  geography and competitive pricing environments 
when a distributor s resale is priced at a discount from the distributor s invoice price  we credit back to the distributor a portion of the distributor s original purchase price after the resale transaction is complete 
thus  a portion of the deferred income on sales to distributors balance will be credited back to the distributor in the future 
under these agreements  we defer recognition of revenue until the products are resold by the distributor  at which time our final net sales price is fixed and the distributor s right to return the products expires 
at the time of shipment to these distributors i we record a trade receivable at the invoiced selling price because there is a legally enforceable obligation from the distributor to pay us currently for product delivered  ii we relieve inventory for the carrying value of products shipped because legal title has passed to the distributor  and iii we record deferred revenue and deferred cost of inventory under the deferred income on sales to distributors caption in the liability section of our consolidated balance sheets 
we evaluate the deferred cost of inventory component of this account for possible impairment by considering potential obsolescence of products that might be returned to us and by considering the potential of resale prices of these products being below our cost 
by reviewing deferred inventory costs in the manners discussed above  we ensure that any portion of deferred inventory costs that are not recoverable from future contractual revenue are charged to cost of sales as an expense 
deferred income on sales to distributors effectively represents the gross margin on sales to distributors  however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods is typically less than the originally recorded deferred income as a result of negotiated price concessions 
in recent years  such concessions have exceeded of list price on average 
for detail of this account balance  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue from other distributors at the time of shipment and when title and risk of loss transfer to the distributor  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement  and when the four above mentioned revenue recognition criteria are met 
these distributors may also be given business terms to return a portion of inventory  however they do not receive credits for changes in selling prices to end customers 
at the time of shipment  product prices are fixed or determinable and the amount of future returns can be reasonably estimated and accrued 
our products are often integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified software upgrades and enhancements through our maintenance contracts for many of our products 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc  software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
for sales of products where software is not included or is incidental to the equipment  we apply the provisions of asc  revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
revenue from the sale and license of intellectual property is recognized when the above mentioned four revenue recognition criteria are met 
development revenue is recognized when services are performed and customer acceptance has been received and was not significant for any of the periods presented 
deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions we have provided a full valuation allowance against our u 
s federal and state deferred tax assets 
if sufficient positive evidence of our ability to generate future u 
s federal and or state taxable income becomes apparent  we may be required to reduce our valuation allowance  resulting in income tax benefits in our statement of operations 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly 
we follow asc  income taxes  for the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attributes for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under asc  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  the new interpretations provide guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the application of tax laws and regulations is subject to legal and factual interpretation  judgment and uncertainty 
tax laws and regulations themselves are subject to change as a result of changes in fiscal policy  changes in legislation  the evolution of regulations and court rulings 
therefore  the actual liability for us or foreign taxes may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional tax liabilities or potentially reverse previously recorded tax liabilities 
impairment of long lived assets we regularly monitor and review long lived assets  including fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets  for impairment including whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment of certain long lived assets 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued guidance regarding the presentation of comprehensive income 
the new standard requires the presentation of comprehensive income  the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
the new standard also requires presentation of adjustments for items that are reclassified from other comprehensive income to net income in the statement where the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income are presented 
the updated guidance is effective on a retrospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued additional guidance on fair value measurements that clarifies the application of existing guidance and disclosure requirements  changes certain fair value measurement principles and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
the updated guidance is effective on a prospective basis for financial statements issued for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb reached a consensus on the milestone method of revenue recognition  which provides guidance on the criteria that should be met for determining whether the milestone method of revenue recognition is appropriate 
a vendor can recognize consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of a milestone in its entirety as revenue in the period in which the milestone is achieved only if the milestone meets all criteria to be considered substantive 
the updated guidance is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on accounting standards update  or asu   revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  or asu and asu  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  or asu asu modifies the requirements that must be met for an entity to recognize revenue from the sale of a delivered item that is part of a multiple element arrangement when other items have not yet been delivered 
asu eliminates the requirement that all undelivered elements must have either i vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value  or ii third party evidence tpe before an entity can recognize the portion of an overall arrangement consideration that is attributable to items that have already been delivered 
in the absence of vsoe or tpe of the standalone selling price for one or more delivered or undelivered elements in a multiple element arrangement  entities will be required to estimate the selling prices of those elements 
overall arrangement consideration will be allocated to each element both delivered and undelivered items based on their relative selling prices  regardless of whether those selling prices are evidenced by vsoe or tpe or are based on the entity s estimated selling price 
the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration has been eliminated 
asu modifies the software revenue recognition guidance to exclude from its scope tangible products that contain both software and non software components that function together to deliver a product s essential functionality 
these new updates are effective for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the adoption of these provisions did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
results of operations net revenue the following table summarizes net revenue by product line for fiscal compared to fiscal year ended september  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages communications convergence processing high performance analog wan communications total net product revenue intellectual property net revenue the decrease in our net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal mainly reflects lower sales volumes in our wan communications products and lower revenue from the sale of intellectual property 
these decreases were partially offset by higher sales volume in our communications convergence processing products and our high performance analog products 
net revenue from our wan communications products decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a slowdown in demand at several large customers  particularly in atm based systems 
wan communications products represent a legacy business for us  as we have shifted almost all of our research and development investment into our two growth businesses of communications convergence processing products and high performance analog products 
net revenue from intellectual property licensing and sales decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a decline in intellectual property sales in fiscal net revenue from our communications convergence processing products increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal  due to an increase in shipments of cpe products  which are used in broadband cpe gateways and other equipment that service providers are deploying in order to deliver voice  data and video services to residential subscribers 
within communications convergence processing  we also experienced an increase in shipments for fttb deployments  particularly to customers in china 
net revenue from high performance analog products increased in fiscal when compared to fiscal  primarily due to increased demand for physical media devices  which are primarily used in equipment for fiber to the premise deployments 
the following table summarizes net revenue by product line for fiscal compared to fiscal year ended october  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages communications convergence processing high performance analog wan communications total net product revenue intellectual property net revenue for fiscal  the increase in our net revenue compared to fiscal primarily reflects higher sales volume in all three of our product families  as well as an increase in the sales and licensing of our intellectual property 
net revenue from our communications convergence processing products increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  mainly reflecting an increase in shipments of our cpe products  which are used in broadband home gateways and other equipment used by service providers in fiber to the home deployments in order to deliver voice  data and video services to residential subscribers 
within communications convergence processing  we also experienced an increase in shipments for fttb deployments  particularly to customers in china 
net revenue from our high performance analog products increased when comparing fiscal to fiscal due primarily to increased demand for crosspoint switches primarily related to strength in the optical transport market and broadcast video market  and increased demand for our physical media devices as we expanded into the gigabit passive optical networking gpon market 
net revenue from our wan communications products increased mainly reflecting an increase in shipments of our network processor products and our carrier ethernet products in fiscal net revenue from intellectual property licensing and sales increased in fiscal compared to fiscal  due to the sale of certain intellectual property in two significant transactions in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross margin gross margin represents net revenue less cost of goods sold 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we use third parties including taiwan semiconductor manufacturing co  ltd  amkor technology  inc and advanced semiconductor engineering  inc for wafer fabrication and assembly and test services 
our cost of goods sold consists predominantly of purchased finished wafers  assembly and test services  royalty and other intellectual property costs  labor and overhead costs associated with product procurement  amortization of the cost of mask sets purchased  and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold 
the following table presents gross margin for fiscal compared to fiscal year ended september  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages gross margin our gross margin for fiscal decreased from fiscal  principally reflecting a million decrease in product sales and a million decrease in intellectual property revenue in fiscal the decrease in our gross margin as a percent of net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the sale of intellectual property  which had little associated cost  as well as a change in product mix 
the following table presents gross margin for fiscal compared to fiscal year ended october  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages gross margin our gross margin for fiscal increased from fiscal  principally reflecting an increase in both product and intellectual property revenue in fiscal  as well as the effect of asset impairment charges recorded in the second quarter of fiscal our fiscal product sales increased million  or  compared to fiscal and our sale or licensing of intellectual property increased million  or 
the increase in our gross margin as a percent of net revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the effect of asset impairment charges incurred in fiscal and increased sales of higher margin intellectual property in fiscal research and development our research and development r d expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs  photomasks  electronic design automation tools and pre production evaluation and test costs 
the following table presents details of research and development expense for fiscal compared to fiscal year ended september  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages personnel related costs stock based compensation design and development costs facilities depreciation other research and development the increase in r d expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily driven by increased investment in our next generation products in both the wireless and enterprise markets that resulted in an increase in design and development costs  including engineering tools  contracted engineering services and depreciation on engineering equipment  and increase in personnel costs  including stock based compensation  as a result of increased headcount 
the following table presents details of research and development expense for fiscal compared to fiscal year ended october  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages personnel related costs stock based compensation design and development costs facilities depreciation other research and development the increase in r d expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily driven by an increase in compensation and personnel related costs  including stock based compensation expense 
this increase was due to both a management bonus accrual in accordance with our fiscal cash bonus plan  as well as an increase in headcount within our communications convergence processing and high performance analog groups 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in the cost of our facilities  which was mainly the result of entering into a new corporate headquarters lease at a more favorable rental rate than we had previously 
selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include personnel costs  independent sales representative commissions and product marketing  applications engineering and other marketing costs 
our sg a expenses also include costs of corporate functions  including accounting  finance  legal  human resources  information systems and communications

these increases were partially offset by a decrease in personnel related costs resulting from headcount reductions associated with our most recent restructuring  as well as a decrease in our accrual for management s bonus 
the following table presents details of selling  general and administrative expense for fiscal compared to fiscal year ended october  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages personnel related costs stock based compensation professional fees and outside services facilities depreciation other selling  general and administrative the decrease in our sg a expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in the cost of our facilities  which was primarily due to our entering into a new corporate headquarters lease at a more favorable rental rate than we had previously 
in addition  the decrease in sg a in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to a decrease in the cost of our professional fees and insurance 
these decreases in sg a expenses were mostly offset by an increase in compensation  including stock based compensation expense 
the increase in compensation  including stock based compensation expense  reflected a decrease in costs resulting from headcount reductions associated with our restructuring activities  which was more than offset by an increase in compensation expense related to a management bonus accrual in accordance with our fiscal cash bonus plan  as well as an increase in stock compensation expense 
special charges special charges consisted of the following year ended september  october  october  in thousands asset impairments restructuring charges total special charges asset impairments during fiscal  we did not record any asset impairment charges 
during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges of  these impairment charges consisted of property and equipment that we determined to abandon or scrap 
during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges of million 
included in this amount were asset impairment charges of approximately  related to software and property and equipment that we determined to abandon or scrap  as well as asset impairment charges of million to write down the carrying value of goodwill related to our acquisition of certain assets of ample communications 
in the second quarter of fiscal  our ample communications reporting unit experienced a severe decline in sales and profitability due to a significant decline in demand that we believe was a result of the downturn in global economic conditions  as well as a bankruptcy filed by the reporting unit s most significant customer 
the drop in market demand resulted in significant declines in unit sales 
due to these market and economic conditions  our ample communications reporting unit experienced a significant decline in market value 
as a result  we concluded that there were sufficient factual circumstances for interim impairment analyses 
accordingly  in the second quarter of fiscal  we performed a goodwill impairment assessment 
based on the results of our assessment of goodwill for impairment  we determined that the carrying value of the ample communications reporting unit exceeded its estimated fair value 
therefore  we performed a second step of the impairment test to estimate the implied fair value of goodwill 
the required analysis indicated that there would be no remaining implied value attributable to goodwill in the ample communications reporting unit and we impaired the entire goodwill balance of million 
we continually monitor and review long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  for possible impairment 
future impairment tests may result in significant write downs of the value of our assets 
restructuring charges we have from time to time  and may in the future  commit to restructuring plans to help manage our costs or to help implement strategic initiatives  among other reasons 
mindspeed fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we committed to the implementation of a restructuring plan 
the plan consisted primarily of a targeted headcount reduction in our selling  general and administrative functions and wan business unit 
the restructuring plan was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal we incurred million of charges related to severance costs for the affected employees 
activity and liability balances related to our fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring plan through september  were as follows workforce reductions in thousands charges to costs and expenses cash payments restructuring balance  september  mindspeed fourth quarter of fiscal restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we committed to the implementation of a restructuring plan 
the plan consisted primarily of a targeted headcount reduction in its wan product family and selling  general and administrative functions 
the restructuring plan was substantially completed during the fiscal fourth quarter of of the million in charges incurred   related to severance costs for affected employees and  related to abandoned technology 
activity and liability balances related to our fourth quarter of fiscal through september  were as follows workforce reductions facility and other total in thousands charges to costs and expenses cash payments non cash asset write downs restructuring balance  october  cash payments non cash credits restructuring balance  september  the remaining accrued restructuring balance principally represents employee severance benefits 
we expect to pay these remaining obligations in the first quarter of fiscal mindspeed fiscal restructuring plans in fiscal  we implemented two restructuring plans to improve our operating structure 
these restructuring plans included workforce reductions  closure of facilities and reductions in areas of selling  general and administrative and wan communications spending 
at october   the total remaining accrued restructuring balance under these plans was  during the first quarter of fiscal  any amounts left to be paid under these plans were paid and any remaining accrued amounts were reversed 
at september   there was no remaining accrued restructuring balance related to these plans 
interest expense the following tables present interest expense for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal year ended september  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages interest expense year ended october  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages interest expense interest expense for fiscal  and primarily represented interest on our convertible senior notes issued in december and july the decline in our interest expense charge from fiscal through fiscal corresponded to the decrease in our overall debt balance during that period 
in november  we repaid the remaining million due under our convertible senior notes  thereby decreasing our interest expense related to these notes for the remainder of fiscal in october  we repurchased million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes  thereby decreasing our interest expense related to these notes for the remainder of fiscal as a result of adopting asc on october   we have separately accounted for the liability and equity components of our convertible senior notes  retrospectively  which resulted in recognizing interest expense based on the entity s borrowing rate at the time of issuance for similar unsecured senior debt without an equity conversion feature 
pre tax non cash interest expense attributable to the adoption was  in fiscal   in fiscal and million in fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the adoption of asc other income  net the following table presents other income  net  for fiscal compared to fiscal year ended september  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages other income  net other income  net  principally consisted of interest income  income from reimbursable foreign r d incentives  foreign exchange gains and losses and other non operating gains and losses  including gains losses on debt extinguishments 
the increase in other income  net  in fiscal compared to fiscal principally reflected million in reimbursable foreign research and development credits recorded in other income in fiscal this increase in other income was partially offset by approximately  in net foreign exchange losses recorded in fiscal compared to  in net foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal year ended october  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages other income  net the decrease in other income  net  in fiscal compared to fiscal principally reflected the million gain we recorded in connection with the extinguishment of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes for cash of million in fiscal see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the adoption of asc this decrease in other income  net  was partially offset by approximately  in net foreign exchange gains recorded in fiscal compared to net foreign exchange loss of  in fiscal provision for income taxes the following tables present provision for income taxes for fiscal compared to fiscal and fiscal compared to fiscal year ended september  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes year ended october  of net revenue october  of net revenue change in thousands  except percentages provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes for fiscal and principally consisted of income taxes incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
our provision for income taxes for fiscal principally consisted of income tax due on operating income generated in the us a substantial portion of this operating income was offset by previously generated net operating losses  thereby reducing the effective tax rate on us earnings 
as of september   we had a valuation allowance of million against our us federal and state deferred tax assets which reduces their carrying value to zero because we continue to believe that it is unlikely that we will realize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of future income tax payments 
we have considered both positive and negative evidence in reaching this determination and placed considerable weight upon the cumulative losses over the past three year period 
as of september   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  including the net operating loss carryforwards we retained in the distribution 
we can provide no assurances that we will be able to retain or fully utilize such net operating loss carryforwards  or that such net operating loss carryforwards will not be significantly limited in the future 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalent balances and cash generated from product sales 
in order to achieve and sustain profitability and sustain positive cash flows from operations  we may need to further reduce operating expenses and or increase revenue 
we have completed a series of cost reduction actions  which have improved our operating expense structure  and we will continue to perform additional actions  if necessary 
in addition  we may commit to additional restructurings to help implement strategic initiatives 
these restructurings and other cost saving measures alone may not allow us to achieve and sustain profitability 
our ability to maintain  or increase  current revenue levels to achieve and sustain profitability will depend on demand for network infrastructure equipment that incorporates our products  which in turn depends primarily on the level of capital spending by communications service providers and enterprises  the level of which may decrease due to general economic conditions  and uncertainty  over which we have no control 
we may be unable to maintain  or increase current revenue levels or sustain past and future expense reductions in subsequent periods 
we may not be able to achieve and sustain profitability 
we believe that our existing cash balances  along with cash expected to be generated from product sales  will be sufficient to fund our operations  research and development efforts  anticipated capital expenditures  working capital and other financing requirements  including interest payments on debt obligations  for the next months 
in november  we repaid the million outstanding balance of our senior convertible notes  and we have no other principal payments on currently outstanding debt due in the next months 
from time to time  we may acquire our debt securities through privately negotiated transactions  tender offers  exchange offers for new debt or other securities  redemptions or otherwise  upon such terms and at such prices as we may determine appropriate 
we will need to continue a focused program of capital expenditures to meet our research and development and corporate requirements 
we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings 
in order to fund capital expenditures  increase our working capital or complete any acquisitions  we may seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
we may also need to seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing if we experience downturns or cyclical fluctuations in our business that are more severe or longer than anticipated or if we fail to achieve anticipated revenue and expense levels 
however  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all  particularly in light of recent economic conditions in the capital markets

in the first quarter of fiscal  we used cash when we paid million to retire the remaining principal amount of our convertible senior notes  which matured in november offsetting this use of cash was million in net proceeds we received from the sale of approximately million shares of our common stock in an offering that was completed in the second quarter of fiscal we also generated cash from financing activities of million in proceeds received in conjunction with the exercise of stock options in fiscal financing activities used cash in fiscal due to million paid in the first quarter of fiscal to retire million in principal amount of our convertible senior notes due in november and to approximately  of debt issuance costs related to both our revolving credit facility and the issuance of our convertible senior notes due in partially offsetting these uses of cash was million in net proceeds we received from the sale of million shares of our common stock in an offering that was completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal convertible senior notes convertible senior notes due in december  we sold an aggregate principal amount of million in convertible senior notes due in november for net proceeds after discounts and commissions of approximately million

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 
interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
as of september   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximated fair value 
at september   our debt consisted of long term convertible senior notes 
our convertible senior notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 
consequently  our results of operations and cash flows are not subject to any significant interest rate risk relating to our convertible senior notes 
the fair value of the debt could increase or decrease if interest rates decreases or increase  respectively  and that could impact our ability and cost to negotiate a settlement of such notes prior to maturity 
foreign exchange risk we transact business in various foreign currencies and we face foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
currently  our foreign exchange risks are not hedged  however  from time to time  we may utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
these hedging transactions are intended to offset the gains and losses we experience on foreign currency transactions with gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate our overall risk of foreign exchange gains and losses 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
at september   we held no foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at september   a change in currency rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
