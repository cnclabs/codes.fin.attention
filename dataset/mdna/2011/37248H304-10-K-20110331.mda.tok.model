item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our future plans  estimates  beliefs and expected performance 
the forward looking statements are dependent upon events  risks and uncertainties that may be outside our control 
see cautionary information about forward looking statements 
business overview we are an oil and gas company in the business of exploring and developing oil and natural gas reserves on a worldwide basis 
since inception  we have conducted leasehold acquisition  exploration and drilling activities on our north american  australian and indonesian prospects 
these projects currently encompass approximately  gross  net acres  consisting of mineral leases  production sharing contracts and exploration permits that give us the right to explore for  develop and produce oil and natural gas 
most of these properties are in the exploration  appraisal or development drilling phase and have not begun to produce revenue from the sale of oil and natural gas 
excluding minor interest and dividend income  our only significant cash inflows until were the recovery of capital invested in projects through sale or other divestiture of interests in oil and gas prospects to industry partners 
our objective is to increase shareholder value by profitably growing our reserves  production  revenue  and cash flow by focusing primarily on our projects in texas  alaska  california  canada  indonesia  and certain new venture opportunities 
since  substantially all of our revenue has been generated from natural gas sales derived from the magness  the fannin  and the mitchell wells in the madisonville field in east texas under spot gas purchase contracts at market prices 
natural gas sales from the madisonville field are expected to account for substantially all of our revenues for we expect the majority of our capital expenditures in will be for the madisonville project 
for the years ended december  consolidated statement of operations revenues plant operating expense lease operating expense general and administrative net profits expense impairment expense depreciation and depletion expense loss from operations net loss net loss attributable to common shareholders revenue and operating trends in as discussed in the properties texas madisonville project section of this annual report  in order to produce the gas reserves from the rodessa formation  we developed an onsite plan to treat and remove impurities from the madisonville project natural gas in order to meet pipeline quality specifications 
in  a third party completed the construction and installation of a natural gas treatment plant with a designed capacity of million cubic feet of gas per day mmcf d and associated pipeline and gathering facilities 
in we secured a commitment from mgp to install and make operational additional treating facilities capable of treating mmcf d  which combined with the capacity of the current in service treating facilities will represent a total designed treating capacity of mmcf d for the madisonville treatment plant 
in early november  mgp began testing the additional treatment facilities by accepting mmcf d at the inlet 
subsequently in december  mgp suspended the operations of the additional treatment facilities in order to make modifications to more effectively deal with the presence of diamondoids in the gas stream produced from the rodessa formation 
during  mgp analyzed various options for removing the diamondoids  however  they did not complete the necessary plant system modifications 
on december   we purchased the gas treatment plant and related gathering pipeline from mgp in exchange for assumption of secured debt  payment of certain outstanding payables of mgp and shares of geopetro s common stock 
the effective date of the acquisition was december  and the new owner of the plant is geopetro s wholly owned  indirect subsidiary  madisonville midstream llc mm 
we expect to complete installation of the system modifications required in the new plant in in the meantime  the existing  in service portion of the plant continues to operate with a design capacity of up to approximately mmcf d of inlet gas 
while there can be no assurance  our goal is to make the necessary upgrades to the plant and increase the production rates from our wells which may result in higher net production and increased revenue during as compared to and prior periods 
to accomplish the plant upgrades  we will need to raise capital in due to the unsettled state of the capital markets  funds may not be available  or may not be available on favorable terms 

table of contents industry overview for the year ended december  natural gas prices have historically been volatile 
price volatility during and relates to supply concerns earlier in  and more recently due to recession concerns arising from the current global financial crisis and a resultant decline in demand for natural gas 
the houston ship channel price  the index price prevailing in the locale of our madisonville project in madison county  texas  as quoted in gas daily as of december  was per mcf versus per mcf as of december  fluctuations in the price for natural gas are closely associated with customer demand relative to the volumes produced and the level of inventory in underground storage 
company overview in our net loss after taxes for the year ended december  was  from our inception  through mid  we only received nominal revenues from our oil and natural gas activities  while incurring substantial acquisition and exploration costs and overhead expenses which have resulted in an accumulated deficit through december  of  commencing in may  we placed our madisonville project into production 
substantially all of our revenues for the year ended december  were derived from our madisonville project  from three producing wells  the umc ruby magness well the magness well  the angela farris fannin well the fannin well  and the mitchell well the mitchell well 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  and during the twelve months ended december   we had gross natural gas revenues  during this period  our gross production from our wells was  mcf and our average natural gas price realized was per mcf 
during the twelve months ended december   we had natural gas revenues of  and our gross production was  mcf of natural gas at an average price of per mcf 
revenues decreased in the twelve months ended december  as compared to the prior year period mainly due to lower production volumes 
the lower production volumes for the twelve months ended december  as compared to the same period of was due to natural decline curves as well as treatment plant downtime partially offset by a increase in average natural gas prices 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred plant operating expenses of  as compared to  in the same prior year period 
the decrease of  or was attributable to cost cutting measures comprised primarily of reduced costs associated with field personnel  chemicals  electricity and ad valorem taxes 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred lease operating expense of  our average lifting cost for the period was per mcf 
during the twelve months ended december   we incurred lease operating expense of  our average lifting cost for the period was per mcf 
despite overall lease operating expenses being lower in  the average lifting cost per mcf was higher during the period  due to fixed costs associated with field personnel  insurance costs  workover costs  and ad valorem property taxes applicable to the wells  on a lower base of production volume 
general and administrative g a expenses for the twelve months ended december  were  compared to  for the twelve months ended december  this represents a  or decrease over the prior year period 
the net reduction in g a expense incurred in was due primarily to reduced salaries  professional fees  and insurance  partially offset by an increase in rent expense 
for the year ended december   impairment expense was nil versus  for the same period of the impairment write downs were due to i dry holes drilled on our canadian oil and gas properties  and ii writeoff remaining costs related to the south bengara due to project cancellation iii million impairment in the madisonville project in us  which resulted from ceiling test write limitations 
depreciation and depletion expense for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  in the same period of  which amounts primarily represent depletion of the oil and gas properties for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was due to decreased depletion expense resulting from lower net production in the twelve months period of as well as lower carrying value of oil and gas properties resulting from ceiling test write off in the us cost pool recorded during the fiscal year ended december  during the twelve months ended december   a gain was realized in connection with the settlement of previously accrued liabilities related to the devon royalty rights in the amount of  during the twelve months ended december   a gain on the sale of equipment of  was realized relating to the sale of idle equipment in the madisonville plant 

table of contents during the twelve months ended december  and  interest expense was incurred in the amount of  and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense is due to a decrease in indebtedness on notes payable during the period  and by the replacement of certain loans with new instruments bearing lower interest rates 
net loss before taxes for the twelve months ended december  was  as compared to  for the twelve months ended december  the decrease in net loss during the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the fact that we recorded no impairment expense  experienced reduced depletion expense and lower general and administrative expense 
in addition operating costs decreased at a rate higher than decreased production revenues  thereby providing a positive change in operating margin year over year 
recent developments on february   we entered into a new lease for our principal executive office to be located at california street  suite  san francisco  ca the terms of the lease provide for an eighty four month term 
minimum annual rentals due under this agreement as of december  are as follows total on february   we sold our entire working interest in our alaskan leases to linc  an australian based company publicly traded on the australian stock exchange 
linc acquired all of the alaskan leases for the following consideration a cash payment of million  a million payment from the first of ths of the proceeds from any oil and gas production from the alaskan leases  after we have received the million payment specified in paragraph b above  we will thereafter receive an over riding royalty interest of of ths in and to the alaskan leases issued by the state of alaska and the alaska mental health trust on conventional oil and gas production and coal bed methane production  and linc has agreed to pay all of the costs of maintaining the alaskan leases at least through the end of the primary lease term 
on november   linc completed the drilling of the lea exploration well in the point mackenzie block of the cook inlet basin in alaska 
a testing program to evaluate the potential for commercial gas production from the well will be undertaken 
in addition to testing the lea  linc energy has stated that it will prepare for phase two of its alaskan natural gas drilling program in the trading bay block leases which are located on the northwest side of the cook inlet approximately miles from the site of lea on march   j

our current cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures and growth strategy requirements for the foreseeable future 
see outlook for for a description of our expected capital expenditures for if we are unable to generate revenues necessary to finance our operations over the long term  we may have to seek additional capital through the sale of our equity or borrowing 
as noted in recent developments  we periodically borrow funds pursuant to promissory notes to finance our activities 
as discussed in the outlook for  we are forecasting capital expenditures of million during we will need to obtain adequate sources of cash to fund our anticipated capital expenditures through the end of  to fund ongoing operations and to follow through with plans for continued investments in oil and gas properties 
our success  in part  depends on our ability to generate additional financing and farm out certain of our projects 
additionally  as a result of the economic downturn  we may have difficulty raising sufficient funds to meet our projected funding requirements 
see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business 
since our inception  we have participated as a working interest owner in the acquisition of undeveloped leases  seismic options  lease options and foreign concessions and have participated in seismic surveys and the drilling of test wells on our undeveloped properties 
further leasehold acquisitions  drilling and seismic operations are planned for and future periods 
in addition  exploratory and development drilling is scheduled during and future periods on our undeveloped properties 
it is anticipated that these exploration activities together with others that may be entered into will impose financial requirements which will exceed our existing working capital 
we may raise additional equity and or debt capital  and we may farm out certain of our projects to finance our continued participation in planned activities 
however  if additional financing is not available  we may be compelled to reduce the scope of our business activities 
if we are unable to fund planned expenditures  it may be necessary to farm out our interest in proposed wells  sell a portion of our interest in prospects and use the sale proceeds to fund our participation for a lesser interest  reduce general and administrative expenses  and or forfeit our interest in wells that are proposed to be drilled 
selling certain underutilized equipment from our gas plant 
table of contents outlook for capital depending on capital availability  we are forecasting capital spending of up to approximately  during the year  allocated as follows madisonville project  madison county  texas approximately  may be expended in the madisonville field area as follows  million for capital maintenance and repair on new gas treatment plant   toward the fracture stimulation and hook up costs of the wilson well  and  for the mitchell well workover 
california approximately  to be utilized for land and permitting costs 
we may  in our discretion  decide to allocate resources towards other projects in addition to or in lieu of  those listed above should other opportunities arise and as circumstances warrant 
we currently do not have sufficient working capital to fund the majority of the capital expenditures listed above 
we may  in our discretion  fund the foregoing planned expenditures from operating cash flows  asset sales  potential debt and equity issuances and or a combination of all four 
the madisonville project forecasted capital expenditures will play an important part in the company achieving our cash flow projections 
see liquidity and capital resources 
we expect commodity prices to be volatile  reflecting the current supply and demand fundamentals for north american natural gas and world crude oil 
political and economic events around the world  which are difficult to predict  will continue to influence both oil and gas prices 
significant price changes for oil and gas often lead to changes in the levels of drilling activity which in turn lead to changes in costs to explore  develop and acquire oil and gas reserves 
significant change in costs could affect the returns on our capital expenditures 
higher crude prices could also help keep natural gas prices high by keeping alternative fuels  such as heating oil and residual fuel  expensive 
income taxes as of december   geopetro had net operating loss nol carryforwards of approximately  for federal income tax purposes which begin to expire in if the company were to experience a change in ownership under section  the company may be limited in its ability to fully utilize its net operating losses 
however  in accordance with asc formerly sfas r  a deferred tax asset has not been recognized for the portion of the net operating loss carryforwards that is attributable to excess tax deductions associated with the exercise of stock options which do not reduce income taxes payable 
accordingly  approximately  of geopetro s federal nol has not been benefited for financial statement purposes as it relates to excess tax deductions that have not reduced income taxes payable 
the benefit of these excess tax deductions will not be recognized for financial statement purposes until the related deductions reduce income taxes payable 
the company also has approximately  of california net operating losses and approximately  of alaska net operating losses which begin to expire in and  respectively 
in accordance with asc  a portion of the state nols has similarly not been benefited for financial statement purposes as it relates to excess tax deductions which have not resulted in the reduction of income taxes payable 
the benefit of such excess tax deductions will not be recognized for financial statement purposes until the related deductions reduce state income taxes payable 
in addition  the company has approximately  of carryforward credits in texas  a portion of which may be utilized each year against texas margin tax liability through a significant change in our ownership may limit our ability to use these nol carryforwards 
asc  accounting for income taxes formerly statement of financial accounting standards no 
 requires that the tax benefit of such net operating loss be recorded as an asset 
at december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately  related to the nol and other temporary differences 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance of  at december  due to uncertainties surrounding the realizability of the deferred tax asset 
off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we may enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   our off balance sheet arrangements and transactions include operating lease agreements and gas transportation commitments 
we do not believe that these arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
financial instruments we currently have no natural gas price financial instruments or hedges in place 
similarly  we have no financial derivatives 
our natural gas marketing contracts use spot market prices 
given the uncertainty of the timing and volumes of our natural gas production this year  we do not currently plan to enter into any long term fixed price natural gas contracts  swap or hedge positions  other gas financial instruments or financial derivatives in 
table of contents impact of inflation changing prices as the following table illustrates  average sales prices of natural gas have changed in the past two years 
this has led to changes in revenues and earnings from operations for the year ended december  average sales prices per mcf net production volume mcf revenues loss from operations loss from operations includes  impairment expense we are highly dependent upon natural gas pricing 
a material decrease in current and projected natural gas prices could impair our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms 
likewise  a material decrease in current and projected natural gas prices could also impact our revenues and cash flows 
this could impact our ability to fund future activities 
changing prices have had a significant impact on costs of drilling and completing wells  particularly in the madisonville field area where we are currently the most active 
the estimated cost of drilling and completing a rodessa formation well at approximately  feet of depth has increased from million in to million in due to higher costs associated with tubular goods  well equipment  and day rates for drilling contracts  among other factors 
these higher costs have impacted and will continue to impact our income from operations in the form of higher depletion expense 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared by management in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes the most critical accounting policies that may have an impact on our financial results relate to the accounting for oil and gas properties 
amortization  abandonment costs and full cost ceiling limitation write downs are all based on numerous estimates  many of which are beyond management s control 
reserves valuation is central to much of the accounting for an oil and gas company as described below 
significant accounting policies are contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
a summary of unaudited supplementary oil and gas reserve information is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following discusses the accounting estimates that are critical in determining the reported financial results oil and gas properties we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as prescribed by us gaap and  accordingly  capitalize all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development drilling of proved oil and gas properties  including the costs of abandoned properties  dry holes  geophysical costs  and lease rentals 
all general corporate costs are expensed as incurred 
in general  sales or other dispositions of oil and gas properties are accounted for as adjustments to capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recorded 
amortization of proved oil and gas properties is computed on the units of production method based on all proved reserves on a country by country basis 
unproved oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment either individually or on an aggregate basis 
the net capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties full cost ceiling limitation are not to exceed their related estimated future net revenues discounted at  and the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  net of tax considerations 
reserves we engage independent petroleum engineering consultants to evaluate our reserves 
reserves  future production profiles  and net revenues are estimated by independent professional reservoir engineering firms 
while we engage qualified reservoir engineering firms  their estimates are inherently uncertain  involve numerous assumptions that may not be realized  and predict asset values that may not be indicative of the true market value of the assets evaluated 
as a result of the inherent uncertainties and changing technical and economic assumptions  reserve estimates are subject to revisions that can materially impact our results 

table of contents stock based compensation the company has a stock based compensation plan that allows employees to purchase common shares of the company 
option exercise prices approximate the market price for the common shares on the date the options were issued 
options granted under the plan are generally fully exercisable within five years and expire five to ten years after the grant date 
we measure and record stock based awards to directors  employees and consultants based on the grant date fair value  determined using the black scholes option pricing model with assumptions for risk free interest rates  expected dividend yield  expected life of the option  and the expected volatility 
we record the compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period defined in the award 
the company recorded  and  of stock based employee compensation for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
risks and uncertainties there are a number of risks that face participants in the us  canadian and international oil and natural gas industry  including a number of risks that face us in particular 
accordingly  there are risks involved in an ownership of our securities 
see risk factors for a description of the principal risks faced by us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks arising from fluctuating prices of crude oil  natural gas and interest rates as discussed below 
commodity risk 
our major commodity price risk exposure is to the prices received for our natural gas production 
realized commodity prices received for our production are the spot prices applicable to natural gas in the east texas region 
prices received for natural gas are volatile and unpredictable and are beyond our control 
currency translation risk 
because our revenues and expenses are primarily in us dollars  we have little exposure to currency translation risk  and  therefore  we have no plans in the foreseeable future to implement hedges or financial instruments to manage international currency changes 
hedging 
we did not enter into any hedging transactions during the years ended december  or
