pt selling and administrative percentage pt operating margin pt effective tax rate pt net earnings margin pt fiscal year versus fiscal year our fiscal year operating performance improved from fiscal year primarily due to a million or increase in net sales 
the incremental net sales allowed us to leverage our fixed manufacturing costs and increase our gross margin percentage to from in the million increase in net sales was the result of a million increase at our engine mobile filtration segment and a million increase at our packaging segment 
the net sales increase at our packaging segment includes a no margin million tooling and equipment sale to one of our customers 
net sales at our industrial environmental filtration segment increased million compared with fiscal year despite a million decline in hvac filter sales to m 
the increase in operating margin to in fiscal year from in fiscal year was primarily the result of the point improvement in gross margin percentage 
this point improvement was a result of the net sales increase and the associated leveraging of fixed manufacturing costs in addition to the cost benefits from the restructuring of our hvac filter operations 
the gross margin percentage in fiscal year was our highest annual gross margin percentage in almost twenty years 
selling and administrative expenses in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales were consistent with fiscal year but increased million primarily as a result of incremental employee compensation associated with our company wide profit sharing program and additional legal expenses partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense 
the operating margin in fiscal year not only was points greater than fiscal year  but it was equivalent to the operating margin from fiscal year despite million lower net sales 
we were able to generate a fiscal year operating margin equivalent to fiscal year despite lower net sales as a result of various cost efficiencies implemented in including the benefits of the aforementioned restructuring program at our hvac filter operations 
as a result of this improved operating performance  diluted earnings per share of in fiscal year was greater than diluted earnings per share of in fiscal year and greater than diluted earnings per share of in fiscal year fiscal year versus fiscal year fiscal year was a challenging year as we were significantly impacted by the global economic recession 
our net sales declined million or from fiscal year this sales reduction and the resulting under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs was the primary reason for our reduced operating profit which declined or million from fiscal year the negative impact of lower net sales was offset in part by three significant cost items in fiscal year compared with fiscal year lower material costs  reduced discretionary spending and the benefits from hvac filter operations restructuring program 
we realized an approximate million benefit from the reduction of material costs in fiscal year compared with fiscal year this reduction was driven by lower commodity pricing primarily in steel  filter media and adhesives 
in addition  we initiated several projects in fiscal year which removed material cost from our products without compromising the quality of the product to the end customer 
due to the challenging economic environment in fiscal year  we established several cost initiatives including headcount reductions  wage freezes and significant cuts in discretionary spending including travel and outside professional services 
as a result of these cost initiatives  we were able to reduce our selling and administrative expenses by million from fiscal year despite this focus on lower costs  we did not sacrifice spending on future growth initiatives including our sales force  customer service or product development 
we largely completed our restructuring program at our hvac filter operations in fiscal year at the beginning of fiscal year  we completed the consolidation of two manufacturing operations  one distribution facility and one office location into one facility in indiana 
as a result of this consolidation and the full year benefits of facilities closed in fiscal year  we recognized approximately million in fixed cost savings in fiscal year compared to fiscal year these fixed cost savings were offset in part by a million impairment charge recognized on a hvac facility in north carolina which we closed in fiscal year other items other significant items impacting the comparison between the years presented are as follows acquisitions we completed no acquisitions in fiscal year and six acquisitions in fiscal year the net sales and operating profit impact of these six acquisitions for comparisons between fiscal years  and was not significant 
at the beginning of fiscal year  we completed the acquisition of perry equipment corporation peco  a manufacturer of engineered filtration products and technologies primarily in the natural gas industry 
the purchase price was million  excluding cash acquired 
net sales and operating profit results from the peco acquisition are included in all fiscal years presented 
foreign exchange the average exchange rate for foreign currencies in which we transact business was higher in fiscal year compared with fiscal year as a result  the us dollar value of our net sales in fiscal year was positively influenced by million and operating profit by million 
weaker foreign currencies negatively impacted our translated fiscal year results compared with fiscal year as a result  the us dollar value of net sales in declined million and operating profit declined million 
other income expense interest expense interest expense declined million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year million of this decrease was due to the impact of a mark to market adjustment on an interest rate swap agreement in the remaining million decline primarily resulted from lower interest expense on our line of credit driven by a lower average interest rate in fiscal year and in fiscal year and lower average outstanding balances million in fiscal year and million in fiscal 
interest expense declined million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year debt had increased in due to the peco acquisition 
million of this decrease was driven by lower interest expense on our line of credit driven by both a lower average interest rate in fiscal year and in fiscal year and lower average outstanding balances million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year 
in addition  the million mark to market adjustment on the interest rate swap in fiscal year was million lower than the adjustment in fiscal year foreign currency gains and losses changes in foreign currency transaction gains and losses negatively impacted other income expense by million in fiscal year versus fiscal year we recognized a foreign currency loss of million in fiscal year from the translation of cash accounts at certain foreign subsidiaries denominated in currencies other than their functional currency 
as most foreign currencies strengthened against the us dollar throughout fiscal year  we recognized approximately million of foreign currency gains in fiscal year mostly related to the translation of us dollar denominated intercompany debt at our non us subsidiaries 
most of this non us dollar denominated intercompany debt was repaid by the first quarter of fiscal year changes in foreign currency transaction gains and losses contributed a positive million change in other income expense in fiscal year compared to fiscal year as previously mentioned  we recognized million of foreign currency gains in fiscal year the weakening of foreign currencies against the us dollar generated million of foreign currency losses in fiscal year provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in fiscal year was compared with in fiscal year this increase in the effective tax rate was primarily driven by the expiration of the research and development tax credit in fiscal year the effective tax rate in fiscal year was compared with in fiscal year this reduction was driven by a higher mix of taxable income in foreign operations with lower tax rates than in the us shares outstanding average diluted shares remained relatively flat in fiscal year compared with fiscal year average diluted shares climbed million due to an increase in the dilutive impact of our outstanding stock options 
this higher dilutive impact resulted from the higher average share price in fiscal year this increase in average diluted shares was offset by a million share reduction in average basic shares outstanding 
average basic shares declined from fiscal year due to our share repurchases in both and offset by additional shares issued from the exercise of stock options 
average diluted shares outstanding declined million in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this reduction was driven almost entirely by the lower dilution from our outstanding stock options and restricted share units 
average basic shares outstanding remained consistent from to segment analysis dollars in millions total total total net sales engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging operating profit engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging operating margin engine mobile filtration industrial environmental filtration packaging net sales  operating profit and operating margin increased for each of our segments in fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales for both the engine mobile filtration and packaging segments increased significantly from fiscal year the growth in our engine mobile filtration segment was due to stronger heavy duty engine filter demand in the us and continued growth internationally 
the growth in our packaging segment was a result of increased sales of our smokeless tobacco metal lids in addition to a no margin million equipment and tooling sale to one of our customers 
although we recognized only moderate net sales growth at our industrial environmental filtration segment  operating margin improved points to 
this improvement was the result of various cost efficiencies but mainly those from the restructuring at our hvac filter operations 
net sales  operating profit and operating margin declined for each of our segments in fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales were down approximately at both our engine mobile filtration and industrial environmental filtration segments and at our packaging segment 
in general  this reduction in net sales  due to a decline in global economic conditions  was the primary reason for the lower operating profit and margin at each of our segments 
engine mobile filtration segment dollars in millions v v change change change change net sales operating profit operating margin pt pt our engine mobile filtration segment primarily sells after market filters for heavy duty trucks and off highway vehicles  locomotives and automobiles 
the largest market in this segment includes engine filters  for heavy duty trucks  produced at our baldwin business unit 
fiscal year versus fiscal year the net sales increases for our engine mobile filtration segment for fiscal year compared with fiscal year are detailed in the following table dollars in millions net sales us sales foreign sales including export foreign exchange net increase the net increase in us sales for the engine mobile filtration segment in fiscal year as compared with fiscal year is detailed as follows dollars in millions heavy duty engine filters locomotive filters net increase in us sales our sales of heavy duty engine filters in the us have been positively influenced by continued strength in the us trucking industry 
through november  heavy duty truck tonnage in the us was approximately higher compared with the same period in in addition  truck tonnage continues to trend upwards as average us truck tonnage in our fiscal fourth quarter exceeded our fiscal third quarter by approximately 
our us sales of railroad filtration products have increased slightly  but we anticipate activity to improve in fiscal as an indicator of the recovery in us rail activity  through october approximately  freight cars have been removed from storage since the end of additional cars have been removed from storage for sixteen consecutive months 
net sales adjusted for changes in foreign currency outside the us increased million in fiscal year from fiscal year this net sales increase was spread throughout our diverse international markets 
however  approximately million of this increase in fiscal year was from sales in china which have been positively impacted by our continued market penetration in first fit heavy duty engine filter sales 
the increase in operating profit for the engine mobile filtration segment compared to fiscal year was driven by the increase in heavy duty engine filter sales 
for fiscal year  selling and administrative expenses were approximately million higher than fiscal year the increase in selling and administrative expenses was the result of higher payments under our company wide profit sharing program and incremental legal expenses 
we estimate that the change in average foreign exchange rates from fiscal year to fiscal year positively influenced the translated us dollar value of fiscal year operating profit by million 
fiscal year versus fiscal year the net sales decrease for our engine mobile filtration segment for fiscal year compared with fiscal year is detailed in the following table dollars in millions net sales us sales foreign sales including export foreign exchange net decrease the net decrease in us sales for the engine mobile filtration segment in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is detailed as follows dollars in millions heavy duty engine filters locomotive filters net decrease in us sales the million decline in us sales was the result of lower demand from our heavy duty truck and locomotive customers 
truck tonnage in the us declined approximately from fiscal year to fiscal year  and locomotive car loadings in north america declined approximately 
the million reduction in sales to customers outside the us was driven by an approximate million decline at our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
this subsidiary lost a major customer at the end of and was also significantly impacted by the downturn in the power generation market 
the remainder of the decrease in non us sales was spread throughout our remaining foreign subsidiaries 
each of our major foreign locations had lower net sales in compared with with the exception of our south africa subsidiary which was flat year over year 
operating profit for our engine mobile filtration segment declined million or from fiscal year to fiscal year in general  the million reduction in operating profit was primarily driven by the million reduction in net sales and the resulting under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs world wide 
the negative impact of this net sales reduction was offset in part by reduced material cost and a million reduction in selling and administrative expenses driven by headcount reductions and limits on discretionary spending such as travel and outside professional services 
the change in average foreign exchange rates from to negatively impacted the translated us dollar value of operating profit by approximately million 
industrial environmental filtration segment dollars in millions v v change change change change net sales operating profit operating margin pt pt our industrial environmental filtration segment sells a large variety of filtration products to various end markets 
included in this market are hvac filters  natural gas vessels and replacement filters  aviation fuel filters and filter systems  and other markets including oil drilling  aerospace  fibers and resins and dust collector systems 
fiscal year versus fiscal year the net sales increase for our industrial environmental filtration segment for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is detailed in the following table dollars in millions net sales us sales foreign sales including export foreign exchange net increase the net increase in us sales for the industrial environmental filtration segment in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is detailed as follows dollars in millions hvac filters m hvac filters retail trial hvac filters commercial and industrial filter sales through total filtration services tfs aerospace  oil drilling and other industrial filters natural gas vessels and aftermarket filters aviation vessels and aftermarket filters other net increase in us sales in the third quarter of fiscal year  we were informed by m that it would no longer be purchasing hvac filters from us 
accordingly  we had no hvac filter sales to m in fiscal year in fiscal year  we sold million of our high end purolator brand hvac residential filters to a large retail store chain on a trial basis 
these sales did not repeat in fiscal year  creating a negative variance in our year over year comparisons 
we continue to seek additional opportunities to penetrate the residential hvac filter retail market 
the remaining increase in hvac filter sales in the us in fiscal year was primarily due to the year over year improvement in general economic conditions driving growth in commercial and industrial applications 
the increase in us net sales in fiscal year at tfs was the result of increased filter sales to the automotive and other industrial markets including chemical  metals and power generation 
filter sales to the automotive industry increased million in fiscal year compared with fiscal year as the automotive industry began to recover from the economic downturn in these automotive industry sales were primarily air filters used in manufacturing and other facilities 
the increase in fiscal year us sales to the aerospace  oil drilling and other industrial markets was driven in part by additional parts manufacturer approvals pmas from commercial aerospace customers and as a result of improved general economic conditions which supported net sales increases notably in the wire mesh filter and other industrial markets 
net sales in the us natural gas market increased slightly in fiscal year compared with fiscal year due to an increase in replacement filter sales offset by a similar reduction in vessel sales 
the increase in replacement filter sales was driven by a focused effort to build our market share in this segment 
the reduction in natural gas vessel sales was due to the lower price of natural gas and the related decrease in construction of new natural gas pipelines in fiscal year compared with fiscal year the increase in us aviation net sales in fiscal year was primarily the result of a large military aviation aftermarket filter sale consummated in the third quarter of fiscal year the decline in foreign sales for fiscal year was driven by a reduction in european sales primarily in spain and germany 
the reduction in spain was caused by a reduction in military aviation orders  and the reduction in germany was caused by several large system orders consummated in fiscal year that did not repeat in fiscal year in addition  a decline in natural gas vessel sales in canada due to the lower price of natural gas contributed to the reduction in foreign sales in fiscal year these foreign sales reductions were partially offset by an increase in filter sales to the oil drilling market primarily in asia 
the increase in operating profit and margin at our industrial environmental filtration segment was the result of the continued improved operating results at our hvac filter operations including tfs where operating profit increased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year despite lower overall hvac filter sales in fiscal year primarily from the loss of m sales  operating profit increased due to the benefits of our restructuring program which was substantially completed in fiscal year  lower material costs driven by lower commodity prices and improved material efficiency and lower selling and administrative expenses 
driven by stronger sales  operating profit in our aerospace  oil drilling and other industrial markets increased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year the operating profit at the remaining industrial environmental filtration segment markets  including aviation and natural gas  increased in fiscal year compared with fiscal year the operating margin increase of points for fiscal year was primarily influenced by the restructuring efforts at our hvac operations  lower material costs and a higher mix of aftermarket filters which have higher operating margins than vessels sold in our natural gas  aviation and marine markets 
we estimate that the change in average foreign exchange rates from fiscal year to fiscal year positively impacted operating profit by million 
fiscal year versus fiscal year the net sales decrease for our industrial environmental filtration segment for fiscal year compared to fiscal year is detailed in the following table dollars in millions net sales us sales foreign sales including export foreign exchange net decrease the net decrease in us sales for the industrial environmental filtration segment in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is detailed as follows dollars in millions aerospace  oil drilling and other industrial filters filter sales through total filtration services tfs hvac filters m hvac filters commercial and industrial hvac filters retail trial natural gas vessels and aftermarket filters aviation vessels and aftermarket filters other net decrease in us sales the decrease in fiscal year us sales to the aerospace  oil drilling and other industrial markets was primarily driven by a million reduction in filter sales to the oil and gas industry as off shore drilling activity declined with lower oil prices 
the remaining decrease in sales to the aerospace and other industrial markets was driven by the general decline in economic activity 
the decrease in us net sales in fiscal year at tfs was primarily the result of lower filter sales to the automotive market  which declined million in fiscal year compared with fiscal year these filters were primarily air filters used in automotive manufacturing and other facilities 
the decrease in hvac filters was driven by a reduction in air filter sales to m 
we had supplied hvac filters to m for many years although our annual sales had been declining for years as m moved production into its mexican manufacturing facility 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  we were informed by m that it would no longer be purchasing hvac filters from us 
the lost sales in the fourth quarter in addition to generally lower demand from m in the prior three quarters contributed to the million reduction from as an offset to this reduction in us sales in fiscal year  we sold million of our high end purolator brand hvac residential filters to a large retail store chain on a trial basis 
sales of natural gas vessels and aftermarket filters increased slightly due to the carryover of strong vessel orders in the first half of fiscal year from the historically high natural gas prices in fiscal year in addition  we continued our focus on growing our market share in natural gas aftermarket filters 
the reduction in foreign sales from fiscal year to fiscal year was driven by a million decrease in foreign export sales of our natural gas vessels produced at our north american manufacturing facilities 
approximately million of this million decline was related to shipments to india  africa and the middle east which did not recur in the remainder of the decline in foreign sales was due to an approximate million reduction in dust collector sales in europe 
in general  the reduction in operating profit in fiscal year compared with fiscal year was driven by the significant reduction in net sales and the resulting under absorption of fixed manufacturing costs world wide  including a million operating profit decline at our oil drilling filtration business which was significantly impacted by reduced offshore drilling activity 
the negative impact of the significant sales decline was offset in part by a million reduction in selling and administrative expenses 
in addition  the near completion of our restructuring program at our hvac operations reduced fixed manufacturing costs by approximately million in fiscal year the change in average foreign exchange rates from fiscal year to fiscal year negatively impacted the translated us dollar value of operating profit by approximately million 
packaging segment dollars in millions v v change change change change net sales operating profit operating margin pt pt our packaging segment manufactures and markets consumer and industrial packaging products 
the increase in net sales at our packaging segment in fiscal year includes a no margin million equipment and tooling sale to one of our customers in the second quarter 
the remaining net sales increase for fiscal year was primarily the result of additional sales from smokeless tobacco packaging and decorated flat sheet metal 
operating profit in fiscal year increased from fiscal year primarily due to the incremental profit from the increase in net sales 
less than of sales in this segment are outside the us the decrease in net sales from fiscal year to fiscal year was driven by a million reduction in the confectionary  film  health and beauty and pharmaceutical markets offset in part by million increase in net sales from smokeless tobacco packaging and decorated flat sheet metal 
the reduction in operating profit from fiscal year to fiscal year was driven by the reduction in sales but was offset in part by savings resulting from cost initiatives to reduce direct labor and manufacturing overhead 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our financial position remains strong with adequate cash resources and sufficient borrowing capacity under our line of credit 
in the first quarter of  we entered into a five year multicurrency revolving credit agreement credit facility with a group of financial institutions under which we may borrow up to million under a selection of currencies and rate formulas 
we believe the financial institutions that are party to this arrangement have adequate capital resources and will be able to fund future borrowings under the credit facility 
at our election the interest rate is based upon either a defined base rate or the london interbank offered rate libor interest rate plus or minus applicable margins 
at the end of each fiscal year and  the libor interest rate on our credit facility including margin was 
at november  there were no amounts outstanding on the credit facility 
however  we had million outstanding on a million letter of credit subline 
accordingly  we had approximately million available for further borrowing at the end of fiscal year cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments increased million to million at the end of fiscal year from million at the end of fiscal year of the million of cash at year end  million was located at entities outside the us although we plan to use this cash at our us entities  if we repatriated this cash to the us  we could incur significant tax expense 
cash and cash equivalents are held by financial institutions throughout the world 
the company invests in financially strong institutions and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one institution 
we regularly review the credit worthiness of these institutions and believe our funds at these institutions are not at significant risk 
the current ratio of at the end of fiscal year was comparable with the current ratio of at the end of year end total long term debt of million at november  included million outstanding on industrial revenue bonds and million of other long term debt 
at the end of fiscal years and we were in compliance with all financial covenants as included in our credit facility 
we expect to be in compliance with these covenants in the foreseeable future 
the ratio of total debt to total capitalization defined as long term debt plus total shareholders equity was at the end of fiscal year compared to at the end of fiscal year we had million shares of common stock outstanding at the end of fiscal year compared to million outstanding at the end of fiscal year the million decrease in outstanding shares was driven by our repurchase of million shares in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year offset in part by the issuance of million shares in conjunction with incentive plans 
shareholders equity increased to million at the end of fiscal year from million at the end of fiscal year this million increase was driven by additional net earnings of million  stock and stock compensation expense pursuant to incentive plans of million and pension and other postretirement benefits adjustments of million offset by dividend payments of million  our repurchase of common stock of million  currency translation adjustments of million and changes in noncontrolling interest ownership and other of million 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million in fiscal year to million 
this increase was driven by a million increase in net earnings adjusted for non cash items and million of cash generated from changes in short term investments offset by million of additional cash required for additional working capital to support our higher net sales levels 
net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this million increase was driven by million of additional cash generated from changes in working capital offset by lower earnings adjusted for non cash items of million 
the million of additional cash generated from changes in working capital was significantly impacted by the million of cash generated from a reduction in accounts receivable which declined as a result of lower net sales 
this cash generated was offset in part by million of additional cash invested in short term investments 
our inventory levels did not decline significantly with lower net sales based upon our strategic decision to maintain high customer fill rates 
net cash used in investing activities declined million in fiscal year compared with fiscal year this reduction was primarily the result of a reduction in cash used for business acquisitions of million 
we used million of cash in fiscal year for several smaller acquisitions while we completed no acquisitions in fiscal year net cash used in investing activities decreased million to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year this decrease was driven by a million reduction in cash used for business acquisitions 
the million invested in business acquisitions in was primarily related to our acquisition of peco 
the million invested in business acquisitions in was driven by several smaller acquisitions 
in addition to reduced investment for business acquisitions  we used million less cash for additions to plant assets in fiscal year compared to fiscal year this reduction was primarily related to lower spending for the restructuring of our hvac operations of approximately million 
net cash used in financing activities decreased million in fiscal year compared with fiscal year the million cash used in financing activities in fiscal year was driven by payments of million on our credit facility  million for dividends and million for our repurchase of common stock 
these cash outflows were offset in part by million received for the issuance of stock pursuant to employee incentive plans 
the million cash used in financing activities in fiscal year was driven by payments of million on our credit facility  million for our repurchase of common stock  million for dividends and million for the acquisition of non controlling interests for several entities in china 
these cash outflows were offset by proceeds of million from the re issuance of an industrial revenue bond and million from the issuance of stock pursuant to employee incentive plans 
net cash used in financing activities increased million in fiscal year compared with fiscal year the million cash provided by financing activities in was driven by proceeds of million from our credit facility primarily to finance the peco acquisition and million from the issuance of stock pursuant to incentive plans 
these cash proceeds were offset by payments of million for the repurchase of stock  million for dividends and million for payments on an industrial revenue bond 
on december   the company acquired all of the outstanding equity interests in transweb  a privately owned manufacturer and supplier of media used in a variety of end market applications  including respirators and hvac filters 
the base purchase price to acquire transweb was approximately million  excluding cash acquired  plus a potential earn out payable to one of the former owners 
of the base purchase price  the company withheld million pending resolution of certain patent litigation described in item of this annual report  which funds may be used by the company in connection with the same 
the company paid the balance of the purchase price with available cash 
we believe that our current operations will continue to generate cash and that sufficient borrowings under the credit facility remain available to fund current operating needs  pay dividends  invest in the development of new products and filter media  fund planned capital expenditures and expansion of current facilities  provide for interest payments and required principal payments related to debt agreements  fund pension plan contributions and repurchase common stock 
we also continue to assess acquisition opportunities in related filtration businesses that would expand our market base  distribution coverage or product offerings 
any such acquisitions may affect operating cash flows and may require changes in our debt and capitalization 
in addition  capital market disruptions may affect the cost or availability of future borrowings 
we have no material long term purchase commitments 
the company enters into purchase obligations with suppliers on a short term basis in the normal course of business 
we will also continue to assess repurchases of our common stock 
in june  our board of directors authorized a million stock repurchase program of our common stock in the open market and through private transactions over a three year period 
this authorization replaced our previous million share repurchase program that expired in june during fiscal year  we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock for million 
during  we repurchased and retired million shares of our common stock for million 
at the end of fiscal year  there was approximately million available for repurchase under the current authorization 
future repurchases of our common stock may be made after considering cash flow requirements for internal growth  capital expenditures  acquisitions  interest rates and the market price of our common stock 
the following table summarizes our current fixed cash obligations as of the end of fiscal year for the years indicated payments due by period dollars in millions total less than year years years more than years pension plan and other post retirement contributions operating leases long term debt excluding line of credit interest on long term debt excluding line of credit payments for acquisitions investment in affiliate total anticipated payments pursuant to our pension plans and for other post retirement benefits are based upon the assumption that we make the minimum required contributions and also make additional contributions to maintain a funded percentage of at least for each plan 
future estimates of our pension plan contributions may change significantly depending upon the actual rate of return on plan assets  discount rates and regulatory requirements 
interest payments on our variable rate debt in the table above are determined based upon current interest rates as of the end of fiscal year and assume that no additional borrowings or payments will be made on our credit facility during the periods presented 
at the end of fiscal year  our liability for uncertain income tax provisions was million including interest and penalties 
due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash outflows associated with these liabilities  we were unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these remaining liabilities might be paid 
from time to time  we use derivative financial instruments to mitigate our exposure to certain market risks 
however  by using derivative financial instruments  we are exposed to credit risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty owes us  which creates credit risk 
we minimize this credit risk by entering into transactions with counterparties which we believe have the financial resources to meet their obligations 
we did not hold any derivative financial instruments at november  off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet arrangements relate to various operating leases as discussed in note h to the consolidated financial statements 
we had no variable interest entity or special purpose entity agreements during or other matters critical accounting estimates our critical accounting policies  including the assumptions and judgments underlying them  are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied in all material respects and address such matters as revenue recognition  depreciation methods  inventory valuation  asset impairment recognition  business combination accounting and pension and postretirement benefits 
these critical accounting policies may be affected by recent relevant accounting pronouncements discussed in the following section 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these critical accounting policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  we believe the estimates and judgments associated with the reported amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
the following lists the most critical accounting estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements which require us to use significant judgment and estimates of amounts that are inherently uncertain goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we annually review goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
these reviews of fair value involve judgment and estimates of discount rates  terminal values  transaction multiples and future cash flows for the reporting units that may be impacted by future sales and operating results for the reporting units  market conditions and worldwide economic conditions 
all goodwill and intangibles are allocated to the reporting unit component at the time of acquisition 
we have determined that the reporting unit components meet the criteria for aggregation into five reporting units 
these reporting units are aggregated based upon similar economic characteristics  nature of products and services  nature of production processes  type of customers and distribution methods 
in performing our impairment reviews  we estimated the fair values of the aggregated reporting units using a present value method that discounted future cash flows 
for our indefinite lived intangibles  we performed annual impairment tests using the relief from royalty method to determine the fair value of our trademarks and trade names 
we further analyzed various discount rates  transaction and capital market multiples and cash flows for aggregated reporting units to assess the reasonableness of our estimates and assumptions 
we believe our valuation techniques and assumptions are reasonable for this purpose 
we have not materially changed our methodology for valuing goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
based upon our analysis at november   the estimated fair value for each of our reporting units exceeded its carrying value by at least approximately 
the weighted average excess of fair value over carrying value of all our reporting units was approximately 
allowance for losses on accounts receivable allowances for losses on customer accounts receivable balances are estimated based on economic conditions in the industries to which we sell and on historical experience by evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss  fluctuations in amounts owed and current payment trends 
our concentration of risk is also monitored and at the end of fiscal year  the largest outstanding customer account balance was million and the five largest account balances totaled million 
the allowances provided are estimates that may be impacted by economic and market conditions which could have an effect on future allowance requirements and results of operations 
pensions our pension obligations are determined using estimates including those related to discount rates  asset values and changes in compensation 
the discount rate used for each plan was based on the citigroup pension discount curve 
the projected benefit payments in each year were discounted using the appropriate spot rate from the curve 
for each plan  a single discount rate was determined that produced the same total discounted value 
that rate  rounded to basis points  was the discount rate selected for the plan 
the discount rate used for the qualified plans for us employees was selected as the best estimate of the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled on the measurement date taking into account the nature and duration of the benefit obligations of the plan using high quality fixed income investments currently available rated aa or better and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the benefits 
the expected return on plan assets was determined based on historical long term investment returns as well as future expectations given target investment asset allocations and current economic conditions 
the rate of compensation increase represents the long term assumption for expected increases in salaries among continuing active participants accruing benefits under the qualified plan 
the mortality table for the qualified plans is determined based on the actuarial table that is most reflective of the expected mortality of the plan participants 
the mortality table adopted rp projected was developed for pension plans by a society of actuaries study 
the mortality table used for the nonqualified pension plan is specified by the plan agreement 
the assumptions are similarly determined for each pension obligation 
actual results and future obligations will vary based on changes in interest rates  stock and bond market valuations and employee compensation 
in  a reduction in the expected return on plan assets of would result in additional expense in fiscal of approximately million  while a reduction in the discount rate of would have resulted in additional expense of approximately million for our qualified defined benefit pension plans for us covered employees 
interest rates and pension plan valuations may vary significantly based on worldwide economic conditions and asset investment decisions 
the unrecognized net actuarial loss of million at year end is due primarily to prior changes in assumptions related to discount rates and expected compared to actual asset returns 
this actuarial loss will be recognized as pension expense in the future over the average remaining service period of the employees in the plans 
see note i to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we are required to estimate and record income taxes payable for each of the us and international jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing accounting treatment between tax and book which result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  accruals are also estimated for federal  state and international tax transactions for which deductibility is subject to interpretation 
taxes payable and the related deferred tax differences may be impacted by changes to tax laws  changes in tax rates and changes in taxable profits and losses 
reserves are also estimated for uncertain tax positions that are currently unresolved 
we routinely monitor the potential impact of such situations and believe that it is properly reserved 
recent market events current market conditions and economic events have significantly impacted the financial condition  liquidity and outlook for a wide range of companies  including many companies outside the financial services sectors 
we have considered the potential impact of such conditions and events as it relates to currently reported financial results of operations and liquidity  including consideration of the possible impact of other than temporary impairment  counterparty credit risk and hedge accounting 
we do not believe that  based on our current investment policies and contractual relationships  we are subject to greater risk from such factors than other companies of similar size and market breadth

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk is primarily related to the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency fluctuations 
in the normal course of business  we may also be exposed to various market risks that arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business related to items such as the cost of raw materials and changes in inflation 
certain contractual relationships with customers and vendors mitigate risks from changes in raw material costs and currency exchange rate changes that arise from normal purchasing and normal sales activities 
interest rates we are exposed to changes in interest rates  primarily due to our financing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt as well as cash  cash equivalents and certain short term  highly liquid investments 
interest rate fluctuations could affect earnings  cash flows or the fair value of our financial liabilities 
our debt obligations are primarily at variable rates and are denominated in us dollars 
to minimize the long term costs of borrowing  we manage our interest rate risk by monitoring trends in rates as a basis for determining whether to enter into fixed rate or variable rate agreements and the duration of such agreements 
we mitigated our interest rate risk on our borrowing under our revolving line of credit in by entering into a fixed interest rate swap agreement at the beginning of which fixed our interest until january interest rate risk is not expected to be significant to us in fiscal year as amounts outstanding on our long term debt agreements are more than offset by cash and cash equivalents 
the primary interest rate risk will be driven by our return on cash and cash equivalents 
based upon the million in cash and cash equivalents at november   a change in interest rates could impact annual interest income by approximately million 
this change in interest income would increase or decrease as cash and cash equivalents increase or decrease 
foreign currency since we operate through subsidiaries in several countries around the world  our reported financial results of operations  including the reported value of assets and liabilities  are exposed to translation risk when the financial statements of our subsidiaries  as stated in their functional currencies  are translated into the us dollar 
the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries outside the us are translated at period end rates of exchange for each reporting period 
earnings and cash flow statements are translated at weighted average rates of exchange 
although these translation changes have no immediate cash impact  the translation changes may impact the overall value of net assets 
we are also exposed to transaction risk from changes in foreign currency rates through sales and purchasing transactions when we sell products in functional currencies different from the currency in which product and manufacturing costs were incurred 
the functional currencies of our worldwide facilities primarily include the us dollar  the euro  the british pound sterling  the canadian dollar  the chinese yuan renminbi  the malaysian ringgit and the mexican peso 
as these currencies fluctuate against each other  and other currencies  we are exposed to foreign currency transaction risk on sales and purchasing transactions 
currency exchange rates vary daily and often one currency strengthens against the us dollar while another currency weakens 
because of the complex interrelationship of the worldwide supply chains and distribution channels  it is difficult to quantify the impact of a particular change in exchange rates 
however  we estimate that if the us dollar strengthened or weakened relative to the currencies where our foreign income and cash flows are derived the effect on the consolidated results of operations could be to per diluted share 
we estimate that the effect of changes in the average foreign currency translation rates in compared to positively impacted our operating profit by approximately million in as a result of continued foreign sales and business activities  we continue to evaluate derivative financial instruments  including forwards  swaps and purchased options  to manage foreign currency exchange rate changes in the future 
we did not hold any such derivatives during  or related to foreign currency exchange
