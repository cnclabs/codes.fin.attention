please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included in this report for a discussion of facilities that we have sold or identified for disposal in recent years 
our results of operations  net of income taxes  of our previously sold facilities and those identified for disposal are reflected as discontinued operations 

table of contents in september  we committed to plans to sell doctors hospital of opelousas opelousas  a bed facility located in opelousas  louisiana  and starke memorial hospital starke  a bed facility located in knox  indiana 
effective may   we sold opelousas for million  including working capital and effective july   we sold starke for million  including working capital 
in connection with our disposals of opelousas and starke  we recognized a loss on sale of hospitals  net of income tax benefits  of million during the year ended december  in march  we signed a letter of intent with a third party to terminate its existing lease agreement and transfer substantially all of the operating assets and net working capital of colorado river medical center colorado river  a bed facility located in needles  california 
effective april   we terminated our lease agreement and transferred substantially all of the operating assets and working capital to a third party 
in connection with our disposal of colorado river  we recognized a loss on sale of hospitals  net of income tax benefits  of million during the year ended december  during the year ended december  we recognized total impairment charges  net of taxes of million 
these impairment charges included a million charge for opelousas and a million charge for starke 
these charges were partially offset by a reversal of the previously recognized impairment charge of million for colorado river 
we allocated goodwill to each of these facilities based on the ratio of its estimated fair value to our estimated fair value 
liquidity and capital resources liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by our operations and our debt borrowings 
we believe that our internally generated cash flows and the amounts available under our debt agreements will be adequate to service existing debt  finance internal growth and fund capital expenditures and certain small to mid size hospital acquisitions 
the following table presents summarized cash flow information for the years ended december   and in millions

net cash flows provided by continuing operations less purchase of property and equipment free operating cash flow acquisitions  net of cash acquired proceeds from borrowings payments on borrowings repurchases of common stock payment of debt issue costs proceeds from exercise of stock options distributions to noncontrolling interests  net of proceeds other cash flows from operations used in discontinued operations cash flows provided by used in investing activities by discontinued operations net increase in cash and cash equivalents the non gaap metric of free operating cash flow is an important liquidity measure for us 
our computation of free operating cash flow consists of net cash flows provided by continuing operations less cash flows used for the purchase of property and equipment 

table of contents our cash flows for the year ended december  were positively impacted by lower tax payments as a result of the completion of our method change applications filed with the irs during the third quarter  as discussed in note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition  our cash flows for the year ended december  were positively impacted by an increase in our income from continuing operations and the timing and amount of cash payments made for interest and salaries and benefits 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in our collection of accounts receivable  as a larger percentage of our revenues were incurred later in the third and fourth quarters as compared to the prior year 
our cash flows provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended december  were positively impacted by an increase in our income from continuing operations  a decrease in cash paid for interest and an increase in both up front cash collections and collections related to insured receivables as compared to the prior year 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in cash paid for income taxes for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year 
we believe that free operating cash flow is useful to investors and management as a measure of the ability of our business to generate cash and to repay and incur additional debt 
computations of free operating cash flow may differ from company to company 
therefore  free operating cash flow should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
capital expenditures we have also made significant  targeted investments at our hospitals to add new technologies  modernize facilities and expand the services available 
these investments should assist in our efforts to attract and retain physicians  to offset outmigration of patients and to make our hospitals more desirable to our employees and potential patients

capital projects routine information systems depreciation expense ratio of capital expenditures to depreciation expense we have a formal and intensive review procedure for the authorization of capital expenditures 
the most important financial measure of acceptability for a discretionary capital project is whether its projected discounted cash flow return on investment exceeds our projected cost of capital for that project 
we expect to continue to invest in information systems  modern technologies  emergency room and operating room expansions  the construction of medical office buildings for physician expansion and the reconfiguration of the flow of patient care 
throughout  we have experienced a significant increase in our spending related to information systems as the result of various initiatives and requirements  including compliance with the hitech act 
we anticipate increasing our spending related to information systems during as compared to and prior years 
additionally  as discussed in note and note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we have committed to invest an additional million in capital expenditures and improvements in highpoint over the next years and approximately million to build and equip a new hospital to replace the current hospital facility at clark over the next months

interest rate swap we have an interest rate swap agreement with citibank as counterparty that requires us to make quarterly fixed rate payments to citibank calculated on a notional amount of million as of december  at an annual fixed rate of while citibank is obligated to make quarterly floating payments to us based on the three month libor on the same referenced notional amount 
we have designated our interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge instrument  which is recorded in our consolidated balance sheets at its fair value in accordance with asc  derivatives and hedging asc  based on the amount at which it could be settled  which is referred to in asc as the exit price 
the exit price is based upon observable market assumptions and appropriate valuation adjustments for credit risk 
we have categorized our interest rate swap as level in accordance with asc please refer to note to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a further discussion of our interest rate swap agreement 
liquidity and capital resources outlook we expect to increase our level of spending for capital expenditures in as compared to we have large projects in process at a number of our facilities 
we are reconfiguring some of our hospitals to more effectively accommodate patient services  restructuring existing surgical capacity in some of our hospitals to permit additional patient volume and a greater variety of services  and implementing various information system initiatives in our efforts to comply with the hitech act 
for the year ended december   we spent million on information systems 
we anticipate spending in excess of million on information systems in at december   we had uncompleted projects with an estimated additional cost to complete and equip of approximately million 
we anticipate funding these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities  available cash and borrowings available under our credit agreement 
our business strategy contemplates the selective acquisition of additional hospitals and other healthcare service providers  and we regularly review potential acquisitions 
these acquisitions may  however  require additional financing 
we regularly evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain credit agreements from lenders or restructure our long term debt or equity for strategic reasons or to further strengthen our financial position 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
in connection with our acquisition of highpoint  we have committed to invest million in capital expenditures and improvements over the next years 
additionally  in connection with our acquisition of clark  we have committed to spend an additional approximate million to build and equip a new hospital to replace the current hospital facility over the next months 
we believe that cash generated from our operations and borrowings available under our credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs  the purchase prices for any potential facility acquisitions  planned capital expenditures and other expected operating needs over the next twelve months and into the foreseeable future prior to the maturity dates of our outstanding debt 

table of contents contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations  which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed

a included in long term debt obligations are principal and interest owed on our outstanding debt obligations  giving consideration to our interest rate swap 
these obligations are explained further in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we used the effective interest rate at december  for our million outstanding term b loans to estimate interest payments on this variable rate debt instrument 
the maturity date of the million term b loans is contingent upon refinancing our outstanding notes beyond their current maturity date of may  in the event we do not refinance our notes  the extended portion of the term b loans mature on february  for purposes of the above table  we assumed that we would not refinance our notes beyond their current maturity date and the million term b loans would mature on february  our interest rate swap requires us to make quarterly interest payments at an annual fixed rate of while the counterparty is obligated to make quarterly floating payments to us based on the three month libor on a decreasing notional amount 
our calculation for long term debt obligations includes an estimate for the net result of these payments between us and the counterparty using the difference between our required annual fixed rate of and the three month libor in effect as of december  of based on the effective notional amounts for the indicated period 
holders of our million outstanding debentures may require us to purchase for cash some or all of the debentures on february   february   and february  for purposes of the above table  we assumed that our debentures would be outstanding during the entire term  which ends on august  these amounts exclude our unamortized convertible debt discounts and related non cash amortization 
b this reflects our future minimum operating lease payments 
we enter into operating leases in the normal course of business 
substantially all of our operating lease agreements have fixed payment terms based on the passage of time 
some lease agreements provide us with the option to renew the lease 
our future operating lease obligations would change if we exercised these renewal options and if we entered into additional operating lease agreements 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information regarding our operating leases 
c our reserves for self insurance claims and other liabilities balance was million and our long term income tax liability balance was million in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the reserves for self insurance claims and other liabilities balance included the million long term portion of our reserves for self insurance claims and million related to other long term liabilities 
in addition to the long term potion of our reserves for self insurance claims of million  the above table includes the current portion of our reserves for self insurance claims of million 
we have excluded the million long term income tax liability because of the uncertainty of the dollar amounts to be ultimately paid as well as the timing of such amounts

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been made could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm  and they both have reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to our critical accounting estimates 
our critical accounting estimates include the following areas revenue recognition allowance for contractual discounts  allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for doubtful accounts  goodwill impairment analysis  reserves for self insurance claims  accounting for stock based compensation  and accounting for income taxes 
the following discussion of critical accounting estimates is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies that require estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  the estimates discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and our financial condition 
the discussion that follows presents information about our critical accounting estimates  as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate 
revenue recognition allowance for contractual discounts we recognize revenues in the period in which services are provided 
accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs  such as medicare and medicaid  and other third party payors such as hmos  ppos and other private insurers  are generally less than our established billing rates 
accordingly  our gross revenues and accounts receivable are reduced to net realizable value through an allowance for contractual discounts 
approximately  and of our revenues during the years ended december   and  respectively  relate to discounted charges  which were comprised of the following sources as a percentage of total revenues

medicare medicaid hmos  ppos and other private insurers revenues are recorded at estimated net amounts due from patients  third party payors and others for healthcare services provided 
for certain payors  such as medicare  medicaid  as well as some managed care payors with which we have contractual arrangements  the contractual allowances are calculated by computerized logging systems based on defined payment terms 
for other payors  the contractual allowances 
table of contents are determined based on historical data by insurance plan 
all contractual adjustments  regardless of type of payor or method of calculation  are reviewed and compared to actual experience 
we monitor our processes for calculating contractual allowances through review of payment discrepancy reports for logged payors  analysis of historical contractual allowance trends based on actual claims paid by hmos  ppos and other private insurers  review of contractual allowance information reflecting current contract terms  consideration and analysis of changes in charge rates and payor mix reimbursement levels  and other issues that may impact contractual allowances 
medicare and medicaid the majority of services performed on medicare and medicaid patients are reimbursed at predetermined reimbursement rates 
the differences between the established billing rates ie  gross charges and the predetermined reimbursement rates are recorded as contractual discounts and deducted from gross charges 
under the medicaid program s prospective reimbursement systems  there is no adjustment or settlement of the difference between the actual cost to provide the service and the predetermined reimbursement rates 
discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues are estimated based on historical and current factors and are adjusted in future periods when settlements of filed cost reports are received 
final settlements under these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third party intermediaries  which can take several years to resolve completely 
adjustments related to final settlements increased our revenues by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
because the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to change  the estimates of contractual discounts we record could change by material amounts 
a significant increase in our estimate of contractual discounts for medicare and medicaid would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and future access to capital 
hmos  ppos and other private insurers amounts we receive for the treatment of patients covered by hmos  ppos and other private insurers collectively managed care plans are generally less than our established billing rates 
we include contractual allowances as a reduction to revenues in our consolidated financial statements based on payor specific identification and payor specific factors for rate increases and denials 
for most managed care plans  estimated contractual allowances are adjusted to actual contractual allowances as cash is received and claims are reconciled 
if our overall estimated contractual discount percentage on our managed care program revenues for the year ended december  were changed by  our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately million  or diluted earnings per share of 
this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate the amount expected to be received based on payor contract provisions  historical collection data as well as other factors and requires a high degree of judgment 
it is impacted by changes in managed care contracts and other related factors 
a significant increase in our estimate of contractual discounts for managed care plans would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and future access to capital 
allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for doubtful accounts accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables is critical to our results of operations and cash flows 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to 
table of contents reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the primary uncertainty lies with uninsured patient receivables and deductibles  co payments or other amounts due from individual patients 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  included in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
our provision for doubtful accounts  included in our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the largest component of our allowance for doubtful accounts relates to accounts for which patients are responsible  which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts or self pay accounts 
these accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles payable by insured patients 
in general  we attempt to collect deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to the time of service for non emergency care 
if we do not collect these patient responsibility accounts prior to the delivery of care  the accounts are handled through our billing and collections processes 
the approximate amounts and percentages of billed insured and uninsured including self pay  co payments  deductibles and medicaid pending gross accounts receivable prior to allowance for contractual discounts and allowance for doubtful accounts in summarized aging categories are as follows for the periods presented in millions

december  insured receivables uninsured receivables combined amount percent of receivables amount percent of receivables amount percent of receivables to days to days to days over we verify each patient s insurance coverage as early as possible before a scheduled admission or procedure  including with respect to eligibility  benefits and authorization pre certification requirements  in order to notify patients of the amounts for which they will be responsible 
we attempt to verify insurance coverage within a reasonable amount of time for all emergency room visits and urgent admissions in compliance with emtala 
in general  we perform the following steps in collecting accounts receivable if possible  cash collection of deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to or at the time service is provided  billing and follow up with third party payors  collection calls  utilization of collection agencies  and if collection efforts are unsuccessful  write off of the accounts 

table of contents our policy is to write off accounts after all collection efforts have failed  which is generally one year after the date of discharge of the patient 
patient responsibility accounts represent the majority of our write offs 
all of our hospitals retain third party collection agencies for billing and collection of delinquent accounts 
at most of our hospitals  more than one collection agency is used to promote competition and improve performance results 
the selection of collection agencies and the timing of referral of an account to a collection agency vary among our hospitals 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts utilizing a number of analytical tools and benchmarks 
no single statistic or measurement alone determines the adequacy of the allowance 
specifically  we monitor the revenue trends by payor classification on a month by month basis along with the composition of our accounts receivable agings 
this review is focused primarily on trends in self pay revenues  accounts receivable  co payment receivables  historic payment patterns and other factors such as revenue days in accounts receivable 
the process of determining our allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to estimate uncollectible self pay accounts 
our estimate of uncollectible self pay accounts is primarily based on our collection history  adjusted for anticipated changes in collection trends  if significant 
our estimate may be impacted by changes in regional economic conditions  business office operations  payor mix and trends in federal or state governmental healthcare coverage or other third party payors 
if the actual self pay collection percentage would change by from our estimated self pay collection percentage for the year ended december   our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately million  or diluted earnings per share of  and our net accounts receivable would change by million at december  the resulting change in this analytical tool is considered to be a reasonably likely change that would affect our overall assessment of this critical accounting estimate 
goodwill impairment analysis goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses 
our goodwill included in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and was  and  million  respectively 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed rollforward of our goodwill 
in accordance with asc  intangibles goodwill and other asc goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed by us at least annually for impairment 
our business comprises a single operating reporting unit for impairment test purposes 
for the purposes of these analyses  our estimate of fair value are based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of us based on our future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of us based on comparable market prices 
our estimate of future discounted cash flows is based on assumptions and projections we believe to be currently reasonable and supportable 
our assumptions take into account revenue and expense growth rates  patient volumes  changes in payor mix  and changes in legislation and other payor payment patterns 
if we determine the carrying value of goodwill is impaired  or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value  then we reduce the carrying value  including any allocated goodwill  to fair value 
during the years ended december  and  we performed our annual impairment tests as of october  and  and did not incur an impairment charge 
during the year ended december   as a result of economic events and the decline in our stock price  we performed goodwill impairment testing as of september  and december  we determined that no goodwill impairment charge was required as a result of either analysis and have continued to monitor the relationship of our fair value to our book value as economic events and changes to our stock price occur 
if actual future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in the future 
reserves for self insurance claims we are subject to potential professional liability claims  employee workers compensation claims and other claims 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  we maintain insurance for individual professional liability claims and employee workers compensation claims exceeding a self insured retention level 
for all claims made after april   our self insured retention level is million per claim 
for claims made before 
table of contents april   our self insured retention level ranges from million per claim to million per claim 
our self insured retention level is evaluated annually as a part of our insurance program s renewal process 
additionally  as of december   our self insured retention level for workers compensation claims is million per claim in all states in which we operate except for wyoming 
we participate in a state specific program in wyoming for our workers compensation claims arising in this state 
each year  we obtain quotes from various insurers with respect to the cost of obtaining insurance coverage 
we compare these quotes to our most recent actuarially determined estimates of losses at various self insured retention levels 
accordingly  changes in insurance costs affect the self insured retention level we choose each year 
as insurance costs have decreased in recent years  we have reduced our self insured retention levels 
our reserves for self insurance claims reflects the current estimate of all outstanding losses  including incurred but not reported losses  based upon actuarial calculations as of the balance sheet date 
the loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future based upon updated facts and circumstances 
our expense for self insurance claims coverage each year includes the actuarially determined estimate of losses for the current year  including claims incurred but not reported  the change in the estimate of losses for prior years based upon actual claims development experience as compared to prior actuarial projections  the insurance premiums for losses in excess of our self insured retention levels  the administrative costs of the insurance program  and interest expense related to the discounted portion of the liability 
our reserves for professional liability claims are based upon quarterly actuarial calculations 
our reserves for employee worker s compensation claims are based upon semiannual actuarial calculations 
our reserve calculations consider historical claims data  demographic considerations  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions  which are discounted to present value 
we have discounted our reserves for self insured claims to their present value using a discount rate of  and at december   and  respectively 
as a result of the decreases in our applied discount rate our self insurance claims expense increased by approximately million  million and million which decreased our net income by approximately million  million and million and decreased our diluted earnings per share by  and during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we select a discount rate by considering a risk free interest rate that corresponds to the period when the self insured claims are incurred and projected to be paid

table of contents as of december  and  less than of our reserves for self insured claims represents reserves for settled and unpaid claims 
our average lag time between the settlement and payment of a self insured claim ranges from to weeks 
our estimated reserves for self insured claims will be significantly affected if current and future claims differ from historical trends 
while we monitor reported claims closely and consider potential outcomes when determining our reserves for self insured claims  the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes complicates the estimation process 
in addition  certain states have passed varying forms of tort reform which attempt to limit the amount of awards 
if such laws are passed in the states where our hospitals are located  our loss estimates could decrease 
our estimate of reserves for self insured claims are based upon actuarial calculations and are significantly influenced by key assumptions and other factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to historical paid claims  trending of loss development factors  trends in the frequency and severity of claims  which can differ significantly by jurisdiction as a result of the legislative and judicial climate in such jurisdictions  coverage limits of third party insurance and actuarial determined statistical confidence levels 
given the number of assumptions and characteristics of each assumption considered in establishing the reserves for self insured claims  it is difficult to compute the individual financial impact of each assumption or groups of assumptions 
some of the assumptions are dependent upon the quantitative measurement of other assumptions  and therefore are not accurately evaluated in isolation 
for example  a change in the frequency of claims assumption is also affected by the estimated severity of these claims resulting in an inability to properly isolate and quantify the impact of a change in this assumption 
professional and general liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often as long as five years or more  while workers compensation claims are typically resolved in one to two years 
our reserves for self insured claims are comprised of estimated indemnity and expense payments related to reported events and incurred but not reported events as of the end of the period 
we have the ability to reliably determine the amount and timing of payments based on sufficient history of our claims development  the use of external actuarial expertise and our rigorous review process 
actuarial payment patterns are based on our individual hospital historical data both prior to and after our inception in the processes  performed by both external actuaries and our management  enable us to reliably determine the amount of our ultimate losses as well as the timing of the loss settlements such that discounting of the reserves for self insured claims is appropriate 
given the number of factors considered in establishing the reserves for self insured claims  it is neither practical nor meaningful to isolate a particular assumption or parameter of the process and calculate the impact of changing that single item 
ultimately  from an actuarial standpoint  the sensitivity in the estimates of reserves for self insured claims is reflected in the various actuarial confidence levels 
our best estimate of our reserves for self insured claims utilizes a statistical confidence level that is 
higher statistical confidence levels  while not representative of our best estimate  reflect reasonably likely outcomes upon the ultimate resolution of related claims 
using a higher statistical confidence level would increase the estimated reserves for self insured claims 
changes in our estimates of reserves for self insured claims are non cash charges and accordingly  do not impact our liquidity or capital resources 
the assumptions included in the table below are presented for the sensitivity analysis in millions

table of contents the combination of changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of judgment  and such estimates require periodic revision 
as a result of the variety of factors that must be considered  there is a risk that actual incurred losses may develop differently from estimates 
during the year ended december   the results of our quarterly and semi annually completed actuarial calculations resulted in a decrease in our self insurance claims expense by million  which increased our net income by approximately million  or per diluted share 
the results of our quarterly and semi annually completed actuarial calculations increased our self insured claims expense by million and million  which decreased our net income by approximately million and million  or and per diluted share  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
accounting for stock based compensation we issue stock based awards  including stock options and other stock based awards nonvested stock  restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance shares and deferred stock units to certain officers  employees and non employee directors in accordance with our various stockholder approved stock based compensation plans 
we account for our stock based awards in accordance with the provisions of asc  compensation stock compensation asc and accordingly recognize compensation expense over each of the stock based award s requisite service period based on the estimated grant date fair value 
our stock based compensation from continuing operations  included in our consolidated results of operations  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the fair value of other stock based awards is determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the day prior to the grant date 
stock based compensation expense for our other stock based awards is recorded equally over the vesting periods of such awards generally ranging from six months to three years 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the hull white ii valuation model hw ii lattice option valuation model and a single option award approach 
we use the hw ii because it considers characteristics of fair value option pricing  such as an option s contractual term and the probability of exercise before the end of the contractual term 
in addition  the complications surrounding the expected term of an option are material  as indicated in asc given our reasonably large pool of unexercised options  we believe a lattice model that specifically addresses this fact and models a full term of exercises is the most appropriate and reliable means of valuing our stock options 
we are amortizing the fair value on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are the vesting periods of three years 
the stock options vest on each grant anniversary date over three years of continued employment 
the following table shows the weighted average assumptions we used to develop the fair value estimates under our hw ii option valuation model and the resulting estimates of weighted average fair value per share of stock options granted during the years ended december   and

expected volatility risk free interest rate range expected dividends average expected term years fair value per share of stock options granted population stratification in accordance with asc  a company should aggregate individual awards into relatively homogeneous groups with respect to exercise and post vesting employment behaviors for the purpose of refining the expected term assumption  regardless of the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value 
in addition  asc indicates that a company may generally make a reasonable fair value estimate with as few as one or two groupings 
we have determined that a single employee population group is appropriate based on an analysis of our historical exercise patterns 

table of contents expected volatility volatility is a measure of the tendency of investment returns to vary around a long term average rate 
historical volatility is an appropriate starting point for setting this assumption in accordance with asc according to asc  companies should also consider how future experience may differ from the past 
this may require using other factors to adjust historical volatility  such as implied volatility  peer group volatility and the range and mean reversion of volatility estimates over various historical periods 
asc acknowledges that there is likely to be a range of reasonable estimates for volatility 
in addition  asc requires that if a best estimate cannot be made  management should use the mid point in the range of reasonable estimates for volatility 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on both historical volatility and implied volatility from traded options of our common stock  consistent with asc risk free interest rate lattice models require risk free interest rates for all potential times of exercise obtained by using a grant date yield curve 
a lattice model would  therefore  require the yield curve for the entire time period during which employees might exercise their options 
we base the risk free rate on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on united states treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
expected dividends we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we use an expected dividend yield of zero 
pre vesting forfeitures pre vesting forfeitures do not affect the fair value calculation  but they affect the expense calculation 
asc requires us to estimate pre vesting forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
we apply a dynamic forfeiture rate methodology over the vesting period of the award 
the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology incorporates the lapse of time into the resulting expense calculation and results in a forfeiture rate that diminishes as the granted awards approach its vest date 
accordingly  the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology results in a more consistent stock compensation expense calculation over the vesting period of the award 
post vesting cancellations post vesting cancellations include vested options that are cancelled  exercised or expire unexercised 
lattice models treat post vesting cancellations and voluntary early exercise behavior as two separate assumptions 
we use historical data to estimate post vesting cancellations 
expected term asc calls for an extinguishment calculation  dependent upon how long a granted option remains outstanding before it is fully extinguished 
while extinguishment may result from exercise  it can also result from post vesting cancellation or expiration at the contractual term 
expected term is an output in lattice models so we do not have to determine this amount 
the fair value calculations of our stock option grants are affected by assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based upon the facts and circumstances at the time of grant 
changes in our volatility estimates can materially affect the fair values of our stock option grants 
if our estimated weighted average volatility for the year ended december  were higher  our after tax income from continuing operations would decrease by approximately million  or approximately per diluted share 

table of contents accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets generally represent items that will result in a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not probable  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance  we must include an expense as part of the income tax provision in our results of operations 
our deferred tax asset balances in our consolidated balance sheets were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of certain tax related contingencies 
we establish accruals when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to tax contingencies and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we adjust the accruals related to tax contingencies as part of our provision for income taxes in our results of operations based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as progress of a tax audit  development of industry related examination issues  as well as legislative  regulatory or judicial developments 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and resolved 
the first step in determining the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is identifying reporting jurisdictions where we have a history of tax and operating losses or are projected to have losses in future periods as a result of changes in operational performance 
we then determine if a valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets for that reporting jurisdiction 
the second step is to determine the amount of the valuation allowance 
we will generally establish a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities related to the jurisdiction identified in step one of the analysis 
in certain cases  we may not reduce the valuation allowance by the amount of the deferred tax liabilities depending on the nature and timing of future taxable income attributable to deferred tax liabilities 
in assessing tax contingencies  we apply the provisions of asc  income taxes 
we apply the recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and follow the guidance on various matters such as derecognition  interest  penalties and disclosure 
we classify interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 
during each reporting period  we assess the facts and circumstances related to recorded tax contingencies 
if tax contingencies are no longer deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances  the contingency is reflected as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the current period 
our deferred tax liabilities exceeded our deferred tax assets by million as of december   excluding the impact of valuation allowances 
historically  we have produced federal taxable income 
therefore  we believe that the likelihood of not realizing the federal tax benefit of our deferred tax assets is remote 
however  we do have subsidiaries with a history of tax losses in certain state jurisdictions and  based upon those historical tax losses  we assumed that the subsidiaries would not be profitable in the future for those states tax purposes 
if our assertion regarding the future profitability of those subsidiaries was incorrect  then our deferred tax assets would be understated by the amount of the valuation allowance of million at december  the internal revenue service irs may propose adjustments for items we have failed to identify as tax contingencies 
if the irs were to propose and sustain assessments equal to of our taxable income for  we would incur approximately million of additional tax payments for plus interest and penalties  if applicable 

table of contents segment reporting we have five operating divisions as of december  each of these operating divisions has similar economic characteristics consisting of acute care hospitals in non urban communities 
we realign these operating divisions frequently based upon changing circumstances  including acquisition and divestiture activity 
we consider these operating divisions as one operating segment  healthcare services  for segment reporting purposes and for goodwill impairment testing in accordance with asc  segment reporting asc  and asc we have determined that our five operating divisions comprise one segment because of their similar economic characteristics in accordance with asc for the following reasons the treatment of patients in a hospital setting is the only material source of revenues for each of our five operating divisions  the healthcare services provided by each of our operating divisions are generally the same  the healthcare services provided by each of our operating divisions are generally provided to similar types of patients  which is patients in a hospital setting  the healthcare services are primarily provided by the direction of affiliated or employed physicians and by the nurses  lab and radiology technicians  and others employed or contracted at each of our hospitals  and the healthcare regulatory environment is generally similar for each of our five operating divisions 
additionally  as discussed in asc  we determined that our five operating divisions comprise one reporting unit because of their similar economic characteristics in each of the following areas the way we manage our operations and extent to which our acquired facilities are integrated into our existing operations as a single reporting unit  our goodwill is recoverable from the collective operations of our five operating divisions and not individually from one single operating division  our operating divisions are frequently realigned based upon changing circumstances  including acquisition and divestiture activity  and because of the collective size of our five operating divisions  each division benefits from its participation in a group purchasing organization 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages in marketplaces occur 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
private insurers pass along their rising costs in the form of lower reimbursement to us 
our ability to pass on these increased costs in increased rates is limited because of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and the fact that the majority of our revenues are fee based 
accordingly  inflationary pressures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the following discussion relates to our exposure to market risk based on changes in interest rates outstanding debt we have an interest rate swap to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
the interest rate swap converts a portion of our indebtedness to a fixed rate with a notional amount of million at december  at an annual fixed rate of 
accordingly  we are slightly exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates 
the notional amount of the swap agreement represents a balance used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and is not an asset or liability 
any market risk or opportunity 
table of contents associated with this swap agreement is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
our interest rate swap agreement exposes us to credit risk in the event of non performance by citibank 
however  we do not anticipate non performance by citibank 
as of december   we had outstanding debt  excluding million of unamortized discounts on our convertible debt instruments  of  million   or million  of which was subject to variable rates of interest

we do not hold direct investments in auction rate securities  collateralized debt obligations  structured investment vehicles or mortgage backed securities 
we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash at december  as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   if any  is low
