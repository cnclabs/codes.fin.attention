item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview host inc operates as a self managed and self administered reit 
host inc is the sole general partner of host lp and holds of its partnership interests 
host lp is a limited partnership operating through an umbrella partnership structure 
as of february   we own hotels  primarily consisting of luxury and upper upscale properties 
host inc is the largest lodging reit in nareit s composite index 
a reit is a legal entity that owns real estate assets and  through payments of dividends to stockholders  is permitted to reduce or eliminate federal income taxes at the corporate level 
our hotels are operated under brand names that are among the most respected and widely recognized in the lodging industry 
the majority of our properties are luxury and upper upscale that are located in central business districts of major cities  near airports and in resort conference destinations that benefit from significant barriers to entry by competitors 
in  approximately of our revenues were generated by our urban and resort conference hotels 
while our hotels are still subject to competitive pressures  we believe this strategy should allow us to achieve room rate and occupancy premiums in excess of those of our competitors 
we seek to maximize the value of our portfolio through aggressive asset management by assisting the managers of our hotels in optimizing property operations and by completing strategic capital improvements 
our customers the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient business  group business and contract business 
the table below details the percentage of our room sales for each group transient business group business contract business similar to the majority of the lodging industry  we further categorize business within these categories based on characteristics they have in common as follows transient business broadly represents individual business or leisure travelers 
business travelers make up the majority of transient demand at our hotels 
therefore  we will be more significantly affected by trends in business travel versus leisure demand 
the four key subcategories of the transient business group are premium sometimes referred to as rack rate  this rate is typically applied to rooms booked close to arrival during high demand periods and is the highest rate category available 
room rates will fluctuate depending on anticipated demand levels eg seasonality and weekday vs 
weekend stays 
corporate this is the benchmark rate that a hotel publishes and offers to the general public 
it is typically the second highest category and is for travelers that do not have access to negotiated or discount rates 
special corporate this is a negotiated rate offered to companies and organizations that provide significant levels of room night demand to the hotel or to hotel brands generally 
these rates are typically negotiated annually at a discount to the anticipated corporate rate 
discount this encompasses all discount programs  such as aaa and aarp discounts  government per diem  rooms booked through wholesale channels  frequent guest program redemptions  and promotional rates and packages offered by a hotel 

table of contents group business represents clusters of guestrooms booked together  usually with a minimum of rooms 
examples include a company training session or a social event such as a family reunion 
the three key sub categories of the group business category are association group business related to national and regional association meetings and conventions 
corporate group business related to corporate meetings eg  product launches  training programs  contract negotiations  and presentations 
other group business predominately related to social  military  education  religious  fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams  otherwise known as smerf business 
the final category is contract demand  which refers to blocks of rooms sold to a specific company for an extended period of time at significantly discounted rates 
contract rates are usually utilized by hotels that are located in markets that are experiencing consistently lower levels of demand 
airline crews are typical generators of contract demand for our hotels 
understanding our performance our revenues and expenses 
our hotels are operated by third party managers under long term agreements  pursuant to which they typically earn base and incentive management fees based on the levels of revenues and profitability of each individual hotel 
we provide operating funds  or working capital  which the managers use to purchase inventory and to pay wages  utilities  property taxes and other hotel level expenses 
we generally receive a cash distribution from our hotel managers each four week or monthly accounting period  which distribution reflects hotel level sales less property level operating expenses excluding depreciation 
revenues for owned hotels are of our total revenue 
the following table presents the components of our hotel revenue as a percentage of our total revenue of revenues rooms revenue 
occupancy and average daily room rate are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
the business mix of the hotel group versus transient and premium versus discount business is a significant driver of room rates 
food and beverage revenue 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue ie  group business typically generates more food and beverage business through catering functions when compared to transient business  which may or may not utilize the hotel s restaurants 
other revenue 
occupancy  the nature of the property ie  resort  etc 
and its price point are the main drivers of other ancillary revenue  such as parking  golf course  spa  entertainment and other guest services 

table of contents hotel operating expenses are approximately of our total operating costs and expenses 
the following table presents the components of our hotel operating expenses as a percentage of our total operating costs and expenses of operating costs and expenses rooms expense 
these costs include housekeeping  reservation systems  room supplies  laundry services and front desk costs 
occupancy is the major driver of rooms expense 
these costs can increase based on increases in salaries and wages  as well as the level of service and amenities that are provided 
food and beverage expense 
these expenses primarily include food  beverage and labor costs 
occupancy and the type of customer staying at the hotel ie  catered functions generally are more profitable than outlet sales are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which correlates closely with food and beverage revenue 
other departmental and support expenses 
these expenses include labor and other costs associated with the other ancillary revenues such as parking  golf courses  spas  entertainment and other guest services  as well as labor and other costs associated with administrative departments  sales and marketing  repairs and minor maintenance and utility costs 
management fees 
base management fees are computed as a percentage of gross revenue 
incentive management fees generally are paid when operating profits exceed certain threshold levels 
other property level expenses 
these expenses consist primarily of real and personal property taxes  ground rent  equipment rent and property insurance 
many of these expenses are relatively inflexible and do not necessarily change based on changes in revenues at our hotels 
depreciation and amortization expense 
this is a non cash expense that changes primarily based on the acquisition and disposition of hotel properties and the level of past capital expenditures 
the expense components listed above are based on those presented in our consolidated statements of operations 
it also is worth noting that wage and benefit costs are spread among various line items 
taken separately  these costs represent approximately to of our hotel operating expenses 
key performance indicators 
revenue per available room revpar is a commonly used measure within the hotel industry to evaluate hotel operations 
revpar is defined as the product of the average daily room rate charged and the average daily occupancy achieved 
revpar does not include food and beverage or parking  telephone or other guest service revenues generated by the property 
although revpar does not include these ancillary revenues  it is generally considered the leading indicator of core revenues for many hotels 
revpar changes that are driven predominately by occupancy have different implications on overall revenue levels  as well as incremental operating profit  than do changes that are driven predominately by average room rate 
for example  increases in occupancy at a hotel would lead to increases in rooms revenues and ancillary revenues  such as food and beverage  as well as additional incremental costs including housekeeping services  utilities and room amenity costs 
revpar increases due to higher room rates  however  would not result in additional room related costs 
as a result  changes in revpar driven by increases or decreases in average room rates have a greater effect on profitability than changes in revpar caused by occupancy levels 
in discussing our operating results  we present revpar and certain other financial data for our hotels on a comparable hotel basis 
comparable hotels are those properties that we have owned for the entirety of the reporting 
table of contents periods being compared 
comparable hotels do not include the results of properties acquired or sold  or that incurred business interruption due to significant property damage  large scale capital improvements or significant events during these periods 
we also evaluate the performance of our business through certain non gaap financial measures 
each of these non gaap measures should be considered by investors as supplemental measures to gaap performance measures such as total revenues  operating profit  net income and earnings per share 
we provide a more detailed discussion of these non gaap financial measures  how management uses such measures to evaluate our financial condition and operating performance and a discussion of certain limitations of such measures in non gaap financial measures 
our non gaap financial measures include host inc s funds from operations ffo and ffo per diluted share 
we use ffo and ffo per diluted share as a supplemental measure of company wide profitability 
host inc s and host lp s hotel adjusted operating profit 
hotel adjusted operating profit measures property level results before debt service and is a supplemental measure of aggregate property level profitability 
we also use hotel adjusted operating profit to evaluate the profitability of our comparable hotels 
host inc s and host lp s ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
earnings before income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization ebitda  is a commonly used measure in many industries  and management believes that such measure provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations as it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
we adjust ebitda when evaluating our performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain items  such as gains and losses related to real estate transactions and impairment losses adjusted ebitda  provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance 
summary of operating results during  the lodging recovery exceeded industry expectations as overall revpar grew compared to similarly  revpar at our comparable hotels increased compared to as is expected during a recovery  the initial improvements in revpar were driven by improvements in occupancy  which improved by percentage points in overall  average room rates were essentially flat  with an improvement of during the year  however  as the year progressed  lodging demand improved and our managers were able to increase rates  somewhat shifting pricing power away from the consumer 
as a result  comparable hotel rates for the third and fourth quarter of improved and  respectively 
early in the year  the recovery was driven by increased demand from corporate transient business  which was eventually joined by improvements across the majority of our customer types 
this revpar improvement includes a improvement in comparable hotel transient revpar and a improvement in comparable hotel group revpar 
typically  the recovery of group revenue will lag that of transient revenue as price increases and business mix changes can more quickly increase transient average rates  and because group contracts that were negotiated near the bottom of the lodging cycle reflect lower rates and  therefore  will slow recovery for group revenues in the near term 
as a result of these trends  total comparable revenues for our owned hotels increased million  or  to approximately billion for the year 
in addition to the hotel revenues for our owned hotels described above  our other revenues increased million due to the inclusion of hotel revenues from a portfolio of courtyard by marriott and residence inn by marriott hotels leased from hospitality properties trust that had been previously sublet the hpt portfolio  see off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 
therefore  overall revenue increased million  or  to approximately billion for as described above  the improvements in revpar were primarily driven by occupancy gains  which have less of a positive effect on overall profitability compared to increases driven by average room rate 
as a result  the improvement in overall profitability was partially offset by increases in incremental costs at the hotels as well as the decline in the cancellation and attrition revenues 
additionally  our total expenses include rental and hotel level 
table of contents expenses for the leased hpt portfolio  described above  of million  which decreased our overall operating profit by million 
other significant items that affected the comparability of our results between and include the recognition of million of acquisition costs related to our successful hotel acquisitions  which costs are now required to be recorded in corporate expenses when incurred 
prior to the change in accounting treatment effective january   these costs would have been capitalized and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset  and  an increase in interest expense during due to costs associated with debt extinguishments including the acceleration of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts totaling million  compared to a net gain of million on debt extinguishments in impairment charges related to real estate and investments totaling million 
of these impairment charges  million was included in depreciation expense  million was included in discontinued operations and million was included in equity in affiliates 
no impairment charges were recorded in  gains on dispositions totaling million compared to a loss on dispositions of million in  and  charges related to a potential litigation loss of million 
as a result of the improved operations  and the items described above  gaap operating profit increased to million in our comparable hotel adjusted operating profit  which reflects the hotel level revenues and expenses for our comparable hotels and does not include the items described above or the results of the hpt portfolio  increased million  or  to million 
net loss for host inc decreased million in to a loss of million and adjusted ebitda increased million  or  to million 
host inc s diluted loss per common share decreased 
to a loss in of 
the reduction in our loss per diluted share reflects the improvement in operating results at our hotels as described above 
host inc s ffo per diluted share increased to 
for for and  the transactions described above reduced net loss per diluted share by 
and  respectively  and reduced ffo per diluted share by 
and  respectively 
the trends and transactions described above for host inc similarly affected the operating results for host l 
p  as the only significant difference between the host inc and host lp statements of operations relates to the treatment of income attributable to the outside partners of host lp for the year  host lp s net loss declined million to million  and the loss per diluted unit declined 
to

financing activities during  we continued to progress in our overall goal to strengthen our balance sheet by lowering our debt to equity ratio  however  we shifted our focus from increasing our liquidity which was our main focus in the uncertain recessionary period of to strategically raising and deploying capital to improve our overall leverage ratios  while at the same time completing substantial investments in our portfolio through acquisitions and capital investments 
as a result of these efforts during the year  we issued million of series u senior notes and repaid approximately billion of senior notes and mortgage debt 
we also assumed million of mortgage debt  of which million was repaid in the fourth quarter  and drew million under our credit facility in connection with our acquisitions 
overall  our debt balance was reduced by million from december   
table of contents we issued million common shares under our at the market offering programs 
the shares were issued at an average price of per share for net proceeds of million 
proceeds from these issuances were used to fund acquisitions and capital investments  as of december   of our properties are unencumbered by mortgage debt  we improved our overall leverage and coverage ratios  as defined in our senior note and credit facility covenants 
specifically  our leverage ratio total debt ebitda  as defined decreased basis points to x and our interest coverage ratio ebitda interest  as defined increased basis points to x  and at year end  we held over billion of cash and cash equivalents and had million of availability under our credit facility 
we expect to deploy over million of cash to execute our recently announced acquisitions discussed below 
we believe  based on the overall strength of our balance sheet  that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets in order to pay our near term debt maturities  fund our capital expenditures programs and take advantage of investment opportunities for a detailed discussion  see liquidity and capital resources 
investing activities acquisitions 
marked a significant increase in transaction activity for luxury and upper upscale lodging properties from the extremely depressed levels in we believe that the lodging industry is in the early stages of a recovery  which presents an opportunity to purchase assets with high growth potential at a significant discount to replacement cost 
many of the acquisition opportunities are associated with the significant number of hotel properties that are encumbered with very high levels of debt that are facing maturity deadlines and have few  if any  refinancing options 
in many cases  we expect that these owners will seek to meet the financing obligations through an all cash sale of the hotel 
in addition  lenders are foreclosing on hotels with the objective of a subsequent sale 
an example of this type of transaction is our recent acquisition of the w new york  union square 
during  we completed the following acquisitions the room jw marriott  rio de janeiro for approximately r million million  the room w new york  union square for approximately million  through a joint venture in which we are the controlling partner 
our investment was approximately million  the room westin chicago river north for approximately million  and the leasehold interest in the room le m ridien piccadilly for approximately million million 
subsequent to year end  we completed the acquisition of a portfolio of seven hotels in new zealand and entered into agreements to purchase hotels in new york and san diego as follows in january  we entered into an agreement to acquire the room new york helmsley hotel for million 
the property will be managed by starwood  initially as an unbranded hotel 
as part of a comprehensive renovation costing approximately million  the guestrooms and guest baths will be completely renovated  a few rooms will be added to the inventory and the meeting space will be upgraded 
when the renovations are complete in early to mid  the property will be branded as a westin 
while the hotel will benefit from starwood s management and reservation system as an unbranded hotel  operations of the hotel will be negatively affected during the renovation process 
this acquisition is expected to close in march  subject to customary closing conditions 
in february  we also entered into an agreement to acquire the entity that owns the  room manchester grand hyatt san diego  and certain related rights  for million 
the hotel is located along the waterfront  adjacent to the city s central business district and convention center and has over  
table of contents square feet of meeting space  six food and beverage outlets  and a  square foot spa 
the transaction will be comprised of cash consideration of million  including the repayment of million of existing loans 
we will also issue approximately million of common op units and million of preferred op units 
we will also record a note receivable equal in value to the preferred op units 
the interest rate on the note receivable will be percentage points less than the dividend rate on the preferred op units 
in accordance with asc  a right of setoff exists between the note receivable and the preferred op units  as the proceeds from the redemption of the preferred op units must be used to repay the note receivable 
therefore  neither will be reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
the transaction is expected to close in march of  and is subject to various closing conditions  including approval by the san diego unified port district 
on february   we completed the acquisition of a portfolio of seven midscale and upscale hotels in new zealand for approximately million  including million of mortgage debt 
the properties are located in the cities of auckland  queenstown  christchurch and wellington and will be operated by accor under the ibis and novotel brands 
accor is a leading international hotel operator with over  hotels and  rooms in countries worldwide 
repositioning and return on investment capital expenditures 
during and  we completed a total of million and million  respectively  in roi repositioning expenditures at numerous properties 
for  repositioning and roi expenditures included the following projects san diego marriott hotel marina an extensive multi year million project to reposition and renovate the hotel which will include all  guest rooms  the pool and fitness center  as well as the expansion and development of new meeting space and an exhibit hall  westin kierland resort spa the development of a new  square foot ballroom and  square foot outdoor venue space  and  miami marriott biscayne bay completed extensive lobby renovations and the development of a three meal restaurant  as well as the conversion of  square feet to meeting space 
we expect that our investment in roi and repositioning expenditures in will total approximately million to million  including million of projects at the following properties sheraton new york hotel towers the complete renovation of all  rooms  as well as major mechanical upgrades to the heating and cooling system  atlanta marriott perimeter center complete repositioning of the hotel including rooms renovation  lobby enhancements  mechanical systems upgrades  parking garage and exterior enhancements  chicago marriott o hare complete repositioning of the hotel including rooms renovation  new meeting space and the creation of a new great room and lobby  san diego marriott hotel marina continuation of the extensive renovation and repositioning project begun in  and  sheraton indianapolis renovation of rooms  lobby  fitness center  bar and restaurant  as well as the conversion of an existing tower into managed apartments 
renewal and replacement capital expenditures 
in addition to the repositioning roi expenditures described above  we spent million and million on renewal and replacement expenditures during and  respectively 
these expenditures are designed to ensure that our high standards for product quality are maintained and to enhance the overall competitiveness of our properties in the marketplace 
major renewal and replacement projects that were underway during the fourth quarter of included rooms at the fairmont kea 
table of contents lani   square feet of meeting space at the sheraton boston   square feet of meeting space at the philadelphia marriott downtown  rooms at the san antonio marriott rivercenter and  square feet of meeting space at the hyatt regency washington on capitol hill 
dispositions 
the market for selling hotels located in secondary and tertiary markets  which are our primary disposition targets  remains challenging 
we disposed of two non core properties in for a total of approximately million where we believed that the potential for future returns were lower than our target levels 
outlook forecasts for real gdp growth in improved significantly in the fourth quarter of  as the pace of consumer spending increased and the tax legislation package was passed in late december 
economists also anticipate substantial growth in business investment for  which is a key driver for our industry  and for transient demand in particular 
however  full year operating forecasts remain uncertain  particularly as employment levels and the housing market remain weak points in the overall economic outlook 
as detailed in our operating results  s revpar improvement was primarily driven by improvements in occupancy  as rate increases were not broadly recognized across the portfolio until the second half of the year 
for  as the recovery moves into its next phase  we anticipate that the improvements in revpar will be driven by both rate and occupancy growth  which will have a more significant positive effect on our operating results 
at the same time  we also anticipate that supply growth in the lodging industry will remain at historically low levels in as the disruption in the credit markets and weak lodging performance caused a significant decline in new hotel construction starts beginning in the second half of through this may be particularly relevant for the markets and lodging sectors in which we compete due to the long term planning and high level of investment associated with luxury and upper upscale lodging properties in urban and resort destinations 
we believe that lower supply growth will have a positive effect in  as the improvements in lodging demand will not lead to a corresponding increase in supply 
based on the lack of new construction starts in recent years  we believe that supply growth should remain below the historical trend for the lodging industry for the next few years 
based on the trends discussed above and the forecast roi repositioning projects  as well as other capital expenditures at our properties  we anticipate that comparable hotel revpar will increase to during we believe that the positive trends in the lodging industry create the opportunity for business improvements  which when combined with our strategy to enhance our portfolio through acquisitions and capital projects will ultimately improve the competitive position of our properties and stockholder value 
however  there can be no assurances that any increases in hotel revenues or earnings at our properties will continue for any number of reasons  including  but not limited to  slower than anticipated growth in the economy and changes in travel patterns

revenues for properties sold in or have been reclassified to discontinued operations 
see discontinued operations below 
rooms 
the increase in room revenue in is consistent with the overall increase in revpar  primarily due to occupancy gains at our hotels 
while the majority of the increase is due to the increase in revpar at our comparable hotels  there was also a increase related to the revenues recorded at the hotels acquired during the year 
food and beverage 
the increase in food and beverage revenue in is primarily attributable to increased occupancy  which contributes to greater demand for catering and banquet business 
other 
the decrease in other revenues for owned hotels in is primarily a result of a decline in attrition and cancellation fees of approximately million 
other revenues 
for  the increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of the hpt hotel revenue 
on july   we terminated the subleases for hotels leased from hpt because the subtenants failed to meet net worth covenants 
accordingly  beginning on july   we record the operations of the hotels instead of rental income  which we have recorded in other revenues 
for  revenues for hotels leased from hpt include hotel revenues of million and rental income of million 
for  revenues for hotels leased from hpt include rental income of million 
the property revenues and rental income recorded  less the hotel expenses and rental expenses for the hpt properties  resulted in net losses of million and million for and  respectively 
effective december  we terminated the leases with respect to of these properties 
we also have given notice that we plan to terminate the leases with respect to the remaining properties in december see off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations 
while management evaluates the performance of each individual hotel against its competitive set in a given market  overall we evaluate the portfolio operating results using three different criteria property type ie urban  suburban  resort conference or airport  geographic region and mix of business ie transient  group or contract

during  comparable hotel revpar increased across all of our hotel property types 
our urban properties led the portfolio  with a increase in revpar for the year 
the continued improvement in demand has allowed our operators to begin to increase the average room rates at our urban properties  which improved overall for the year 
our suburban properties also experienced a significant revpar increase in driven by strength in the suburban boston  orange county and san francisco markets 
our resort conference hotels lagged the portfolio as a whole  as the improvement in revpar at our resort conference properties in our florida region were partially offset by the revpar declines in the phoenix and palm springs markets

for  comparable hotel revpar improved across all of our geographic regions when compared to our new england region was the top performing us region  with revpar growth of that was driven by revpar growth of in the boston market 
this increase was due to strong group and transient demand  as occupancy increased percentage points and average room rates increased 

table of contents the revpar growth in our atlanta region was driven primarily by strong city wide and transient business in the fourth quarter 
strong demand from both group and transient customers drove a percentage point occupancy increase in the fourth quarter 
revpar in our mid atlantic region grew for the year  driven by revpar growth at our new york properties of 
for our new york properties  rate improved and occupancy improved by percentage points 
our florida region had an increase in revpar of for the year  led by strong performance at our resort conference hotels in this region 
revpar at our florida resort conference hotels increased for the year  driven primarily by an increase in occupancy of percentage points  however  this increase was affected by lower group demand as well as significant renovations at the orlando world center marriott resort and convention center in the fourth quarter 
the revpar increase for the year in our north central region was driven by our chicago hotels  as revpar increased due to strong transient demand and rate increased 
results in our mountain region were mixed  as the denver market experienced a increase in revpar primarily due to strong group and transient demand  while the phoenix market experienced a decline in revpar  which was partially attributable to the renovation of a significant amount of meeting space at two hotels and the construction of a new ballroom at the westin kierland 
our dc metro region underperformed the portfolio in terms of revpar growth which reflects difficult comparisons to the prior year  particularly during the first quarter  due to the presidential inauguration and other government related activities 
hotel sales by business mix 
the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient  group and contract business 
the information below is derived from business mix data for of our hotels for which information is available from our managers 
in  overall transient revpar increased when compared to  reflecting an increase in total room nights of  and an increase in average rates of 
the rate increase was driven primarily by a increase in average rate for corporate transient business and a shift in mix away from discounted business 
during  group revpar increased approximately  reflecting an increase in total room nights of  partially offset by a decrease in average rates of 
typically  recovery in the group segment will follow improvement in transient demand due to longer booking lead times 
as a result  a large portion of the group business was sold at the lower rates in effect in prior periods 
therefore  while we did experience improvements in group demand  improvements in overall group revenue continues to lag that of transient revenue 
compared to the decrease in hotel sales and food and beverage revenues was primarily attributable to decreased occupancy  which drives lower room rates and less demand for catering and banquet business  as well as other ancillary revenues such as spas  golf  parking  internet connectivity and other fees 
sales for properties disposed of in both years have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
see discontinued operations below 
consistent with the portfolio as a whole  comparable hotel revpar decreased  with a percentage point decrease in occupancy and a decrease in average room rates 
another factor that contributed to the decrease in revenues was corporate travelers downgrading from luxury properties to other hotel segments due to political and public relations concerns regarding corporate expenditures on luxury services 
this had a significant effect on our ritz carlton properties as well as our resort locations

we believe the location of these assets provided a diversified demand base that helped drive higher levels of occupancy  which partially mitigated the decline in average room rate compared to other property types 
as noted above  our resort conference properties were particularly affected by traveler concerns regarding corporate expenditures for luxury hotels and services

other than the dc metro region  all of our regions had substantial declines in revpar  though results reflect the different dynamics of the major markets within each region 
revpar at hotels in our top performing dc metro region declined  though individual properties within the region varied from an increase of to a decline of in revpar  with the strongest performers being our downtown properties that benefited from government and government related activity 
similarly  the revpar decline in the south central region included a revpar decrease of in new orleans and a decline of in houston 

table of contents hotel sales by business mix 
the majority of our customers fall into three broad groups transient  group and contract business 
the information below is derived from business mix data for of our hotels for which information is available from our managers 
in  transient revpar decreased when compared to  reflecting a slight decline in total room nights and a decline in average rate of 
the decline primarily reflects a shift from the higher rated premium and corporate business to the price sensitive transient discount business 
room nights for premium and corporate business declined  despite a decline in average rates of  which led to a revpar decline of in this business 
this was slightly offset by the growth in room nights from price sensitive transient discount business as customers  particularly leisure travelers  utilized discount programs implemented by our managers  as well as  third party travel websites offering discounted rates 
group revpar declined approximately reflecting a decline in total room nights of and a decline in average room rates of 
the decline in room rate was primarily due to corporate group discounts and short term group rate concessions 
the primary driver of the decline in room nights was a significant reduction in corporate group business of 
in addition to significant reductions in corporate group meetings  this also reflects low attendance at group meetings and groups increasingly renegotiating rates 
property level operating expenses change to change to in millions in millions rooms food and beverage other departmental and support expenses management fees other property level expenses depreciation and amortization total property level operating expenses compared to and compared to the overall increase in operating expenses in is consistent with higher overall revpar at our properties and improvement in occupancy at our hotels 
the overall decrease in operating expenses in is consistent with lower overall demand at our properties and our hotel managers actively implementing contingency plans and cost saving measures in order to manage operating margin decline 
our operating costs and expenses  which are both fixed and variable  are affected by changes in occupancy  inflationary increases and revenues which affect management fees  though the effect on specific costs will differ 
property level operating expenses exclude the costs associated with hotels we have sold during the periods presented  which costs are included in discontinued operations 
rooms 
the increase in room expenses in is consistent with the overall increase in occupancy and was also affected by higher wage rates 
the decrease in room expenses in was primarily due to a decrease in occupancy 
we also benefited from cost cutting measures implemented by our managers that reduced controllable expenses  such as closing rooms in unused sections of the hotels  and reducing management staff and labor hours per occupied room 
food and beverage 
the increase in food and beverage costs in reflects the increase in revenues  partially offset by the positive shift in the mix of business to more catering and audio visual revenues 
however  weak productivity in banquet sales hurt overall profitability 
the decline in food and beverages costs in was primarily driven by a decrease in occupancy  which led to a reduction in food and beverages cost of goods sold  and reductions in restaurant hourly and management staff 
other departmental and support expenses 
the increase in revenues drove an increase in non controllable hotel expenses during  such as credit card commissions  bonus expense  loyalty rewards program expenses and 
table of contents cluster and shared service allocations 
the decline in these expenses in reflected a reduction in controllable expenses  such as marketing and general and administration expenses that were driven by a decrease in the wages and benefits allocated to these expenses  reflecting a decline in management staffing and bonus payouts 
additionally  in  utilities declined as a result of a decline in prices  lower occupancy levels and milder weather 
management fees 
our base management fees  which are generally calculated as a percentage of total revenues  increased for  which is consistent with the increase in revenues 
the incentive management fees  which are based on the level of operating profit at each property after the owner has received a priority return on its investment  increased during the year  consistent with the increase in operating profit at certain properties 
the decrease in is consistent with our revenue decline 
other property level expenses 
these expenses generally do not vary significantly based on occupancy and include expenses such as property taxes and insurance 
for  the increase was primarily driven by the inclusion of the hpt hotel expenses discussed below  partially offset by decreases in property insurance costs due to the reduction in premiums for our insurance program that runs from june  to may  as previously discussed  beginning on july   we record the operations of hotels leased from hpt 
for  expenses for hotels leased from hpt include rental expense of million due to hpt  as well as the million of hotel expenses incurred subsequent to the sublease termination 
for  expenses for hotels leased from hpt represent rental expense due to hpt of million 
depreciation and amortization 
the decline in depreciation expense in is due to impairment charges recorded in of approximately million 
other impairment charges for are included in equity in losses of affiliates or discontinued operations 
no impairment charges were recorded in the increase in depreciation expense in reflects the effect of our extensive billion capital expenditures program from to as well as the impairment charges described above 
other income statement line items corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses primarily consist of employee salaries and bonuses and other costs  such as employee stock based compensation expense  travel  corporate insurance  legal fees  acquisition related costs  audit fees  building rent and systems costs 
corporate expenses decreased approximately million in from and increased approximately million in from the decrease during is primarily due to litigation costs of million accrued in for a potential litigation loss 
see legal proceedings 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in stock based compensation expense and bonus accruals  as well as an increase of million associated with consummated property acquisitions 
previously  the acquisition costs would have been capitalized  however  under accounting requirements adopted in  these costs are now expensed 
the expense for the stock based compensation awards is based on personal performance  as well as host inc s stockholder return relative to other reits and to other lodging companies and will vary significantly due to fluctuations in host inc s stock price 
the increase reflects the outperformance in host inc s stockholder return relative to other reits and other lodging companies  a increase in host inc s stock price since and the overall improvement in operations 
the increase in corporate and other expenses in reflects the litigation costs described above  as well as an increase in stock based compensation expense  which returned to more normalized levels compared to gain on insurance settlement 
during  we recorded a gain of million related to the receipt of business interruption insurance related to our two hotels in chile  which were affected by the earthquake in july the damage to our properties was not severe  however  to the extent that we receive further business interruption insurance proceeds or property insurance proceeds in excess of the insurance receivable recorded for the property and equipment written off  we will record a gain 
we recorded a gain on insurance settlement of million in the gain primarily related to the insurance proceeds received for both business interruption and property damage following hurricanes katrina and wilma which occurred during september and october  respectively 

table of contents interest expense 
the increase in interest expense during is due to costs associated with debt extinguishments including the acceleration of deferred financing costs and original issue discounts totaling million compared to a net gain of million on debt extinguishments in this increase was partially offset by a net decrease in our overall debt balance  which resulted in interest savings of approximately million 
in addition  the fixed to floating interest rate swap that we entered into in the second half of for our million mortgage on the ritz carlton  naples and newport beach marriott hotel spa reduced interest expense by million for compared to the increase in interest expense during from is primarily due to a decrease of million in the net gain associated with the repurchase of our exchangeable senior debentures in and net gains on property transactions 
the significant increase in gains from property transactions in when compared to both and is due to the recognition of a million gain associated with the sale of our remaining limited partnership interest in a partnership that owned courtyard by marriott hotels 
equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
the significant increase in losses of affiliates during when compared to both and is a result of an impairment charge of million recorded in  described below  related to our investment in the european joint venture 
we evaluate the recoverability of our investment in affiliates based on our assessment of the fair value of our investment in comparison to our carrying value 
in  we determined that the carrying value of our investment in our joint venture in europe exceeded its fair value on an other than temporary basis 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million  which impairment charge is included in equity in earnings losses of affiliates 
see critical accounting policies other than temporary impairment of an investment for further discussion 
income tax benefit 
we lease substantially all of our properties to consolidated subsidiaries designated as trs for federal income tax purposes 
the difference between hotel level operating cash flow and the aggregate rent paid to host lp by the trs represents taxable income or loss  on which we record an income tax provision or benefit 
the decrease in the tax benefit in reflects lower expenses at our trs and the overall improvement in operating results at our properties 
as most of the hotels in are paying the minimum rent under the lease agreements  a significant amount of the improvement in profitability is retained by the trs and  therefore  decreases its taxable loss 
additionally  in we recognized a million tax benefit with respect to the sale of our remaining interest in the cbm joint venture limited partnership cbm jv 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations consist of two hotels disposed of in  six hotels disposed of in including one hotel for which the ground lease expired and reverted back to the ground lessor and two hotels disposed of during and represent the results of operations and the gains on the disposition of these hotels during the periods 
the following table summarizes the revenues  income before taxes  and the gain on dispositions  net of tax  of the hotels which have been reclassified to discontinued operations  which includes assets held for sale and the results of sold hotels prior to their disposition for the periods presented in millions revenues income loss before taxes gain loss on dispositions  net of tax liquidity and capital resources liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp the liquidity and capital resources of host inc and host lp are primarily derived from the activities of host lp host lp generates the capital required by our business through its operations  the direct or indirect incurrence of indebtedness  the issuance of op units or the sale of equity interests of its subsidiaries 
host inc is a reit whose only material asset is its ownership of partnership interests of host lp  therefore  its financing and investing activities are conducted through host lp  except for the issuance of its common and preferred stock 
however  proceeds from stock issuances by host inc are contributed to host lp in exchange for op units 
additionally  funds used by host inc to pay dividends or to repurchase stock are provided by host lp therefore  while we have noted those areas in which it is important to distinguish between host inc and host lp  we have not included a separate discussion of the liquidity and capital resources of each entity as the discussion below can be applied to both host inc and host lp 
table of contents overview 
we look to maintain a capital structure and liquidity profile with an appropriate balance of cash  debt and equity in order to provide financial flexibility  given the inherent volatility in the lodging industry 
during the difficult recessionary period in  we focused on improving our liquidity position through equity and debt issuances  which totaled over billion 
as a result of these efforts  we entered the growth period of with over billion of cash and million available under our credit facility 
as the overall economy  credit markets and lodging industry strengthened during  we shifted the focus of our financing efforts from maintaining liquidity to strategically decreasing our debt to equity ratio through i acquisitions and other investments  the majority of which were completed with available cash and proceeds from equity issuances  and ii the repayment and refinancing of senior notes and mortgage debt 
as a result  we have improved our overall leverage and coverage ratios  issued million of equity and completed million of acquisitions and other capital investments during the year 
at the same time  our liquidity position remains very strong  with over billion of cash and cash equivalents prior to amounts used for the acquisitions discussed herein and million available capacity under our credit facility 
we also look to structure our debt profile to allow us to access different forms of financing  primarily senior notes and exchangeable debentures  as well as mortgage debt 
generally  this means that we will look to minimize the number of assets that are encumbered by mortgage debt  minimize near term maturities  and maintain a balanced maturity schedule 
as of december   of our hotels are unencumbered by mortgage debt and approximately of our debt consists of senior notes and borrowings under our credit facility  both of which are guaranteed by various subsidiaries and secured by pledges in subsidiaries  but are not collateralized by specific hotel properties 
additionally  our maturities for are of our total debt million of mortgage debt and million outstanding under our credit facility 
further  based on our current forecasts  we expect to extend the credit facility maturity one year to september of we believe that we have sufficient liquidity and access to the capital markets to take advantage of opportunities to enhance our portfolio  withstand declines in operating cash flow  pay our near term debt maturities and fund our capital expenditures programs 
we may continue to opportunistically access the capital markets if favorable market conditions exist in order to further enhance our liquidity and to fund cash needs 
the chart below details our significant cash flows for the three years ended december  operating activities cash provided by operating activities investing activities acquisitions and investment dispositions and return of investment capital expenditures financing activities issuances of debt net draws repayments on credit facility repurchase of senior notes  including exchangeable debentures debt prepayments and scheduled maturities host inc common stock issuances common stock repurchase redemption of preferred stock dividends on common stock host lp common op unit issuance common op unit repurchase redemption of preferred units distributions on common op units 
table of contents cash requirements 
we use cash primarily for acquisitions  capital expenditures  debt payments  operating costs  corporate and other expenses  and dividends and distributions to stockholders and unitholders 
as a reit  host inc is required to distribute to its stockholders at least of its taxable income  excluding net capital gain  on an annual basis 
funds used by host inc to make cash distributions are provided by host lp our primary sources of cash are cash from operations  proceeds from the sale of assets  borrowings under our credit facility and debt and equity issuances 
below is a schedule of our debt maturities through as of december   our weighted average interest rate is and our weighted average maturity is years 
see financial condition for more information on our debt maturities 
during  we took advantage of our strong financial position to repay million of debt which is net of million of debt issuances and assumptions and million of preferred stock and the corresponding preferred units 
remaining debt maturities in millions mortgage loan on four canadian properties credit facility draw mortgage loan  le m ridien piccadilly exchangeable senior debentures senior notes mortgage loan  orlando world center marriott mortgage loan  jw marriott  washington  d 
c principal amortization on other debt total maturities we have the option to extend the maturity for an additional year if the applicable conditions are met 
these mortgages can be extended for one year  at our option  provided that debt coverage exceeds certain ratios and other conditions are met 
our exchangeable senior debentures are due in  but are subject to a put option by the holders on april  the million represents the face amount of the outstanding principal at december  capital resources 
as of december   we had over billion of cash and cash equivalents  which was a decrease of million from december  we also had million available under our credit facility at december  we depend primarily on external sources of capital to finance future growth  including acquisitions 
as a result  the liquidity and debt capacity provided by our credit facility and the ability to issue senior unsecured debt are key components of our capital structure 
therefore  our financial flexibility including our ability to incur debt  make distributions and make investments is contingent on our ability to maintain compliance with the financial covenants  which include  among other things  the allowable amounts of leverage  coverage and fixed charges 
during and  we have significantly decreased our near term debt maturities  reduced our secured mortgage indebtedness and maintained compliance with our senior note and credit facility covenants  despite the difficult operating and credit environment in if  at any time  we determine that market conditions are favorable  after taking into account our liquidity requirements  we may seek to issue and sell shares of host inc common stock in registered public offerings  including through sales directly on the new york stock exchange nyse under an at the market offering program  or to issue and sell shares of host inc preferred stock 
we also may seek to cause host lp to issue  in offerings exempt from registration under the securities laws  debentures exchangeable for shares of host inc common stock or senior notes 
given our total debt level and maturity schedule  we will continue to redeem or refinance senior notes and mortgage debt from time to time  taking advantage of favorable market conditions  when available 
in february  host inc s board of directors authorized repurchases up to million of senior notes  exchangeable debentures and mortgage debt other than in accordance with its terms 
separately  the board of directors authorized redemptions and repurchases of all or a portion of million principal amount of our exchangeable debentures  and we are currently evaluating options with respect to this security 
any redemption of the exchangeable debentures will not reduce the million of board authority noted above to repurchase other debt securities 
we may purchase senior notes and exchangeable debentures for cash through open 
table of contents market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  a tender offer or  in some cases  through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms 
repurchases of debt  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
any refinancing or retirement before the maturity date would affect earnings and ffo per diluted share as a result of the payment of any applicable call premiums and the acceleration of previously deferred financing costs 
accordingly  in light of our priorities in managing our capital structure and liquidity profile  and given the movement in prevailing conditions in the capital markets  we may  at any time  subject to applicable securities laws  be considering  or be in discussions with respect to  the purchase or sale of common stock  exchangeable debentures and or senior notes 
any such transactions may  subject to applicable securities laws  occur simultaneously 
on august   host inc entered into a new sales agency financing agreement with bny mellon capital markets  llc  through which host inc may issue and sell  from time to time  shares of common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to million 
this agreement followed the completion of million of sales under a similar agreement  also with bny mellon capital markets  llc  that was entered into in the sales have been and will continue to be made in at the market offerings under sec rules  including sales made directly on the nyse 
bny mellon capital markets  llc is acting as sales agent 
host inc may continue to sell shares of common stock under this program from time to time based on market conditions  although we are not under an obligation to sell any shares 
host inc has approximately million remaining under this program 
as of december   our secured mortgage indebtedness totaled approximately billion  which represents approximately of our overall indebtedness  and is secured by of our hotels 
given the flexibility provided by the structure of our balance sheet  we will look to access the capital markets for senior notes and exchangeable debentures and the secured mortgage debt market  based on relative pricing and capacity in order to fund our cash requirements 
we may  at any time  seek to access such markets in the event that we determine that the terms and conditions available to us are advantageous  based upon prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other circumstances 
see financial condition for further discussion of our restrictive covenants 
counterparty credit risk 
we are subject to counterparty credit risk  which relates to the ability of counterparties to meet their contractual payment obligations or the potential non performance of counterparties to deliver contracted commodities or services at the contracted price 
we assess the ability of our counterparties to fulfill their obligation to determine the impact  if any  of counterparty bankruptcy or insolvency on our financial condition 
we are exposed to credit risk with respect to cash held at various financial institutions  access to our credit facility and amounts due or payable under our derivative contracts 
our credit exposure in each of these cases is limited 
our exposure with regard to our cash and the million available under our credit facility is mitigated  as the credit risk is spread among a diversified group of investment grade financial institutions 
at december   the exposure risk related to our derivative contracts totaled million and the counterparties were investment grade financial institutions 
sources and uses of cash 
during  our sources of cash included cash from operations  proceeds from debt and equity issuances and proceeds from the sale of assets 
uses of cash during the year consisted of acquisitions  capital expenditures  operating costs  debt repayments and repurchases and distributions to equity holders 
during  we anticipate that our primary uses of cash will include acquisitions and investments  capital expenditures at our hotels  the repayment or repurchase of our debt maturing in the near term and distributions to equity holders 
we anticipate that our primary sources of cash for will include cash from operations and proceeds from equity and debt issuances 
cash provided by operations 
our cash provided by operations for decreased million to million compared to  due primarily to timing of cash receipts from our managers  increased costs associated with debt prepayments and increased required reserves for possible legal damages 
cash used in investing activities 
approximately million of cash was used in investing activities during this included approximately million of acquisitions and deposits for future acquisitions  which is net of debt and other liabilities assumed  million of capital expenditures and the investment in two junior tranches of a mortgage loan in europe 

table of contents capital expenditures 
in  total capital expenditures decreased million to million 
our renewal and replacement capital expenditures for were approximately million  which reflects an increase of approximately from levels 
our renewal and replacement capital expenditures are generally funded by the furniture  fixture and equipment funds established at certain of our hotels typically funded with approximately of property revenues and by our available cash 
we also spent approximately million in on roi repositioning projects  which reflects a decrease of approximately compared to levels 
while capital expenditures declined in  they have totaled approximately billion over the past five years 
as a result  we believe that our properties are in a strong competitive position with respect to their market competitors 
acquisitions dispositions and investments 
during  in separate transactions  we purchased four hotel assets located in london  new york  chicago and rio de janeiro  respectively  for an aggregate amount of approximately million and purchased the junior portion of a mortgage loan secured by a portfolio of hotels 
we recorded the purchase price of the acquired assets and liabilities at the estimated fair value on the date of purchase 
for  our property acquisitions were as follows on september   we acquired the room jw marriott  rio de janeiro for approximately r million million  on september   we formed a joint venture with a subsidiary of istithmar world to purchase the room w new york  union square 
we have a managing membership interest in the joint venture and  therefore  consolidate the entity 
the joint venture purchased the hotel for million  which  in addition to cash consideration  includes the assumption of million of mortgage debt  with a fair value of million  and other liabilities of million 
the fair value of the debt was determined using the present value of future cash flows 
additionally  in conjunction with the acquisition  the joint venture purchased restricted cash and ff e reserve funds at the hotel in the amount of million 
the joint venture acquired the hotel as part of the settlement agreement reached with the previous owners and mezzanine lenders on july   on august   we acquired the room westin chicago river north for approximately million  and on july   we acquired the leasehold interest in the room le m ridien piccadilly in london  england for million million  including cash consideration of approximately million million and the assumption of a million million mortgage 
as part of the purchase of the leasehold interest  we acquired restricted cash and working capital at the hotel in the amount of million million 
in connection with the acquisition  we assumed a capital lease obligation which we valued at million million 
the capital lease obligation is included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and increased the book value of the leasehold interest purchased 
we also recorded a deferred tax liability of million million  a deferred tax asset of million million and goodwill of million million related to the difference in the hotel valuation measured at fair value on the acquisition date and the tax basis of the asset 
we drew million million from our credit facility in order to fund the cash portion of the acquisition 
additionally  during  we disposed of two non core properties where we believed the potential for profitability growth was low 
proceeds from these sales were approximately million 
while we continue to actively explore potential acquisitions  given the nature of the transactions  we cannot assure you that we will be successful in acquiring any one or more hotel properties that we may review  bid on or negotiate to purchase 
we may acquire additional properties through various structures  including transactions involving single assets  portfolios  joint ventures and acquisitions of all or substantially all of the securities or assets of other reits 
we anticipate that future acquisitions will be funded primarily by proceeds from equity offerings of host inc  or issuance of op units by host lp  but potentially also from the proceeds from sales of properties from our existing portfolio  the incurrence of debt  available cash or advances under our credit facility

senior notes 
the following summary is a description of the material provisions of the indentures governing our various senior notes issued by host lp  which we refer to collectively as the senior notes indenture 
we pay interest on each series of our outstanding senior notes at specified dates in arrears at the respective annual rates indicated on the table above 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  our senior notes are equal in right of payment with all of host lp s unsubordinated indebtedness and senior to all subordinated obligations of host lp the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries and are secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture  as well as our credit facility  certain other senior debt  and interest rate swap agreements and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
the pledges are permitted to be released in the event that our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
because our leverage ratio is below this threshold  we have the right to release all pledges at any time 
in october  we exercised this right for pledges of capital stock that would have been otherwise required subsequent to this date 
restrictive covenants 
under the terms of the senior notes indenture  our ability to incur indebtedness and make distributions is subject to restrictions and the satisfaction of various conditions  including the achievement of an ebitda to interest coverage ratio of at least x 
this ratio is calculated in accordance with the terms of our senior notes indenture based on pro forma results for the four prior fiscal quarters giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings  as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
under the terms of our senior notes indenture  interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility  amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan to establish the debt at fair value and approximately million of non cash interest expense recorded in related to our exchangeable debentures  all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
our subsidiaries are subject to the restrictive covenants in the indenture  however  in certain circumstances  we are permitted to designate certain subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries 
these unrestricted subsidiaries are not subject to the restrictive covenants unless they are guarantors and may engage in transactions to dispose of or encumber their assets or otherwise incur additional indebtedness without complying with the restrictive covenants in the indenture 
if we were to designate additional subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries  neither the ebitda generated by nor the interest expense allocated to these 
table of contents entities would be included in our ratio calculations 
other covenants limiting our ability to incur indebtedness  host inc s ability to pay dividends and host lp s ability to make distributions include maintaining total indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets using undepreciated real estate book values  excluding intangible assets  and secured indebtedness of less than of adjusted total assets 
so long as we maintain the required level of interest coverage and satisfy these and other conditions in the senior notes indenture  we may make preferred or common op unit distributions and incur additional debt under the senior notes indenture  including debt incurred in connection with an acquisition 
in addition  even if we are below the coverage levels otherwise required to incur debt and make distributions  we are still permitted to incur certain types of debt  including i credit facility debt  ii refinancing debt  iii up to million or million  depending on the series of senior notes  of mortgage debt whose proceeds would be used to repay debt under credit facility and permanently reduce our ability to borrow under the credit facility by such amount  and iv up to million or million  depending on the series of senior notes  of other debt 
we also are permitted to make distributions of estimated taxable income that are necessary to maintain host inc s reit status 
our senior notes indenture also imposes restrictions on customary matters  such as host lp s ability to make distributions on  redeem or repurchase its op units  make investments  permit payment or dividend restrictions on certain of our subsidiaries  sell assets  guarantee indebtedness  enter into transactions with affiliates  create certain liens  and sell certain assets or merge with or into other companies 
our senior notes indenture also imposes a requirement to maintain unencumbered assets as defined in the indenture as undepreciated property book value of not less than of the aggregate amount of senior note debt plus other debt not secured by mortgages 
this coverage requirement must be maintained at all times and is distinct from the coverage requirements necessary to incur debt or make distributions discussed above whose consequences  where we fall below the coverage level  are limited to restricting our ability to incur new debt or make distributions  but which would not otherwise cause a default under our senior notes indenture

as of december   we have three series of exchangeable senior debentures outstanding million of debentures that were issued on december  the debentures  million of debentures that were issued on march  and million of debentures that were issued on march  the debentures 
we refer to these collectively as the debentures 
the debentures are equal in right of payment with all of our other senior notes 
holders have the right to require us to purchase the debentures at a price equal to of the principal amount outstanding plus accrued interest the put option on certain dates subsequent to their respective issuances 
holders of the debentures also have the right to exchange the debentures prior to maturity under certain conditions  including at any time at which the closing price of host inc s common stock is more than for the debentures or for the and debentures of the exchange price per share for at least of consecutive trading days during certain periods or any time up to two days prior to the date on which the debentures have been called for redemption 
we can redeem for cash all  or part of  any of the debentures at any time subsequent to each of their respective redemption dates at a redemption price of of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
if  at any time  we elect to redeem the debentures and the exchange value exceeds the cash redemption price  we would expect the holders to elect to exchange the debentures at the respective exchange value rather than receive the cash redemption price 
the exchange value is equal to the applicable exchange rate multiplied by the price of host inc s common stock 
upon exchange  the debentures would be exchanged for host inc s common stock  the debentures would be exchanged for a combination of cash for the principal balance of the debentures and host inc s common stock for the remainder of the exchange value and the debentures would be exchanged for host inc s common stock  cash or a combination thereof  at our option

collateral and guarantees 
the obligations under the credit facility are guaranteed by certain of our existing subsidiaries which are the same subsidiaries that guarantee our senior notes and are currently secured by pledges of equity interests in many of our subsidiaries 
the pledges  but not the guarantees  are permitted to be released in the event that certain conditions are satisfied  including the requirement that our leverage ratio falls below x for two consecutive fiscal quarters 
as a result of having satisfied such conditions  currently we are not required to pledge our equity interests in any newly acquired or newly formed subsidiary  and at our election  we may obtain a release of all existing pledges for so long as our leverage ratio remains below x 
the guarantees and pledges ratably benefit our credit facility  as well as the notes outstanding under our senior notes indenture  interest rate swap agreements  and other hedging agreements with lenders that are parties to the credit facility 
prepayments 
the loans under the credit facility are required to be prepaid  subject to certain exceptions  with excess proceeds from certain asset sales 
voluntary prepayments of the loans under the credit facility are permitted in whole or in part without premium or penalty 
financial covenants 
the credit facility contains covenants concerning allowable leverage  fixed charge coverage and unsecured interest coverage 
currently  we are permitted to make borrowings and maintain amounts outstanding under the credit facility so long as our leverage ratio does not exceed x and our unsecured coverage ratio is not less than x and our fixed charge coverage ratio is not less than x 
if our leverage ratio equals or exceeds x  new borrowings are limited to such amount as does not cause the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the credit facility to exceed million 
however  to the extent our borrowings under the credit facility revolver exceed million on the date that our leverage ratio exceeds x  we are not required to repay the excess for one year 
the financial covenants for the credit facility do not apply when there are no borrowings under the credit facility 
so long as there are no amounts outstanding  we would not be in default if we did not satisfy the financial covenants and we would not lose the potential to draw under the credit facility in the future if we were ever to regain compliance with the financial covenants 
these calculations are performed in accordance with our credit facility based on pro forma results for the prior four fiscal quarters  giving effect to transactions such as acquisitions  dispositions and financings as if they occurred at the beginning of the period 
under the terms of the credit facility  interest expense excludes items such as the gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt  deferred financing charges related to the senior notes or the credit facility  amortization of debt premiums or discounts that were recorded at acquisition of a loan in order to establish the debt at fair value and non cash interest expense recorded as a result of the adoption of accounting standards relating to our exchangeable debentures  all of which are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  total debt used in the calculation of our leverage ratio is based on a net debt concept  under which cash and cash equivalents in excess of million is deducted from our total debt balance

in the case of libor based borrowings in us dollars  as 
table of contents well as euros and pounds sterling denominated borrowings  the rate of interest ranges from basis points to basis points over libor 
we also have the option to pay interest based on the higher of the overnight federal funds rate plus basis points and the prime lending rate plus  in both cases  the applicable spread ranging from to basis points 
based on our leverage ratio at december  of x  we can borrow at a rate of libor plus basis points or prime plus basis points 
to the extent that amounts under the credit facility remain unused  we pay a quarterly commitment fee on the unused portion of the loan commitment of to basis points  depending on our average revolver usage during the applicable period 
other covenants and events of default 
the credit facility contains restrictive covenants on customary matters 
certain covenants become less restrictive at any time that our leverage ratio falls below x 
in particular  at any time that our leverage ratio is below x  we will not be subject to limitations on capital expenditures  and the limitations on acquisitions  investments  dividends and distributions contained in the credit facility will be superseded by the generally less restrictive corresponding covenants in our senior notes indenture 
additionally  the credit facility s restrictions on incurrence of debt and the payment of dividends and distributions are generally consistent with our senior notes indenture 
these provisions  under certain circumstances  limit debt incurrence to debt incurred under the credit facility or in connection with a refinancing  and limit dividend payments to those necessary to maintain host inc s tax status as a reit 
the credit facility also includes usual and customary events of default for facilities of this nature  and provides that  upon the occurrence and continuance of an event of default  payment of all amounts due under the credit facility may be accelerated  the lenders commitments may be terminated and the lenders may foreclose on the collateral 
in addition  upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events of default  all amounts payable under the credit facility will automatically become due and payable and the lenders commitments will automatically terminate

table of contents distribution dividend policy 
host inc is required to distribute at least of its annual taxable income  excluding net capital gain  to its stockholders in order to maintain its qualification as a reit  including taxable income recognized for federal income tax purposes but with regard to which we do not receive cash 
funds used by host inc to pay dividends are provided through distributions from host lp as of february   host inc is the owner of approximately of the common op units 
the remaining of the common op units are held by various third party limited partners 
each op unit may be redeemed by the holders thereof for cash or  at the election of host inc  host inc common stock based on the then current conversion ratio 
the current conversion ratio is shares of host inc common stock for each op unit 
investors should take into account the non controlling position of host lp op units when analyzing dividend payments by host inc to its stockholders  as these holders share  on a pro rata basis  in amounts being distributed by host lp to holders of its corresponding op units 
for example  if host inc paid a per share dividend on its common stock  it would be based on the payment of a per common unit distribution by host lp to host inc  as well as to other common op unitholders 
host inc reinstated its quarterly common dividend payment and paid a per share dividend with respect to its common stock beginning in the first quarter of host inc s policy on common dividends is generally to distribute  over time  of its taxable income and to pay a dividend of at least per share per quarter even if we do not generate taxable income 
host inc intends to declare a dividend of per share in the first quarter of the amount of any future dividend will be determined by host inc s board of directors 
during  host inc s board of directors declared dividends of per share per share for each quarter on host inc s common stock 
accordingly  host lp made a distribution of per unit on its common op units 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations off balance sheet arrangements 
we are party to various transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements with unconsolidated entities which we refer to as off balance sheet arrangements under which we have certain contingent liabilities and guarantees 
as of december   we are party to the following material off balance sheet arrangements european joint venture 
in march  we formed a joint venture  hhr euro cv  to acquire hotels in europe 
we serve as the general partner for the european joint venture and have a ownership interest including our general and limited partner interests 
due to the ownership structure and unilateral right of the non host limited partners to cause the dissolution and liquidation of the european joint venture at any time  it is not consolidated in our financial statements 
our investment balance at december  in the joint venture is approximately million million 
the initial term of the european joint venture is ten years ending in  subject to two one year extensions with partner approval 
as of december   the aggregate size of the european joint venture was approximately billion billion  including total capital contributions of approximately million million  of which a total of approximately million million was primarily from our contribution of cash and the sheraton warsaw hotel towers 
under the joint venture s partnership agreement  the aggregate size can increase to approximately million of equity of which approximately million would be contributed by host lp and  once all funds have been invested  and including debt  would represent approximately billion of assets 
during  the partners amended and restated the agreement 
the amendments were i to extend the commitment period during which the european joint venture may make additional equity investments from may to may  ii to reflect an internal restructuring of one of our joint venture partners  and iii to reflect changes as a result of the acquisition of the equity interests of subsidiaries previously owned by a separate trs joint venture with the same partners  which subsidiaries currently lease  as tenant  five of the hotels owned by the european joint venture 
after the partnership agreement was amended  the separate trs joint venture was dissolved 

table of contents the partners are currently negotiating the terms of an expansion to the european joint venture  which would extend the term for another ten years and involve the commitment of million of new equity through the establishment of a fund of funds 
while the terms and structure of the expansion have not been finalized  it is anticipated that each of the current partners in the joint venture  including host  would own of a new sub fund as limited partners  and a host entity would own the remaining as the general partner 
we would anticipate transferring our leasehold interest in le m ridien piccadilly to the joint venture as part of the expansion 
the negotiations for the expansion of the european joint venture are ongoing and there can be no assurances that the terms  if completed  will not differ materially from those outlined above 
the european joint venture has million of mortgage debt  none of which is recourse to us 
in  we negotiated agreements with the lenders of a significant portion of this debt in order to cure actual or potential covenant defaults  cash sweeps or non payment defaults 
during the second quarter  the european joint venture completed an agreement with the lender holding mortgages totaling million on its portfolio of three hotels located in brussels  under which the lender waived all breaches of financial covenants 
additionally  during the third quarter  the european joint venture negotiated an agreement with the lenders of mortgage loans totaling million due in to amend the loans financial covenants for two years in exchange for a deposit of approximately million in escrow to fund debt service or  in certain cases  capital expenditures and commitments to fund planned incremental capital expenditures 
these loans are secured by a portfolio of six hotels located in spain  italy  poland and the united kingdom 
these mortgage loans are non recourse to us and a default under these loans does not trigger a default under any of our debt 
we have entered into four foreign currency forward purchase contracts in order to hedge the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment 
we hedged million approximately million of our investment and the forward purchase will occur between august and october during and  we recorded approximately million and million  respectively  related to the change in the fair value of the forward purchase contracts 
the current value of the forward contracts of million is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying balance sheet 
the derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation  and  in accordance with applicable hedge accounting guidance  are marked to market with changes in fair value recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within host inc s stockholders equity portion and host lp s partners capital portion of their balance sheets

on march   we entered into a joint venture  structured as a singapore corporation  to explore investment opportunities in various markets throughout asia  including china  japan  india  vietnam and australia 
we own a interest in the asian joint venture 
the initial term of the asian joint venture is for a period of seven years 
due to the ownership structure of the asian joint venture  and our partner s rights to cause its dissolution and liquidation at any time  it is not consolidated in our financial statements 
on july   the asian joint venture reached a joint venture agreement with accor s

the asian joint venture will invest approximately million to acquire approximately of the interest in the india joint venture 
the properties will be managed by accor under the pullman  novotel and ibis brands 
development of the properties is underway  and the first hotel  the ibis bangalore  is expected to open in the second quarter of hospitality properties trust relationship 
during  we owned leasehold interests in courtyard by marriott properties and residence inn by marriott properties  which hotels were sold to hpt and leased back to us in and in conjunction with our conversion to a reit we entered into subleases for these properties with a third party 
in late june  hpt sent notices of default because the subtenants failed to meet certain net worth covenants  which would have triggered an event of default by us under the master leases between us and hpt 
as a result  we terminated the subleases effective july  and resumed acting as owner under the management agreements 
the subtenants remain obligated to us for outstanding rent payments to the extent that operating cash generated by the hotels is less than rent that would have been paid under the terminated subleases  although they have not funded this obligation since the termination of the subleases 

table of contents effective upon termination of the subleases  we recorded the operations of the hotels rather than rental income for the remaining portion of as a result  we recorded million of hotel revenues for the properties  as well as million of rental income earned prior to the termination of the subleases in  which are included in other revenues on the consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  we recorded million of hotel expenses related to the properties  as well as million of rental expense due to hpt in  which are included in other property level expenses on the consolidated statements of operations 
the property revenues and rental income recorded  less the hotel expenses and rental expenses  resulted in a loss of approximately million and million in and  respectively  and a gain of million in we terminated the master lease on the residence inn properties in accordance with its terms effective december   at which time hpt paid us million of deferred proceeds related to the initial sale of these properties and additional amounts held in a tenant collection account 
on november   we gave notice that we will not extend the term of the master lease on the courtyard by marriott properties  which will result in the termination and expiration of that lease on december  at the expiration of that master lease  hpt is obligated to pay us deferred proceeds related to the initial sale of the courtyard properties of approximately million  subject to damages arising out of an event of default  if any  under the master lease  plus additional amounts held in a tenant collection account 
tax sharing arrangements 
under tax sharing agreements with former affiliated companies such as marriott international  inc  hms host and barcel crestline corporation  we are obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties relating to periods in which the companies were affiliated with us 
for example  a taxing authority could adjust an item deducted by a former affiliate during the period that this former affiliate was owned by us 
this adjustment could produce a tax liability that we may be obligated to pay under the tax sharing agreement 
additionally  under the partnership agreement between host inc and host lp  host lp is obligated to pay certain taxes federal  state  local and foreign  including any related interest and penalties incurred by host inc  as well as any liabilities the irs may successfully assert against host inc we do not expect any amounts paid under the tax sharing arrangements to be material 
tax indemnification agreements 
for reasons relating to federal and state income tax considerations of the former and current owners of three hotels  we have agreed to restrictions on selling the hotels  or repaying or refinancing the mortgage debt for varying periods depending on the hotel 
two of these agreements expired in and were not renewed and the third will expire in guarantees 
we have certain guarantees  which consist of commitments we have made to third parties for leases or debt  that are not on our books due to various dispositions  spin offs and contractual arrangements  but that we have agreed to pay in the event of certain circumstances including default by an unrelated party 
we consider the likelihood of any material payments under these guarantees to be remote 
the largest guarantees by dollar amount are listed below we remain contingently liable for rental payments on certain divested non lodging properties 
these primarily represent certain divested restaurants that were sold subject to our guarantee of the future rental payments 
the aggregate amount of these future rental payments is approximately million as of december  in  we owned leisure park venture limited partnership  which owns and operates a senior living facility 
we no longer have an ownership interest in the partnership  but we remain obligated under a guarantee of interest and principal with regard to million of municipal bonds issued by the new jersey economic development authority through their maturity in however  to the extent we are required to make any payments under the guarantee  we have been indemnified by barcel crestline corporation  who  in turn  is indemnified by the current owner of the facility 
in connection with the sale of two hotels in january  we remain contingently liable for the amounts due under the respective ground leases 
the future minimum lease payments are approximately million through the full term of the leases  including renewal options 
we believe that any liability related to these ground leases is remote  and in each case  we have been indemnified by the purchaser of the hotel 

table of contents information on other guarantees and other off balance sheet arrangements may be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations 
the table below summarizes our obligations for principal and estimated interest payments on our debt  future minimum lease payments on our operating and capital leases  projected capital expenditures and other long term liabilities  each as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year to years to years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet total the amounts shown include amortization of principal  debt maturities and estimated interest payments 
interest payments have been included in the long term debt obligations based on the weighted average interest rate 
our only purchase obligations consist of commitments for capital expenditures at our hotels 
under our contracts  we have the ability to defer some of these expenditures into later years 
the amounts shown include deferred management fees and the estimated amount of tax expense 
under terms of our management agreements  we have deferred payment of management fees to our hotel managers for some of our properties that have not achieved the required income thresholds for payment of owner s priority to us 
the timing of the payments  if any  is based on future operations  the termination of the management agreement or the sale of the hotel  and  is therefore  not determinable 
the estimated amount of tax expense relates to uncertain tax liabilities from prior years 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to the impairment of long lived assets  on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates 
purchase price allocations to hotels acquired in a business combination 
investments in hotel properties are stated at acquisition cost and allocated to land  property and equipment  identifiable intangible assets  other assets and assumed debt and other liabilities at fair value 
any remaining unallocated investment would be treated as goodwill 
property and equipment are recorded at fair value and allocated to buildings  improvements  furniture  fixtures and equipment using appraisals and valuations performed by management and independent third parties 
fair values are based on the exit price ie the price that would be received to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
we evaluate several factors  including market data for similar assets  expected cash flows discounted at risk adjusted rates and replacement cost for the assets  to determine an appropriate exit cost when evaluating the fair value of our assets 
other items that we evaluate in a business combination include identifiable intangible assets  capital lease assets and obligations and goodwill 
identifiable intangible assets are typically assumed contracts  including ground and retail leases and management and franchise agreements  which are recorded at fair value  although no value is generally allocated to contracts which are at market terms 
above market and below market contract values are 
table of contents based on the present value of the difference between contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the contracts acquired and our estimate of the fair value of contract rates for corresponding contracts measured over the period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the contract 
intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method over the remaining non cancelable term of the related agreements 
capital lease obligations that are assumed as a part of the acquisition of a leasehold interest are fair valued and included as debt on the accompanying balance sheet and we will record the corresponding right to use assets 
classification of a lease does not change if it is part of a business combination 
in making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price  we may utilize a number of sources that may be obtained in connection with the acquisition or financing of a property and other market data  including third party appraisals and valuations 
in certain situations  a deferred tax liability is created due to the difference between the fair value and the tax basis of the asset at the acquisition date  which also may result in a goodwill asset being recorded 
the goodwill that is recorded as a result of this difference is not subject to amortization 
furthermore  acquisition related costs  such as due diligence  legal and accounting fees  are not capitalized or applied in determining the fair value of the acquired assets 
impairment testing 
we analyze our assets for impairment throughout the year when events or circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying values thereof may not be recoverable 
we consider a property to be impaired when the sum of future undiscounted cash flows over our remaining estimated holding period is less than the carrying value of the asset 
for impaired assets  we record an impairment charge equal to the excess of the property s carrying value over its fair value 
to the extent that a property has a substantial remaining estimated useful life and management does not believe that it is more likely than not the property will be disposed of prior to the end of its useful life  it would be unusual for undiscounted cash flows to be insufficient to recover the property s carrying value 
in the absence of other factors  we assume that the estimated life is equal to the gaap depreciable life  because of the continuous property maintenance and improvement capital expenditures required under our management agreements 
we adjust our assumptions with respect to the remaining useful life of the property if situations dictate otherwise  such as an expiring ground lease  or it is more likely than not that the asset will be sold prior to its previously expected useful life 
we also consider the effect of regular renewal and replacement capital expenditures on the estimable life of our properties  including critical infrastructure  which is regularly maintained and then replaced at the end of its useful life 
we test for impairment in several situations  including when a property has a current or projected loss from operations  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life  or when other events  trends  contingencies or changes in circumstances indicate that a triggering event has occurred and an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable 
in the evaluation of the impairment of our assets  we make many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows  both from operations and the eventual disposition  expected useful life and holding period  future required capital expenditures  and fair values  including consideration of capitalization rates  discount rates and comparable selling prices 
while we consider all of the above indicators as a preliminary indicator to determine if the carrying value may not be recovered by undiscounted cash flows  we reviewed the actual year to date and the projected cash flows from operations to identify properties with actual or projected annual operating losses or minimal operating profit as of december  the projected cash flows are prepared by our third party managers and consider items such as booking pace  occupancy  room rate and property level operating costs 
we review the projections and may adjust them as we deem appropriate 
as a result of our review  we identified seven properties that required further consideration of property and market specific conditions or factors to determine if the property was impaired using an undiscounted cash flow analysis 
management considered a range of revpar and operating margins compared to prior years operating results in evaluating the projected cash flows from operations 
the operating results of our portfolio were significantly affected by the recessionary climate in and the first half of to appropriately evaluate if the assets carrying value was recoverable  we projected a growth rate such that the individual properties would return to normalized levels of operations within five years and thereafter grow at a stabilized rate of over the remaining estimable lives of the properties 
this stabilized growth rate is lower than the historical growth rate for the entire industry over the period from through based on this test  no properties exhibited an impaired value at december  for purposes of this test  if we had assumed a growth rate of after the return to normalized level of operations one of the seven properties identified above would have required further analysis 
management believes its assumptions and estimates reflect current market conditions 

table of contents other than temporary impairment of an investment 
we review our equity method investments for other than temporary impairment based on the occurrence of any triggering events that would indicate that the carrying amount of the investment exceeds its fair value on an other than temporary basis 
triggering events can include a decline in distributable cash flows from the investment  a change in the expected hold period or other significant events which would decrease the value of the investment 
our investments primarily consist of joint ventures which own hotel properties  therefore  we will generally have few observable inputs and will determine the fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis of the investment  as well as considering the impact of other elements ie control premiums  ie we use certain inputs  such as available third party appraisals and forecast net operating income for the hotel properties  to estimate the expected cash flows 
if an equity method investment is impaired  a loss is recorded for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the investment 
classification of assets as held for sale 
our policy for the classification of a hotel as held for sale is intended to ensure that the sale of the asset is probable prior to classifying it as such  will be completed within one year and that actions required to complete the sale are unlikely to change or that it is unlikely the planned sale will be withdrawn 
this policy is consistent with our experience with real estate transactions under which the timing and final terms of a sale are frequently not known until purchase agreements are executed  the buyer has a significant deposit at risk and no financing contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner 
specifically  we will typically classify properties that we are actively marketing as held for sale when all of the following conditions are met host inc s board of directors has approved the sale to the extent the dollar amount of the sale requires board approval  a binding agreement to purchase the property has been signed  the buyer has committed a significant amount of non refundable cash  and no significant contingencies exist which could prevent the transaction from being completed in a timely manner 
to the extent that a property is classified as held for sale and its fair value less selling costs is lower than the net book value of the property  we will record an impairment loss 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of our assets and amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
the lives of the assets are based on a number of assumptions  including cost and timing of capital expenditures to maintain and refurbish the assets  as well as specific market and economic conditions 
while management believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in the estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss or the gain or loss on the sale of any of our hotels 
valuation of deferred tax assets 
we have approximately million  net of a valuation allowance of million  of deferred tax assets as of december  the objective of financial accounting and reporting standards for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in a company s financial statements or tax returns 
we have considered various factors  including future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future projected taxable income and tax planning strategies in determining a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets  and we believe that it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the million of net deferred tax assets in the future 
when a determination is made that all  or a portion  of the deferred tax assets may not be realized  an increase in income tax expense would be recorded in that period 
valuation of derivative contracts 
we will occasionally enter into derivative products  including interest rate and foreign currency swaps  caps and collars 
derivative instruments are subject to fair value reporting at each reporting date and the increase or decrease in fair value is recorded in net income loss or accumulated other comprehensive income  based on the applicable hedge accounting guidance 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments through the use of third party valuations  which utilize the market standard methodology of netting the 
table of contents discounted future cash receipts and the discounted future expected cash payments 
we incorporate credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect both our own nonperformance risk and the respective counterparty s nonperformance risk in the fair value measurements 
in adjusting the fair value of our derivative contracts for the effect of nonperformance risk  we have considered the impact of netting any applicable credit enhancements  such as collateral postings  thresholds  mutual puts and guarantees 
the variable cash flow streams are based on an expectation of future interest and exchange rates derived from observed market interest and exchange rate curves 
the values of these instruments will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
any event that impacts the level of actual and expected future interest or exchange rates will impact our valuations 
the fair value of our derivatives is likely to fluctuate from year to year based on changing levels of interest and exchange rates and shortening terms to maturity 
stock compensation 
we recognize costs resulting from host inc s share based payment transactions over their vesting periods 
we classify share based payment awards granted in exchange for employee services as either equity awards or liability awards 
the classification of host inc s restricted stock awards as either an equity award or a liability award is based upon cash settlement options 
equity classified awards are measured based on the fair value on the date of grant 
liability classified awards are remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
these awards were classified as liability awards due to settlement features that allow the recipient to have a percentage of the restricted stock awards withheld to meet tax withholding requirements 
the value of these restricted stock awards  less estimated forfeitures  is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period usually the vesting period 
no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which employees do not render the requisite service 
during  host inc implemented an employee stock plan for our senior management that included the following awards restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions 
these awards vest based on the total shareholder return relative to other reits and lodging companies 
they are classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement features and are remeasured to fair value each reporting period 
we utilize a simulation  or monte carlo model  to determine the fair value of host inc s restricted stock awards with vesting based on market conditions 
the utilization of this model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of host inc s common stock  risk free interest rates  the risk profile of our common shares compared to our peer group and the amount of host inc s awards expected to be forfeited 
restricted stock awards with vesting based on performance conditions 
these awards are earned based on the employee achieving a specified performance target  which will be based on the employee s specific management business objectives 
compensation cost will be recognized when the achievement of the performance condition is considered probable of achievement 
if a performance condition has more than one outcome that is probable of achievement  recognition of compensation cost will be based on the condition that is the most likely outcome 
these awards classified as liability awards due to their cash settlement provisions 
therefore  the value of the shares to be issued by host inc will be based on host inc 
s share price on the reporting date 
stock option awards 
the stock option awards are equity classified awards  as they do not include cash settlement features 
therefore  the value of the award is determined on the grant date using a binomial pricing model and is not adjusted for future changes in the fair value 
vesting for these awards is based on service conditions 
the utilization of the binomial model requires us to make certain estimates related to the volatility of the share price of our common stock  risk free interest rates and the amount of our awards expected to be forfeited 
other awards 
during  host inc granted restricted stock awards to all of its employees  with vesting based on service conditions 
these awards are equity classified awards as they do not have cash settlement features similar to that for awards to senior management 
consolidation policies 
judgment is required with respect to the consolidation of partnership and joint venture entities in terms of the evaluation of control  including assessment of the importance of rights and privileges of the partners based on voting rights  as well as financial interests that are not controllable through voting interests 
we consolidate subsidiaries when we have the ability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity 
for those partnerships and joint ventures of which we are the general partner  
table of contents we review the rights of the limited partners to determine if those rights would preclude the assumption of control as the general partner 
limited partner rights which would preclude presumption of control by the general partner include the substantive ability to dissolve liquidate the limited partnership or otherwise remove us  as the general partner  without cause and substantive participating rights  primarily through voting rights 
we also evaluate our subsidiaries to determine if they should be considered variable interest entities vies 
if a subsidiary is a vie  it is subject to the consolidation framework specifically for vies 
we consider an entity a vie if equity investors own an interest therein that does not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or if such investors do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
in accordance with asc  we reviewed our subsidiaries to determine if i any of our subsidiaries or affiliates should be considered vies  and ii whether we should change our consolidation determination based on changes in the characteristics of these entities 
foreign currency translation 
the operations of foreign subsidiaries are maintained in their functional currency  which is generally the local currency  and then translated to us dollars using the average exchange rates for the period 
the assets and liabilities are translated to us dollars using the exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
foreign currency transactions are recorded in the functional currency for each entity using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at period end exchange rates 
the resulting exchange differences on translation are recorded in gain loss on foreign currency transactions and derivatives  except when deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income as qualifying net investment hedges 
comparable hotel operating statistics we present certain operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and operating results revenues  expenses and adjusted operating profit for the periods included in this report on a comparable hotel basis 
we define our comparable hotels as properties i that are owned or leased by us and the operations of which are included in our consolidated results  whether as continuing operations or discontinued operations for the entirety of the reporting periods being compared  and ii that have not sustained substantial property damage or business interruption  or undergone large scale capital projects during the reporting periods being compared 
of the hotels that we owned on december   have been classified as comparable hotels 
the operating results of the following hotels that we owned or leased as of december  are excluded from comparable hotel results for these periods le m ridien piccadilly acquired leasehold interest in july  westin chicago river north acquired in august  w new york  union square acquired in september  jw marriott  rio de janeiro acquired in september  san diego marriott hotel marina business disruption due to significant renovations  and courtyard by marriott properties leased from hpt sublease was terminated in july 
the operating results of the eight hotels we disposed of in and  as well as residence inn properties we leased from hpt until december  are not included in comparable hotel results for the periods presented herein 
moreover  because these statistics and operating results are for our hotel properties  they exclude results for our non hotel properties and other real estate investments 
we evaluate the operating performance of our comparable hotels based on both geographic region and property type 
these divisions are generally consistent with groupings recognized in the lodging industry 

table of contents geographic regions consist of the following only states in which we own hotels are listed pacific california  hawaii  oregon and washington  mountain arizona and colorado  north central illinois  indiana  minnesota  missouri and ohio  south central louisiana  tennessee and texas  new england connecticut  massachusetts and new hampshire  mid atlantic pennsylvania  new jersey and new york  dc metro maryland  virginia and washington  dc  atlanta georgia and north carolina  florida florida  and international brazil  canada  chile  mexico  new zealand and the united kingdom 
property types consist of the following urban hotels located in primary business districts of major cities  suburban hotels located in office parks or smaller secondary markets  resort conference hotels located in resort conference destinations such as arizona  florida  hawaii and southern california  and airport hotels located at or near airports 
reporting periods 
for consolidated statement of operations 
the results we report are based on results of our hotels reported to us by our hotel managers 
our hotel managers use different reporting periods 
marriott  the manager of a significant percentage of our properties  uses a year ending on the friday closest to december and reports twelve weeks of operations for the first three quarters and sixteen or seventeen weeks for the fourth quarter of the year for its us and canadian marriott managed hotels 
in contrast  other managers of our hotels  such as hyatt and starwood  report results on a monthly basis 
host inc  as a reit  is required by federal income tax law to report results on a calendar year basis 
as a result  we elected to adopt the reporting periods used by marriott  modified so that our fiscal year always ends on december to comply with reit rules 
our first three quarters of operations end on the same day as marriott  but our fourth quarter ends on december and our full year results  as reported in our statement of operations  always includes the same number of days as the calendar year 
two consequences of the reporting cycle we have adopted are quarterly start dates will usually differ between years  except for the first quarter which always commences on january  and our first and fourth quarters of operations and year to date operations may not include the same number of days as reflected in prior years 
for example  set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates for  and note that the second and third quarters of each year both reflect twelve weeks of operations 
in contrast  the first and fourth quarters reflect differing days of operations 
start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days start end dates no 
of days first quarter january march january march january march second quarter march june march june march june third quarter june september june september june september fourth quarter september december september december september december while the reporting calendar we adopted is more closely aligned with the reporting calendar used by marriott  another consequence of our calendar is that we are unable to report the month of operations that ends after our fiscal quarter end until the following quarter because our hotel managers that use a monthly reporting period do not make mid month results available to us 
hence  the month of operation that ends after our fiscal quarter end is included in our quarterly results of operations in the following quarter for those hotel managers covering approximately of total revenues of our hotels 
as a result  our quarterly results of operations include results from hotel managers 
table of contents reporting results on a monthly basis as follows first quarter january  february  second quarter march to may  third quarter june to august and fourth quarter september to december 
while this does not affect full year results  it does affect the reporting of quarterly results 
for hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results 
in contrast to the reporting periods for our consolidated statement of operations  our hotel operating statistics ie  revpar  average daily rate and average occupancy and our comparable hotel results are reported based on the reporting cycle used by marriott for our marriott managed hotels 
this facilitates year to year comparisons  as each reporting period will be comprised of the same number of days of operations as in the prior year 
this means  however  that the reporting periods we use for hotel operating statistics and our comparable hotel results will typically differ slightly from the reporting periods used for our statements of operations for the first and fourth quarters and the full year 
set forth below are the quarterly start and end dates that are used for our hotel operating statistics and comparable hotel results reported herein 
results from hotel managers reporting on a monthly basis are included in our operating statistics and comparable hotel results consistent with their reporting in our consolidated statement of operations

these measures are as follows i ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp  ii funds from operations ffo and ffo per diluted share  as a measure of performance for host inc  and iii comparable hotel operating results  as a measure of performance for host inc and host lp the following discussion defines these terms and presents why we believe they are useful measures of our performance 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda 
ebitda earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda is a commonly used measure of performance in many industries 
management believes ebitda provides useful information to investors regarding our results of operations because it helps us and our investors evaluate the ongoing operating performance of our properties and facilitates comparisons between us and other lodging reits  hotel owners who are not reits and other capital intensive companies 
management uses ebitda to evaluate property level results and as one measure in determining the value of acquisitions and dispositions and  like ffo per diluted share  it is widely used by management in the annual budget process 
adjusted ebitda historically  management has adjusted ebitda when evaluating host inc and host lp performance because we believe that the exclusion of certain additional recurring and non recurring items described below provides useful supplemental information to investors regarding our ongoing operating performance and that the presentation of adjusted ebitda  when combined with the primary gaap presentation of net income  is beneficial to an investor s complete understanding of our operating performance and is a relevant measure in calculating certain credit ratios 
we adjust ebitda for the following items  which may occur in any period  and refer to this measure as adjusted ebitda real estate transactions we exclude the effect of gains and losses  including the amortization of deferred gains  recorded on the disposition of assets and property insurance gains in our consolidated statement of operations because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets 
in addition  material gains or losses from the depreciated value of the disposed assets could be less important to investors given that the depreciated asset often does not reflect the market value of real estate assets as noted below for ffo 

table of contents equity investment adjustments we exclude the equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated investments in partnerships and joint ventures as presented in our consolidated statement of operations because it includes our pro rata portion of depreciation  amortization and interest expense 
we include our pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our equity investments as we believe this more accurately reflects the performance of our investment 
the pro rata adjusted ebitda of equity investments is defined as the ebitda of our equity investments adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by our percentage ownership in the partnership or joint venture 
consolidated partnership adjustments we deduct the non controlling partners pro rata share of the adjusted ebitda of our consolidated partnerships as this reflects the non controlling owners interest in the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships 
the pro rata adjusted ebitda of non controlling partners is defined as the ebitda of our consolidated partnerships adjusted for any gains or losses on property transactions multiplied by the non controlling partners positions in the partnership or joint venture 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle infrequently  the financial accounting standards board fasb promulgates new accounting standards that require the consolidated statement of operations to reflect the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we exclude these one time adjustments because they do not reflect our actual performance for that period 
impairment losses we exclude the effect of impairment losses recorded because we believe that including them in adjusted ebitda is not consistent with reflecting the ongoing performance of our remaining assets 
in addition  we believe that impairment charges are similar to gains losses on dispositions and depreciation expense  both of which are also excluded from ebitda 
acquisition costs effective january   the accounting treatment under gaap for costs associated with completed property acquisitions changed and these costs are now expensed in the year incurred as opposed to capitalized as part of the acquisition 
beginning in  we will exclude the effect of these costs because we believe that including them is not reflective of the ongoing performance of our properties 
this is consistent with the ebitda calculation under the prior gaap accounting treatment which expensed these costs over time as part of depreciation expense  which is excluded from ebitda 
ebitda and adjusted ebitda  as presented  may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from operations or any other operating performance measure calculated in accordance with gaap 
cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures  interest expense and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ebitda and adjusted ebitda presentations 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows include interest expense  capital expenditures  and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
additionally  ebitda and adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions

b adjusted ebitda was significantly affected in by million of costs incurred related to successful acquisitions 
prior to  the costs were capitalized as part of the acquisition 
these costs are now expensed and deducted from net income and adjusted ebitda 
for  the accrual for a potential litigation settlement decreased adjusted ebitda by million 
ffo and ffo per diluted share 
we present ffo and ffo per diluted share as a non gaap measure of host inc performance in addition to our earnings per share calculated in accordance with gaap 
we calculate ffo per diluted share for a given operating period as our ffo for such period divided by the number of fully diluted shares outstanding during such period 
nareit defines ffo as net income calculated in accordance with gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles  real estate related depreciation and amortization and adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented on a per share basis after making adjustments for the effects of dilutive securities  including the payment of preferred stock dividends  in accordance with nareit guidelines 
we believe that ffo per diluted share is a useful supplemental measure of host inc operating performance and that presentation of ffo per diluted share  when combined with the primary gaap presentation of earnings per share  provides beneficial information to investors 
by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation  amortization and gains and losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical cost accounting and which may be of lesser significance in evaluating current performance  we believe that such a measure can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and between other reits  even though ffo per diluted share does not represent an amount that accrues directly to holders of host inc s common stock 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted by nareit in its april white paper on funds from operations  since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
for these reasons  nareit adopted the definition of ffo in order to promote an industry wide measure of reit operating performance 
we calculate ffo per diluted share  in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to measures calculated by other companies who do not use the nareit definition of ffo or calculate ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit guidance 
in addition  although ffo per diluted share is a useful measure when comparing our results to other reits  it may not be helpful to investors when comparing us to non reits 
this information should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating profit  cash from 
table of contents operations  or any other operating performance measure prescribed by gaap 
cash expenditures for various long term assets such as renewal and replacement capital expenditures and other items have been and will be incurred and are not reflected in the ffo per diluted share presentations 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows include depreciation  capital expenditures and other excluded items  all of which should be considered when evaluating our performance  as well as the usefulness of our non gaap financial measures 
additionally  ffo per diluted share should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity or indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make cash distributions 
in addition  ffo per diluted share does not measure  and should not be used as a measure of  amounts that accrue directly to host inc s stockholders benefit

b earnings loss per diluted share and ffo per diluted share in accordance with nareit are adjusted for the effects of dilutive securities 
dilutive securities may include host inc shares granted under host inc s comprehensive stock plans  preferred op units held by non controlling partners  exchangeable debt securities and other non controlling interests that have the option to convert their limited partnership interest to common op units 
no effect is shown for securities if they are anti dilutive

represents the portion of the significant items attributable to non controlling partners of host lp comparable hotel operating results 
we present certain operating results for our hotels  such as hotel revenues  expenses  and adjusted operating profit  on a comparable hotel  or same store basis as supplemental information for investors of both host inc and host lp we present these comparable hotel operating results by eliminating corporate level costs and expenses related to our capital structure  as well as depreciation and amortization 
we eliminate corporate level costs and expenses because we believe property level results provide investors with more specific insight into the ongoing operating performance of our hotels 
we eliminate depreciation and amortization  because even though depreciation and amortization are property level expenses  these non cash expenses  which are based on historical cost accounting for real estate assets  implicitly assume that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
as noted earlier  because real estate values historically have risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
as a result of the elimination of corporate level costs and expenses and depreciation and amortization  the comparable hotel operating results we present do not represent our total revenues  expenses or operating profit and these comparable hotel operating results should not be used to evaluate our performance as a whole 
management compensates for these limitations by separately considering the impact of these excluded items to the extent they are material to operating decisions or assessments of our operating performance 
our consolidated statements of operations include such amounts  all of which should be considered by investors when evaluating our performance 
we present these hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis because we believe that doing so provides investors and management with useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
in particular  these measures assist management and investors in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to growth or decline of operations at comparable hotels which represent the vast majority of our portfolio or from other factors  such as the effect of acquisitions or dispositions 
while management believes that presentation of comparable hotel results is a same store supplemental measure that provides useful information in evaluating our ongoing performance  this measure is not used to allocate resources or assess the operating performance of these hotels  as these decisions are based on data for individual hotels and are not based on comparable portfolio hotel results 
for these reasons  we believe that comparable hotel operating results  when combined with the presentation of gaap operating profit  revenues and expenses  provide useful information to investors and management

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all information in this section applies to host inc and host lp interest rate sensitivity our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we have no derivative financial instruments held for trading purposes 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks 
our interest payments on of our debt are fixed in nature this percentage does not include million of mortgage debt for which we have swapped fixed interest payments for floating interest payments  which largely mitigates the effect of changes in interest rates on our cash interest payments 
valuations for mortgage debt and the credit facility are determined based on the expected future payments  discounted at risk adjusted rates 
the senior notes and the debentures are valued based on quoted market prices 
if market rates of interest on our variable rate debt increase or decrease by basis points  interest expense would increase or decrease  respectively  our future earnings and cash flows by approximately million in the table below presents scheduled maturities and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
expected maturity date thereafter total fair value in millions liabilities debt fixed rate average interest rate variable rate variable rate average interest rate total debt interest rate derivative interest rate swaps fixed to variable average pay rate average receive rate the amounts are net of unamortized discounts and premiums 
the interest rate for our floating rate payments is based on the rate in effect as of december  no adjustments are made for forecasted changes in the rate 
fair value interest rate swap derivatives 
we currently have three interest rate swap agreements for an aggregate notional amount of million related to the ritz carlton  naples and newport beach marriott hotel spa mortgage loan in the amount of million 
we entered into the derivative instruments to hedge changes in the fair value of the fixed rate mortgage that occur as a result of changes in the month libor rate 
as a result  we will pay a floating interest rate equal to the month libor  plus a spread which ranges from to  as opposed to the fixed rate of  on the notional amount of million through march  during and  the cash settlement received under the swap agreement decreased interest expense by million and million  respectively 

table of contents we have designated these derivatives as fair value hedges 
the derivatives are valued based on the prevailing market yield curve on the date of measurement 
if we were to increase the interest rates from the prevailing market yield curve  which for our reverse swaps is month libor  by at december   then the fair value of the swap would decrease million 
similarly  if we were to decrease the interest rates from the prevailing market yield curve by at december   then the fair value of the swap would increase by million 
we also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps 
as of december   we recorded an asset of million related to the fair value of the swaps 
the change in the fair value of the derivative is largely offset by the corresponding change in the fair value of the underlying debt due to change in the month libor rate  which is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the debt 
any difference between the change in the fair value of the swap and the change in the fair value in the underlying debt  which was not significant for the periods presented  is considered the ineffective portion of the hedging relationship and is recorded in net income loss 
exchange rate sensitivity as we have non us operations specifically  the ownership of hotels in canada  chile  mexico  brazil  the united kingdom and new zealand and an investment in our european joint venture  currency exchange risk arises as a normal part of our business 
to manage the currency exchange risk applicable to ownership in non us hotels  where possible  we may enter into forward or option contracts 
the foreign currency exchange agreements that we have entered into were strictly to hedge foreign currency risk and not for trading purposes 
during and  we entered into four foreign currency forward purchase contracts totaling million approximately million to hedge a portion of the foreign currency exposure resulting from the eventual repatriation of our net investment in the european joint venture 
pursuant to these transactions  we will sell the euro amount  and receive the us dollar amount on the forward purchase date 
these derivatives are considered a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a net investment in a foreign operation and are marked to market with changes in fair value and recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income within host inc s equity portion and host lp s capital portion of their balance sheets 
we also evaluate counterparty credit risk in the calculation of the fair value of the swaps
