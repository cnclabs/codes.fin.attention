as used in this md a  the terms we  us  our and the company mean scientific games corporation together with its consolidated subsidiaries 
overview introduction we are a leading global supplier of products and services to lotteries and a leading provider of gaming technology and content to other gaming operators worldwide 
we also gain access to technology and pursue global expansion through strategic joint ventures and minority equity investments 
we report our operations in three business segments printed products group  lottery systems group  and diversified gaming group 
our revenue is segregated into three categories instant ticket revenue  service revenue and sales revenue 
instant ticket revenue includes revenue related to our instant ticket fulfillment services businesses  including our mdi business 
revenue generated from our lottery systems business including revenue from the validation of instant tickets  our wide area gaming business and the legacy racing business is categorized as service revenue 
revenue generated from our sales of lottery systems and terminals and phone cards  which are typically non recurring in nature and not subject to multi year supply agreements  is categorized as sales revenue 
for the year ended december   we derived approximately of our revenue from our customers outside of the us and were affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the foreign currencies to which we are most exposed are the british pound sterling and euro 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations increased our revenues by approximately million in the year ended december  the discussion below highlights certain known trends  demands  commitments  events and uncertainties that have affected our recent financial and operating performance and or may affect our future financial and operating performance in our three business segments 
printed products group our printed products group is primarily comprised of our global instant ticket and related services businesses  which include ticket design and manufacturing as well as value added services such as game design  sales and marketing support  specialty games and promotions  inventory management and warehousing and fulfillment services 
we also provide lotteries with cooperative service partnerships  or csps  under which we provide an extended suite of services to help our customers efficiently and effectively manage their operations to achieve higher profitability 
the printed products group includes mdi  a leading provider of licensed games  promotional entertainment and internet services to the lottery industry 
the printed products group also includes our interest in lns  our joint venture that holds the concession to operate the gratta e vinci instant ticket lottery in italy  our interest in northstar  our joint venture that was awarded the private management agreement for the illinois lottery in executed in january and our interest in csg  our instant ticket printing joint venture in china 
see note equity investments in joint ventures to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our equity interest in lns and its predecessor  cln  northstar and csg 
based on third party data  our customers total instant ticket lottery retail sales in the us increased approximately in compared to the prior year due in part to the launch of new instant ticket lotteries in arkansas and puerto rico in late we believe we are likely to continue to experience a highly competitive procurement environment for instant ticket contracts  which could lead to further contract rate reductions and or additional service requirements in connection with re bids  extensions and renewals of our domestic and international instant ticket and csp contracts 
in  a number of us instant ticket and csp contracts are due to come up for re bid 
see the table in business contract procurement in item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding the scheduled expiration dates of our us lottery contracts 
our strategy to counter balance these industry trends includes working with our lottery customers to grow their sales through a variety of methods including launching new products  implementing innovative marketing tools and expanding retail distribution 
see business company strategy in item of this annual report on form k 
our lns joint venture as successor to our cln joint venture commenced operations under the new concession to operate the italian instant ticket lottery on october  under the new concession  we are the primary supplier of instant lottery tickets for the joint venture  as we were under the prior concession 
in the fourth quarter of  we supplied approximately of the total instant tickets supplied to lns  which was approximately less than the volume that we supplied to cln in recent years 
over the life of the new concession  we expect that we will supply no less than of lns instant ticket requirements 
in october  we paid to lns the final of two upfront payments associated with the new concession 
the upfront fees associated with the new concession will be amortized by lns anticipated to be approximately million per year of the new concession  which will reduce our equity in earnings of joint ventures 
our share of the amortization is expected to be approximately million per year on a pre tax basis 
in light of the corporate structure of lns  under applicable accounting rules  we will record our equity in earnings of lns on an after tax basis  which will impact the comparability of our results of operations from our italian joint venture since we recorded our equity in earnings of cln on a pre tax basis 
retail sales of the italian instant ticket lottery have improved from approximately million per week at the commencement of our joint venture operations in to approximately million per week during however  retail sales of instant tickets in italy during declined by approximately  which we believe was due in part to the uncertainty relating to the results of the tender process for the new concession to operate the italian instant ticket lottery 
now that the uncertainty regarding the tender process is over  we believe that lns will be able to devote more time and attention to executing its marketing and retail expansion strategies 
we saw the early success of these strategies in the fourth quarter of as retail sales rebounded approximately year over year 
our northstar joint venture  in which we are a equity holder  was awarded the agreement to be the private manager for the illinois lottery for a ten year term following a competitive procurement  which agreement was executed on january  the pma 
as the private manager  northstar will  subject to the oversight of the illinois lottery  manage the day to day operations of the lottery including lottery game development and portfolio management  retailer recruitment and training  supply of goods and services and overall marketing strategy 
see business operational overview printed products northstar lottery group in item of this annual report on form k 
operations under the pma are scheduled to commence in following a transition period 
on january   the illinois appellate court upheld a constitutional challenge to the revenue statute that  among other things  amended the lottery law to facilitate the pma  on grounds that the statute impermissibly addressed more than one subject 
the illinois supreme court subsequently granted a stay of the appellate court decision pending the appeal to the illinois supreme court by the state of illinois 
we cannot predict what effect  if any  the court decision  if it is not reversed by the illinois supreme court or addressed through new authorizing legislation  will have on the validity of the pma 
if the pma is ultimately invalidated  we may lose our investment in northstar and our existing instant ticket supply agreement with the illinois lottery may come up for re bid 
lottery systems group our lottery systems group provides customized computer software  software support  equipment and data communication services to lotteries 
the lottery systems group also provides lotteries with transaction processing software for the accounting and validation of both instant and online lottery games  point of sale terminals  vlts  central site computers  communications technology  and ongoing support and maintenance for these products 
we are also the exclusive instant ticket validation network provider to the china sports lottery 
the lottery systems group also includes our interest in guard libang 
see note equity investments in joint ventures to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our equity interest in guard libang 
based on third party data  lottery systems customers retail sales in the us decreased approximately in compared to our lottery systems group has been subject to the same intense price based competition to which our printed products group is subject 
lottery systems group revenue decreased in compared to reflecting the loss of a number of our lottery contracts or renewal at less favorable pricing terms and or with increased product and service requirements 
since late  the lotteries in south carolina  west virginia  south dakota  new hampshire and vermont awarded new online lottery contracts to other vendors 
our online lottery contracts with south carolina  west virginia and south dakota terminated on november   june  and august   respectively  and our online lottery contracts with new hampshire and vermont each terminated on june  during  the lottery authority in maine awarded a new online lottery contract to one of our competitors  which award was subsequently invalidated as a result of our protest 
the competitor has appealed the protest ruling 
although we believe that the appeal will be denied and that  during the appeal  maine will extend our existing contract and issue a revised rfp  there can be no assurance that the appeal will be denied  that our existing contract will be extended or that we will be the winning bidder under any reissued rfp 
during  the indiana lottery awarded us an online lottery contract that began in in  we were awarded the lottery systems contract in iowa  which is scheduled to commence in july in early  us lotteries began cross selling the multi state powerball and mega millions lottery games  enabling players in many lottery states to play a big jackpot game four days a week 
going forward  we believe that lottery directors are considering differentiating price points for these two games  as well as potentially launching a new game at a price point 
we believe that such initiatives  if implemented  would likely result in higher retail sales in the us lottery systems business 
we have recently seen an increase in bidding opportunities to provide central monitoring and control systems for video gaming networks  particularly in jurisdictions in north america  as these jurisdictions pursue vlts as an opportunity to address budget deficits 
we believe that this could be an attractive growth opportunity for the company in the coming years 
in china  instant ticket retail sales of the china sports lottery increased approximately in compared to the year over year increase was less than anticipated due in part to increased competition from the cwl  including its ability to increase the average sales price of its tickets  and its exclusive right to sell instant tickets at the shanghai world expo from may through october we also experienced increased competition from sports wagering games during the world cup in we are focused on accelerating growth of our business through higher price point instant tickets  expansion of the retailer and validation network  the introduction of tickets with licensed brands  the pursuit of additional distribution channels eg  mobile phones and the launch of an advertising campaign to build brand awareness 
given the performance in china relative to our expectations  we have recently devoted more senior management time and personnel to better capitalize on the opportunities in china 
the rate we receive on retail sales under our china instant ticket validation contract decreased by in january and is scheduled to decrease by an additional in january and an additional in january to the extent we are not able to offset these rate reductions by retail sales growth  our revenue and gross margin from this contract will be adversely affected 
diversified gaming group our diversified gaming group provides services and systems to private and public operators in the wide area gaming industry  including server based gaming machines 
the diversified gaming group includes global draw  a leading supplier of wide area gaming machines  server based gaming systems and game content to licensed bookmakers primarily in betting shops in the uk  and games media  a supplier of gaming terminals and content to uk pub operators 
the diversified gaming group also includes our equity interests in rcn  sportech and sciplay 
see note equity investments in joint ventures to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our equity interests in rcn  sportech and sciplay 
the diversified gaming group included the racing business prior to its sale on october  to sportech 
upon the closing of the transaction  we received approximately million in cash and million ordinary shares of sportech stock the consideration shares  representing approximately of the outstanding shares of sportech as of the closing of the transaction 
the consideration shares were valued at approximately million based on the closing price of sportech stock on october  sportech also agreed to make an additional cash payment to us on september  of approximately million 
in addition  if the racing business under sportech ownership achieves certain performance targets over the three year period following the closing of the transaction  we will be entitled to an additional cash payment of up to million 
due to the company continued involvement with sportech  including our equity interest in sportech  the disposal of the racing business did not qualify as discontinued operations and was not reflected as such in our consolidated statement of operations 
going forward  our interest in sportech will be accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
the comparability of our results of operations during will be affected by the sale of the racing business 
in  global draw was awarded a four year contract to supply approximately  server based gaming machines to ladbrokes  which we believe represents approximately of its terminal base 
the contract award is the largest in global draw history 
global draw is in the process of migrating its server based gaming machines to a new state of the art software platform technology  and rolling out this new technology to all of its customers in the uk critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
as described below  the determination of when to recognize revenue for certain revenue transactions requires judgment 
revenue from licensed branded property coupled with a service component whereby we purchase and distribute merchandise prizes on behalf of the lottery authorities to identified winners is recognized on a proportional performance method as this method best reflects the pattern in which the obligations to the customer are fulfilled 
a performance measure is used based on total estimated cost allocated to a specific contract 
by accumulating costs for services as they are incurred  and dividing such costs by the total contract costs which is estimated based on a budget prior to contract inception  a percentage is determined 
the percentage determined is applied to the total fixed price of the contract and that proportionate amount of revenue is recognized on a monthly basis 
revenue from the sale of lottery systems that require the production and delivery of terminals and customized software is recognized using the cost to cost measure of the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the percentage of completion method recognizes income as work on a contract progresses 
the use of the percentage of completion method depends on our ability to make reasonably dependable cost estimates for the design  manufacture  and delivery of our products 
estimation of these costs requires the use of judgment 
revenues under percentage of completion contracts are recorded as costs are incurred 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost for stock awards at fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the estimation of stock based awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment and  to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
actual results and future changes in estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates 
we may grant certain stock based awards that are contingent upon the company achieving certain financial performance targets 
upon determining the performance target is probable  the fair value of the award is recognized over the service period 
certain stock based awards may be settled in cash or a variable number of shares 
the fair value of these awards is measured each reporting period and recorded as a liability and corresponding compensation expense 
as the fair value changes each reporting period  the corresponding liability and compensation expense are adjusted  such that the liability and cumulative compensation expense equal the total fair value of the obligation upon the reporting date 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill we assess the recoverability of long lived assets and intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical performance or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant adverse change in the legality of our business ventures or the business climate in which we operate  and loss of a significant customer 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying value of each reporting unit to its fair value using a two step impairment test 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
when we determine that the carrying value of the long lived assets  intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow or by a comparison to third party indications of fair market value 
the estimate of a reporting unit fair value requires the use of assumptions and estimates regarding the reporting unit future cash flows  growth rates and weighted average cost of capital 
any significant adverse changes in key assumptions about these businesses and their prospects or an adverse change in market conditions may cause a change in the estimation of fair value and could result in an impairment charge 
given the significance of goodwill  an adverse change to the estimated fair value could result in an impairment charge that could be material to our financial statements 
significant judgment is required in the forecasting of future operating results  which are used in the preparation of projected cash flows 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and products  it is possible that forecasts used to support our goodwill may change in the future  which could result in significant non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations 
income taxes and deferred income taxes income taxes are determined using the liability method of accounting for income taxes 
the company tax expense includes the us and international income taxes but excludes the provision for us taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries deemed to be permanently invested 
the company applies a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the company recognizes in the financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year 
the tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized 
the company establishes a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely 
at december   the company has a valuation allowance of million recorded against the benefit of certain deferred tax assets of foreign and domestic subsidiaries 
until we determine that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize our deferred income tax assets  us income tax benefits associated with current period losses will be fully reserved 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and in the normal course of business is examined in various jurisdictions 
the reversal of the accruals is recorded when examinations are completed  statutes of limitation are closed or tax laws are changed

the purchase and redemption of the notes was funded with the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes

on december   we entered into an amendment to the credit agreement 
under the amendment  the acquisition of any specified percentage of the company common stock by macandrews forbes holdings inc m f and or certain related parties will not constitute an event of default under the credit agreement 
in addition  the occurrence of a change of control under certain other indebtedness of the company or sgi as a result of the acquisition of any specified percentage of the company common stock by m f and or certain related parties will not constitute an event of default under the credit agreement  provided that sgi or any guarantor under the credit agreement would at such time be permitted under the terms of the credit agreement to repay any such indebtedness that becomes due and payable as a result of such acquisition 
as of december   we had approximately million available for additional borrowing or letter of credit issuances under our revolving credit facility under the credit agreement 
there were no borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit under our revolving credit facility as of december  our ability to borrow under the credit agreement will depend on us remaining in compliance with the limitations imposed by our lenders  including the maintenance of our financial ratios and covenants 
on may   the members of cln  our consortium that operated the gratta e vinci instant ticket lottery in italy since  were awarded a new concession to operate the instant ticket lottery upon the termination of cln concession on september  our bidding group formed and capitalized a new vehicle  lns  to hold the concession 
lns was responsible for upfront fees associated with the new concession totaling million  which lns paid to the italian monopoli di stato in we were responsible for our pro rata share of this amount  or million  of which million was paid in the second quarter of and million was paid in the fourth quarter of we incurred additional debt in and and entered into amendments to our credit agreement in february in part to provide us with sufficient liquidity to make these upfront payments 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments principally include obligations associated with our outstanding indebtedness  contractual purchase obligations and future minimum operating lease obligations  as set forth in the table below as of december  cash payments due by period in thousands total within year within years within years after years long term debt  notes long term debt  notes long term debt  notes long term debt  term loan global draw promissory notes unsecured borrowings denominated in rmb other long term debt interest expense contractual purchase obligations operating leases other liabilities total contractual obligations see note long term and other debt to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding long term and other debt 
based on rates in effect at december  includes  among other obligations  obligations and or capital commitments in connection with our lottery systems contracts  global draw ladbrokes contract and the contract with the china sports lottery 
see note leases to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding our operating leases 
we have excluded approximately million of long term pension plan and other post retirement liabilities  deferred compensation liabilities of approximately million  serp liability of million and the liability for uncertain tax positions of million at december  due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with these liabilities  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period in which these liabilities might be paid 
our online lottery systems service contracts require us to  among other things  maintain the central computing system and related hardware in efficient working order  provide added software functionality upon request  provide on site computer operators  and furnish necessary supplies 
historically  the revenues we derive from our lottery systems service contracts have generally exceeded the direct costs associated with fulfilling our obligations thereunder 
in addition  through advancements in technology  we are periodically deploying more efficient and cost effective methods for manufacturing and delivering our products and services to our customers 
we expect that technological efficiencies will continue to positively impact our operating results 
periodically  we bid on new online lottery contracts 
once awarded  these contracts generally require significant upfront capital expenditures for terminal assembly  customization of software  software and equipment installation and telecommunications configuration 
historically  we have funded these upfront costs through cash flows generated from operations  available cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our ability to continue to commit to new contracts will depend on  among other things  our then present liquidity levels and or our ability to borrow at commercially acceptable rates to finance the initial upfront costs 
the actual level of capital expenditures will ultimately largely depend on the extent to which we are successful in winning new contracts 
periodically  we elect to upgrade the technological capabilities of older terminals and replace terminals that have exhausted their useful lives 
servicing our installed terminal base requires that we maintain a supply of parts and accessories on hand 
we are also required  contractually in some cases  to provide spare parts over an extended period of time  principally in connection with our systems and terminal sale transactions 
to meet our contractual obligations and maintain sufficient levels of on hand inventory to service our installed base  we purchase inventory on an as needed basis 
we presently have no inventory purchase obligations  other than in the ordinary course of business 
during  we repurchased approximately million shares of our class a common stock under our previously announced repurchase program for approximately million 
at december   our available cash  short term investments and borrowing capacity totaled million including cash and cash equivalents of million and availability of million under the revolving credit facility compared to million at december  the amount of our available cash and short term investments fluctuate principally based on the timing of collections from our customers  cash expenditures associated with new and existing wagering and lottery systems contracts  borrowings or repayments under our credit facilities  the funding of joint ventures  acquisitions and changes in our working capital position 
our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility under the credit agreement will depend on the balance of loans borrowed and outstanding letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility as well as the level of certain financial ratios under the credit agreement 
the decrease in our available cash from the december  level principally reflects the net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  of million  net cash proceeds of approximately million from the sale of the racing business  million and million cash dividends from cln and rcn  respectively  plus long term borrowings of million  offset by wagering and other capital expenditures and other investing activities totaling million  acquisition related payments of million  investment in the lns joint venture of million  the repurchase of stock of million and million of payments on long term debt 
the million of net cash provided by operating activities is derived from million of net cash provided by operations and million provided by changes in working capital 
the working capital changes occurred principally from decreases in inventories  prepaid expenses  deposits and other current assets and an increase in accrued liabilities  offset by increases in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable 
capital expenditures totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
wagering system expenditures  including software expenditures  totaled million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
the wagering expenditures primarily related to the indiana lottery contract and gaming terminals related to global draw and games media 
cash flow from financing activities principally reflects the borrowings and the repayments of borrowings under the credit agreement and in connection with the issuance of the notes  as well as the repurchase of stock 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  available cash and available borrowing capacity under the credit agreement will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs  including anticipated capital expenditures  for the next twelve months  however  there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
we believe that substantially all cash held by foreign entities is available to meet liquidity needs as necessary 
our contracts are periodically renewed and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in sustaining our cash flow from operations through renewal of our existing contracts or through the addition of new contracts 
in addition  lottery customers in the united states generally require service providers to provide performance bonds in connection with each state contract 
our ability to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms is subject to prevailing market conditions  which may be impacted by economic and political events 
although we have not experienced difficulty in obtaining such bonds to date  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain performance bonds on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
if we need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness  on or before maturity  or provide letters of credit or cash in lieu of performance bonds  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain new financing or to refinance any of our indebtedness  on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
recently issued accounting guidance in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb amended the accounting standards codification asc as summarized in accounting standards update asu  software topic certain revenue arrangements that include software elements  and asu  revenue recognition topic multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
as summarized in asu  asc topic has been amended to remove from the scope of industry specific revenue accounting guidance for software and software related transactions tangible products containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the product essential functionality 
as summarized in asu  asc topic has been amended to provide updated guidance on whether multiple deliverables exist  how the deliverables in an arrangement should be separated  and the consideration allocated  to require an entity to allocate revenue in an arrangement using estimated selling prices of deliverables if a vendor does not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe or third party evidence of selling price  and to eliminate the use of the residual method and require an entity to allocate revenue using the relative selling price method 
the accounting changes summarized in asu and asu are both effective for fiscal years beginning on or after june   with early adoption permitted 
adoption may either be on a prospective basis or by retrospective application 
we adopted these amendments to the asc on january   at this time  we believe the impact of these accounting changes will be immaterial 
in june  the fasb issued amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r  which amends the consolidation guidance applicable to variable interest entities and the definition of a variable interest entity vie and requires enhanced disclosures to provide more information about an enterprise involvement in a vie 
in addition  it requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise variable interest gives it a controlling interest in a vie 
the analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of the vie as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of the vie and the obligation to absorb losses of the vie 
we adopted this statement on january  there was no financial impact of adoption of this standard 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our products and services are sold to a diverse group of customers throughout the world 
as such  we are subject to certain risks and uncertainties as a result of changes in general economic conditions  sources of supply  competition  foreign exchange rates  tax reform  litigation and regulatory developments 
see risk factors in item a of this annual report on form k for a more complete description of these risks and uncertainties 
the diversity and breadth of our products and geographic operations mitigate the risk that adverse changes from any single event would materially affect our financial position 
additionally  as a result of the diversity of our customer base  we do not consider ourselves exposed to concentration of credit risks 
these risks are further minimized by setting credit limits  ongoing monitoring of customer account balances and assessment of the customers financial strengths 
inflation has not had an abnormal or unanticipated effect on our operations 
inflationary pressures would be significant to our business if raw materials used for instant lottery ticket production or terminal manufacturing are significantly affected 
available supply from the paper and electronics industries tends to fluctuate and prices may be affected by supply 
for fiscal year  inflation was not a significant factor in our results of operations  and we were not impacted by significant pricing changes in our costs except for personnel related expenditures 
we are unable to forecast the prices or supply of substrate  component parts or other raw materials in  but we currently do not anticipate any substantial changes that will materially affect our operating results 
in certain limited cases  our lottery contracts with our customers contain provisions to adjust for inflation on an annual basis  but we cannot be assured that this adjustment would cover raw material price increases or other costs of services 
although we have long term and generally satisfactory relationships with most of our suppliers  we also believe alternative sources to meet our raw material and production needs are available 
in the normal course of business  we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates and equity market risks as we seek debt and equity capital to sustain our operations 
all of our interest rate sensitive financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading purposes 
at december   approximately of our debt was in fixed rate instruments 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates

effective october   sgi entered into a three year interest rate swap agreement the hedge with jpmorgan 
under the hedge  sgi pays interest on a million notional amount of debt at a fixed rate of and receives interest on a million notional amount of debt at the prevailing three month libor rate 
the objective of the hedge is to eliminate the variability of cash flows attributable to the libor component of interest expense paid on million of our variable rate debt 
principal amount by expected maturity average interest rate december  dollars in thousands thereafter total fmv debt at fixed interest rates weighted average interest rates debt at variable interest rates weighted average interest rates we are also exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as the financial results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated into us dollars in consolidation 
assets and liabilities outside the united states are primarily located in australia  austria  chile  germany  ireland  mexico  the netherlands  spain  sweden and the united kingdom 
our investments in foreign subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar are generally considered long term investments 
accordingly  we do not hedge these net investments 
in addition  a significant portion of the cost attributable to our foreign operations is incurred in the local currencies 
although we provide technology based products  systems and services to gaming industries worldwide  a substantial amount of our transactions and their resulting financial impact are transacted in us dollars 
the foreign currencies to which we have the most exposure are the euro and the british pound sterling  representing approximately and of our non u 
s dollar revenues in historically  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has been more significant with respect to revenues than expenses  as a significant portion of our expenses  such as paper and ink  are contracted for in us dollars 
at december   a hypothetical strengthening in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and the british pound sterling would result in a decrease in revenue and operating income of approximately million and million  respectively 
we manage our foreign currency exchange risks on a global basis by one or more of the following i securing payment from our customers in us dollars  when possible  ii entering into foreign currency exchange contracts  and iii netting asset and liability exposures denominated in similar foreign currencies to the extent possible 
we may  from time to time  enter into foreign currency exchange or other contracts to hedge the risk associated with certain firm sales commitments  anticipated revenue streams and certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
our cash and cash equivalents and investments are in high quality securities placed with a wide array of institutions with high credit ratings 
the investment policy limits our exposure to concentration of credit risks 
we believe that the impact of a increase or decrease in interest rates would not be material to our investment income and interest expense from bank loans
