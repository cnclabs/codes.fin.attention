item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
employees as of february   we had full and part time employees 
none of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement  and we have never experienced a work stoppage 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
item a 
risk factors you should carefully consider the following risks and uncertainties 
if any of the following occurs  our business  financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed 
these factors could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we have a limited operating history and have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception 
we expect to continue to incur losses in the future and may never become profitable 
we have a limited operating history 
you should consider our prospects in light of the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies 
in addition  we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur operating losses for the foreseeable future and may never become profitable 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
as we continue our research and development efforts  we will incur increasing losses 
we may continue to incur substantial operating losses even if we begin to generate revenues from our drug candidates 
we have not yet commercialized any of our drug candidates and cannot be sure that we will ever be able to do so 
even if we commercialize one or more of our drug candidates  we may not become profitable 
our ability to achieve profitability depends on a number of factors  including our ability to complete our development efforts  obtain regulatory approval for our drug candidates  successfully complete any post approval regulatory obligations and successfully commercialize our drug candidates 
risks associated with our product development efforts if we are unable to successfully complete our clinical trial programs  or if such clinical trials take longer to complete than we project  our ability to execute our current business strategy will be adversely affected 
whether or not and how quickly we complete clinical trials is dependent in part upon the rate at which we are able to engage clinical trial sites and  thereafter  the rate of enrollment of patients  and the rate we collect  clean  lock and analyze the clinical trial database 
patient enrollment is a function of many factors  including the size of the patient population  the proximity of patients to clinical sites  the eligibility criteria for the study  the existence of competitive clinical trials  and whether existing or new drugs are approved for the indication we are studying 
we are aware that other companies are currently conducting or planning clinical trials that seek to enroll patients with the same diseases that we are studying 
certain clinical trials are designed to continue until a pre determined number of events have occurred in the patients enrolled 
trials such as this are subject to delays stemming from patient withdrawal and from lower than expected event rates 
they may also incur additional costs if enrollment is increased in order to achieve the desired number of events 
if we experience delays in identifying and contracting with sites and or in patient enrollment in our clinical trial programs  we may incur additional costs and delays in our development programs  and may not be able to complete our clinical trials in a cost effective or timely manner 
in addition  conducting multi national studies adds another level of complexity and risk 
we are subject to events affecting countries outside the us negative or inconclusive results from the clinical trials we conduct or unanticipated adverse medical events could cause us to have to repeat or terminate the clinical trials 
we may also opt to change the delivery method  formulation or dosage which could affect efficacy results for the drug candidate 
for example  we have limited clinical experience with our new one gram caplet formulation for zerenex  and therefore  there is no assurance that this new formulation will be safe and efficacious when assessed in a large and or long term clinical trial setting 
we used this one gram caplet formulation in our completed phase short term study for zerenex and are currently using it in our ongoing phase long term study for zerenex 
accordingly  we may not be able to complete the clinical trials within an acceptable time frame  if at all 
in december  we initiated a phase clinical trial for krx perifosine in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma patients pursuant to a spa with the fda 
in april  we initiated a phase clinical trial for krx perifosine in patients with refractory advanced colorectal cancer also pursuant to a spa with the fda 
in may and in september  we initiated two phase clinical trials for zerenex ferric citrate as a treatment of hyperphosphatemia in patients with end stage renal disease pursuant to a spa with the fda 
many companies which have been granted spas and or the right to utilize fast track or accelerated approvals have ultimately failed to obtain final approval to market their drugs 
since we are seeking approvals under spas  based on protocol designs negotiated with the fda  we may be subject to enhanced scrutiny 
additionally  even if the primary endpoint in a phase clinical trial is achieved  a spa does not guarantee approval 
the fda may raise issues of safety  study conduct  bias  deviation from the protocol  statistical power  patient completion rates  changes in scientific or medical parameters or internal inconsistencies in the data prior to making its final decision 
the fda may also seek the guidance of an outside advisory committee prior to making its final decision 
additionally  we have never filed a nda  or similar application for approval in the us  or in any country  which may result in a delay in  or the rejection of  our filing of an nda or similar application 
during the drug development process  regulatory agencies will typically ask questions of drug sponsors 
while we endeavor to answer all such questions in a timely fashion  or in the nda filing  some questions may remain unanswered by the time we file our nda 
unless the fda opts not to pursue these questions  submission of a nda may be delayed or rejected 
pre clinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
if our drug candidates do not receive the necessary regulatory approvals  we will be unable to commercialize our drug candidates 
we have not received  and may never receive  regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our drug candidates 
we will need to conduct significant additional research and human testing before we can apply for product approval with the fda or with regulatory authorities of other countries 
pre clinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
satisfaction of regulatory requirements typically depends on the nature  complexity and novelty of the product 
it requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
data obtained from pre clinical and clinical tests can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the fda may pose additional questions or request further clinical substantiation 
it may take us many years to complete the testing of our drug candidates and failure can occur at any stage of this process 
negative or inconclusive results or medical events during a pre clinical or clinical trial could cause us to delay or terminate our development efforts 
furthermore  interim results of preclinical or clinical studies do not necessarily predict their final results  and acceptable results in early studies might not be obtained in later studies 
safety signals detected during clinical studies and pre clinical animal studies  such as the gastrointestinal bleeding and liver toxicities that have been seen in some high dose  ferric citrate canine studies  may require us to perform additional safety studies or analyses  which could delay the development of the drug or lead to a decision to discontinue development of the drug 
we have submitted to the fda data from our short term and long term rat and canine pre clinical studies for zerenex 
while the fda has reviewed the data from these studies and has permitted us to continue with our phase clinical program  we can provide no assurance that the fda will not raise any safety concerns in the future from these studies 
drug candidates in the later stages of clinical development may fail to show the desired traits of safety and efficacy despite positive results in initial clinical testing 
the risk remains that a pivotal program may generate efficacy data that will be insufficiently persuasive for the approval of the drug  or may raise safety concerns that may prevent approval of the drug 
the risk also remains that a clinical program conducted by one of our partners may raise efficacy or safety concerns that may prevent approval of the drug 
interpretation of the prior pre clinical and clinical safety and efficacy data of our drug candidates may be flawed 
there can be no assurance that safety and or efficacy concerns from the prior data were not overlooked or misinterpreted  which in subsequent  larger studies might appear and prevent approval of such drug candidates 
top line results are based on a preliminary analysis of then available data both safety and efficacy and there is the risk that that such findings and conclusions could change following a more comprehensive review of the data 
we may not be able to replicate in our phase clinical program for zerenex  the efficacy and safety results for zerenex observed in the previous phase and phase clinical trials and the ole clinical trial 
the positive effects of zerenex on iv iron and esa use observed in the ole clinical trial may not be reproducible 
further  any negative effects of the potential absorption and or accumulation of ferric iron or citrate would significantly limit the likelihood of obtaining regulatory approval for zerenex 
in addition  we may not be able to replicate in the phase trials for krx  the efficacy and safety results for krx observed in previous clinical trials 
in addition  we will need to re input our safety information on krx into a database compliant with good clinical practice 
we can provide no assurance that safety concerns will not subsequently arise 
independent data safety monitoring committees  or dsmcs  are monitoring the safety of our phase clinical trials for krx perifosine and zerenex ferric citrate and  in accordance with the protocols for the clinical trials  will periodically assess whether the phase trials should continue as planned 
the dsmcs have the authority to recommend placing a trial on clinical hold  temporarily or permanently  or recommend termination of the clinical trial  based on an evaluation of safety and efficacy 
the dsmcs are independent from us and we have no control or influence on their decisions 
clinical trials have a high risk of failure 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical industry  including biotechnology companies  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after achieving what appeared to be promising results in earlier trials 
if we experience delays in the testing or approval process or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than originally planned  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our drug candidates may be materially impaired 
in addition  we have limited experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval in the us and abroad 
accordingly  we may encounter unforeseen problems and delays in the approval process 
although we may engage a clinical research organization with experience in conducting regulatory trials  errors in the conduct  monitoring and or auditing could potentially invalidate the results 
because all of our proprietary technologies are licensed to us by third parties  termination of these license agreements would prevent us from developing our drug candidates 
we do not own any of our drug candidates 
we have licensed the rights  patent or otherwise  to our drugs candidates from third parties 
these license agreements require us to meet development milestones and impose development and commercialization due diligence requirements on us 
in addition  under these agreements  we must pay royalties on sales of products resulting from licensed technologies and pay the patent filing  prosecution and maintenance costs related to the licenses 
if we do not meet our obligations in a timely manner or if we otherwise breach the terms of our license agreements  our licensors could terminate the agreements  and we would lose the rights to our drug candidates 
from time to time  in the ordinary course of business  we may have disagreements with our licensors or collaborators regarding the terms of our agreements or ownership of proprietary rights  which could lead to delays in the research  development and commercialization of our drug candidates or could require or result in litigation or arbitration  which would be time consuming and expensive 
we rely on third parties to manufacture and analytically test our products 
if these third parties do not successfully manufacture and test our products  our business will be harmed 
we have limited experience in manufacturing products for clinical or commercial purposes 
we intend to continue  in whole or in part  to use third parties to manufacture and analytically test our products for use in clinical trials and for future sales 
we may not be able to enter into future contract agreements with these third parties on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
our ability to conduct clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates will depend on the ability of such third parties to manufacture our products on a large scale at a competitive cost and in accordance with cgmp and other regulatory requirements  including requirements from federal and state environmental and safety eg epa  osha regulatory agencies 
prior to approval  we will need to conduct validation studies that the fda must review and approve 
significant scale up of manufacturing may result in unanticipated technical challenges and may require additional validation studies that the fda must review and approve 
contract manufacturers often encounter difficulties in scaling up production  including problems involving raw material supplies  production yields  scaled up product characteristics  quality control and assurance  shortage of qualified personnel  compliance with fda and foreign regulations  production costs and development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls 
these risks become more acute as we scale up for commercial quantities  where a reliable source of raw material supplies becomes critical to commercial success 
for example  given the large quantity of materials required for ferric citrate production  as we approach commercialization for zerenex we will need to ensure an adequate supply of starting materials that meet quality  quantity and cost standards 
failure to achieve this level of supply can jeopardize the successful commercialization of the product 
moreover  issues that may arise in our current transition to a commercial batch manufacturer for zerenex can lead to delays in our planned clinical trials and development timelines  and could affect our ability to complete our clinical trials on a cost effective or timely basis  if at all 
our third party manufacturers may not perform as agreed or may not remain in the contract manufacturing business for the time required by us to successfully produce and market our drug candidates 
in addition  our contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic and unannounced inspections by the fda and corresponding foreign governmental agencies to ensure strict compliance with cgmp  as well as other governmental regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
while we periodically audit our contractors for adherence to regulatory requirements  we cannot assure you that unforeseen changes at these contractors may occur that change their regulatory standing 
the same issues apply to contract analytical services which we use for testing of our products 
we will not have control over  other than by contract and periodic oversight  third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
we are currently developing analytical tools for ferric citrate active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product testing 
failure to develop effective analytical tools could result in regulatory or technical delay or could jeopardize our ability to complete phase clinical trials and or obtain fda approval 
switching or engaging multiple third party contractors to produce our products may be difficult because the number of potential manufacturers may be limited and the process by which multiple manufacturers make the drug substance must be identical at each manufacturing facility 
it may be difficult for us to find and engage replacement or multiple manufacturers quickly and on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
for zerenex  we currently rely on one supplier to source the ferric citrate active pharmaceutical ingredient 
the loss of this source of supply would result in significant additional costs and delays in our development program 
moreover  if we need to change manufacturers after commercialization  the fda and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies must approve these manufacturers in advance  which will involve testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with fda and foreign regulations and standards 
if we do not establish or maintain manufacturing  drug development and marketing arrangements with third parties  we may be unable to commercialize our products 
we do not possess all of the capabilities to fully commercialize our products on our own 
from time to time  we may need to contract with third parties to manufacture our product candidates  assist us in developing  testing and obtaining regulatory approval for and commercializing some of our compounds and technologies  and market and distribute our drug products 
we can provide no assurance that we will be able to successfully enter into agreements with such third parties on terms that are acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to successfully contract with third parties for these services when needed  or if existing arrangements for these services are terminated  whether or not through our actions  or if such third parties do not fully perform under these arrangements  we may have to delay  scale back or end one or more of our drug development programs or seek to develop or commercialize our products independently  which could result in delays 
furthermore  such failure could result in the termination of license rights to one or more of our products 
if these manufacturing  development or marketing agreements take the form of a partnership or strategic alliance  such arrangements may provide our collaborators with significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to the development and commercialization of our products 
accordingly  to the extent that we rely on third parties to research  develop or commercialize our products  we are unable to control whether such products will be scientifically or commercially successful 
additionally  if these third parties fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or fail to perform their work in a satisfactory manner  in spite of our efforts to monitor and ensure the quality of such work  we may face delays in achieving the regulatory milestones required for commercialization of one or more drug candidates 
if  in the future  the market conditions for raising capital deteriorate  we may be forced to rely predominantly or entirely on our ability to contract with third parties for our manufacturing  drug development and marketing 
if we are unable to contract with such third parties  we may be forced to limit or suspend or terminate the development of some or all of our product candidates 
our reliance on third parties  such as clinical research organizations  or cros  may result in delays in completing  or a failure to complete  clinical trials if such cros fail to perform under our agreements with them 
in the course of product development  we engage cros to conduct and manage clinical studies and to assist us in guiding our products through the fda review and approval process 
if the cros fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them or fail to perform clinical trials in a satisfactory manner  we may face delays in completing our clinical trials  as well as commercialization of one or more drug candidates 
furthermore  any loss or delay in obtaining contracts with such entities may also delay the completion of our clinical trials and the market approval of drug candidates 
other risks related to our business if we are unable to develop adequate sales  marketing or distribution capabilities or enter into agreements with third parties to perform some of these functions  we will not be able to commercialize our products effectively 
in the event that one or more of our drug candidates are approved by the fda  we currently plan to conduct our own sales and marketing effort to support the drugs 
we currently have limited experience in sales  marketing or distribution 
to directly market and distribute any products  we must build a sales and marketing organization with appropriate technical expertise and distribution capabilities 
we may attempt to build such a sales and marketing organization on our own or with the assistance of a contract sales organization 
for some market opportunities  we may want or need to enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements with larger pharmaceutical or biotechnology firms in order to increase the commercial success of our products 
we may not be able to establish sales  marketing and distribution capabilities of our own or enter into such arrangements with third parties in a timely manner or on acceptable terms 
to the extent that we enter into co promotion or other licensing arrangements  our product revenues are likely to be lower than if we directly marketed and sold our products  and some or all of the revenues we receive will depend upon the efforts of third parties  and these efforts may not be successful 
additionally  building marketing and distribution capabilities may be more expensive than we anticipate  requiring us to divert capital from other intended purposes or preventing us from building our marketing and distribution capabilities to the desired levels 
notwithstanding our current plans to commercialize our drug candidates  from time to time we may consider offers or hold discussions with companies for partnerships or the acquisition of our company or any of our products 
any accepted offer may preclude us from commercializing our products effectively 
even if we obtain fda approval to market our drug products  if they fail to achieve market acceptance  we may never record meaningful revenues 
even if our products are approved for sale  they may not be commercially successful in the marketplace 
market acceptance of our drug products will depend on a number of factors  including perceptions by members of the health care community  including physicians  of the safety and efficacy of our product candidates  including  but not limited to  the perception of the long term effects of the potential absorption and or accumulation of ferric iron or citrate resulting from the use of zerenex  the rates of adoption of our products by medical practitioners and the target populations for our products  the potential advantages that our products offer over existing treatment methods  the cost effectiveness of our products relative to competing products  the availability of government or third party payor reimbursement for our products  the side effects or unfavorable publicity concerning our products or similar products  and the effectiveness of our sales  marketing and distribution efforts 
because we expect sales of our products  if approved  to generate substantially all of our revenues in the long term  the failure of our drugs to find market acceptance would harm our business and could require us to seek additional financing or other sources of revenue 
if our competitors develop and market products that are less expensive  more effective or safer than our drug products  our commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated 
the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive 
our competitors include pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies  as well as universities and public and private research institutions 
in addition  companies that are active in different but related fields represent substantial competition for us 
many of our competitors have significantly greater capital resources  larger research and development staffs and facilities and greater experience in drug development  regulation  manufacturing and marketing than we do 
these organizations also compete with us to recruit qualified personnel  attract partners for joint ventures or other collaborations  and license technologies that are competitive with ours 
as a result  our competitors may be able to more easily develop technologies and products that could render our drug products obsolete or noncompetitive 
to compete successfully in this industry we must identify novel and unique drugs or methods of treatment and then complete the development of those drugs as treatments in advance of our competitors 
the drugs that we are attempting to develop will have to compete with existing therapies 
for example  krx perifosine  if approved in the us would compete with other anti cancer agents  such as mtor inhibitors 
pfizer inc  novartis ag and ariad pharmaceuticals are developing mtor inhibitors for use in cancer and pfizer s mtor inhibitor  temsirolimus  and novartis mtor inhibitor  everolimus  have been approved to treat patients with advanced kidney disease 
biotechnology companies such as amgen inc  biogen idec  inc  imclone systems  inc a wholly owned subsidiary of eli lilly and company  merck co  inc  millennium pharmaceuticals  inc 
a wholly owned subsidiary of takeda pharmaceutical company  novartis ag  onyx pharmaceuticals  inc and osi pharmaceuticals  inc 
are developing and  in some cases  marketing drugs to treat various diseases  including cancer  by inhibiting cell signaling pathways 
in addition  we are aware of a number of small and large companies developing competitive products that target akt and the pik pathway 
zerenex  if approved in the us  would compete with other fda approved phosphate binders such as renagel sevelamer hydrochloride and renvela sevelamer carbonate  both marketed by genzyme corporation  phoslo calcium acetate  marketed by fresenius medical care  and fosrenol lanthanum carbonate  marketed by shire pharmaceuticals group plc  as well as over the counter calcium carbonate products such as tums and metal based options such as aluminum and magnesium 
a generic formulation of phoslo manufactured by roxane laboratories  inc was launched in the us in october in addition  upon the expiration of their core patents expected in  generic formulations of renagel and renvela may be launched  which could have a material effect on the pricing of phosphate binders 
our commercial opportunities may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are less expensive  more effective or safer than our drug products 
other companies have drug candidates in various stages of pre clinical or clinical development to treat diseases for which we are also seeking to discover and develop drug products 
some of these potential competing drugs are further advanced in development than our drug candidates and may be commercialized earlier 
even if we are successful in developing effective drugs  our products may not compete successfully with products produced by our competitors 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  our operations could be disrupted and our business could be harmed 
as of february   we had full and part time employees 
to successfully develop our drug candidates  we must be able to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
our limited resources may hinder our efforts to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
in addition  if we lose the services of our current personnel  in particular  ron bentsur  our chief executive officer  our ability to continue to execute on our business plan could be materially impaired 
although we have an employment agreement with mr 
bentsur  such agreement does not prevent him from terminating his employment with us 
any acquisitions we make may require a significant amount of our available cash and may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
as part of our business strategy  we may effect acquisitions to obtain additional businesses  products  technologies  capabilities and personnel 
if we make one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes cash  we may be required to use a substantial portion of our available cash 
acquisitions involve a number of operational risks  including difficulty and expense of assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the acquired business  our inability to retain the management  key personnel and other employees of the acquired business  our inability to maintain the acquired company relationship with key third parties  such as alliance partners  exposure to legal claims for activities of the acquired business prior to the acquisition  the diversion of our management attention from our core business  and the potential impairment of goodwill and write off of in process research and development costs  adversely affecting our reported results of operations 
the status of reimbursement from third party payors for newly approved health care drugs is uncertain and failure to obtain adequate reimbursement could limit our ability to generate revenue 
our ability to commercialize pharmaceutical products may depend  in part  on the extent to which reimbursement for the products will be available from government and health administration authorities  private health insurers  managed care programs  and other third party payors 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products 
third party payors  including medicare  are challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
government and other third party payors increasingly are attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new drugs and by refusing  in some cases  to provide coverage for uses of approved products for disease indications for which the fda has not granted labeling approval 
third party insurance coverage may not be available to patients for our products 
if government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for our products  their market acceptance may be reduced 
health care reform measures could adversely affect our business 
the business prospects and financial condition of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are affected by the efforts of governmental and third party payors to contain or reduce the costs of health care 
in the us and in foreign jurisdictions there have been  and we expect that there will continue to be  a number of legislative and regulatory proposals aimed at changing the health care system  such as proposals relating to the pricing of healthcare products and services in the us or internationally  the reimportation of drugs into the us from other countries where they are then sold at a lower price  and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third party payors 
in the us  health care reform legislation titled the patient protection and affordable care act and the reconciliation act was signed into law on march  this comprehensive legislation will affect the terms of public and private health insurance and have a substantial impact on the pharmaceutical industry 
for example  the new law will impose an annual fee on manufacturers of branded prescription pharmaceuticals that will impact our products 
regulations to implement this and other provisions related to the research  marketing and sale of prescription pharmaceutical products could result in a decrease in our stock price or limit our ability to raise capital or to obtain strategic partnerships or licenses 
government financed comparative efficacy research could also result in new practice guidelines  labeling or reimbursement policies that discourages use of our products 
for example  in july  the centers for medicare medicaid services  or cms  released its final rule to implement a bundled prospective payment system for end stage renal disease facilities as required by the medicare improvements for patients and providers act  or mippa 
the final rule did not include oral medications without iv equivalents  such as phosphate binders  in the bundle until january  if phosphate binders are bundled into the composite rate beginning in  separate medicare reimbursement will no longer be available for phosphate binders 
while it is too early to project the impact bundling may have on the phosphate binder industry  the impact could potentially cause dramatic price reductions for phosphate binders 
on september   the food and drug administration amendments act of was enacted  giving the fda enhanced post market authority  including the authority to require post marketing studies and clinical trials  labeling changes based on new safety information  and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies approved by the fda 
the fda exercise of this authority may result in delays or increased costs during the period of product development  clinical trials and regulatory review and approval  which may also increase costs related to complying with new post approval regulatory requirements  and increase potential fda restrictions on the sale or distribution of approved products 
we face product liability risks and may not be able to obtain adequate insurance 
the use of our drug candidates in clinical trials  the future sale of any approved drug candidates and new technologies  and our sale of accumin prior to its discontinuation  exposes us to liability claims 
although we are not aware of any historical or anticipated product liability claims against us  if we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims  we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to cease clinical trials of our drug candidates or limit commercialization of any approved products 
we believe that we have obtained sufficient product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials and the sale of accumin prior to its discontinuation 
we intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the commercial sale of any approved products if marketing approval is obtained  however  insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive 
we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost 
we also may not be able to obtain additional insurance coverage that will be adequate to cover product liability risks that may arise 
regardless of merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for a product  injury to our reputation  our inability to continue to develop a drug candidate  withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers  and loss of revenues 
consequently  a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material 
in connection with providing our clinical trial management and site recruitment services  we may be exposed to liability that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the online collaborative oncology group  inc  or ocog  a subsidiary we acquired through our acquisition of access oncology  inc in  provides clinical trial management and site recruitment services to us as well as other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies 
ocog has not entered into a new third party service contracts since and does not plan to enter into any further service contracts 
in conducting the activities of ocog  any failure on our part to comply with applicable governmental regulations or contractual obligations could expose us to liability to our clients and could have a material adverse effect on us 
we also could be held liable for errors or omissions in connection with the services we perform 
in addition  the wrongful or erroneous delivery of health care information or services may expose us to liability 
if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any such claims  the losses could be material 
our corporate compliance efforts cannot guarantee that we are in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations 
the development  manufacturing  pricing  sales  and reimbursement of our products  together with our general operations  are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and other authorities within the us and numerous entities outside of the us we are a relatively small company with full and part time employees as of february  we also have significantly fewer employees than many other companies that have a product candidate in clinical development  and we rely heavily on third parties to conduct many important functions 
while we believe that our corporate compliance program is sufficient to ensure compliance with applicable regulations  we cannot assure you that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable regulations 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions  including suspension or termination of clinical trials  the failure to approve a product candidate  restrictions on our products or manufacturing processes  withdrawal of products from the market  significant fines  or other sanctions or litigation 
risks related to our financial condition our current cash  cash equivalents and investment securities may not be adequate to finance our operating cash requirements for the length of time that we have estimated 
we currently anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities as of december   exclusive of our anticipated milestone payments to be received and expected exercises of expiring options  are sufficient to fund our anticipated operating cash requirements for approximately months from december  including anticipated milestone payments to be received and the estimated proceeds from the exercise of expiring options  we currently anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities as of december  are sufficient to fund our anticipated operating cash requirements for approximately to months from december  our forecast of the period of time through which our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities will be adequate to support our current operations is a forward looking statement that involves risks and uncertainties 
the actual amount of funds we will need to operate is subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
these factors include  but are not limited to  the following the timing  design and conduct of  and results from  clinical trials for our drug candidates  the timing of expenses associated with manufacturing and product development of the proprietary drug candidates within our portfolio and those that may be in licensed  partnered or acquired  the timing of the in licensing  partnering and acquisition of new product opportunities  the progress of the development efforts of parties with whom we have entered  or may enter  into research and development agreements  our ability to achieve our milestones under our licensing arrangements  and the costs involved in prosecuting and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
if our cash is insufficient to meet future operating requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
if we are unable to obtain additional funds on terms favorable to us or at all  we may be required to cease or reduce our operating activities or sell or license to third parties some or all of our intellectual property 
if we raise additional funds by selling additional shares of our capital stock  the ownership interests of our stockholders will be diluted 
if we need to raise additional funds through the sale or license of our intellectual property  we may be unable to do so on terms favorable to us  if at all 
risks related to our intellectual property and third party contracts if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  third parties may be able to use our intellectual property  which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market 
our commercial success will depend in part on our ability and the ability of our licensors to obtain and maintain patent protection on our drug products and technologies and successfully defend these patents against third party challenges 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents has emerged to date 
accordingly  the patents we use may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar or alternative drug products or technologies or design around our patented drug products and technologies 
the patents we use may be challenged or invalidated or may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage 
we rely on trade secrets to protect our intellectual property where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable 
trade secrets are difficult to protect 
while we require our employees  collaborators and consultants to enter into confidentiality agreements  this may not be sufficient to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
in addition  we share ownership and publication rights to data relating to some of our drug products and technologies with our research collaborators and scientific advisors 
if we cannot maintain the confidentiality of this information  our ability to receive patent protection or protect our trade secrets or other proprietary information will be at risk 
the intellectual property that we own or have licensed relating to our product candidates is limited  which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect the value of our product candidates 
the patent rights that we own or have licensed relating to our product candidates are limited in ways that may affect our ability to exclude third parties from competing against us if we obtain regulatory approval to market these product candidates 
in particular our composition of matter patent covering krx perifosine expires in the second half of and we cannot assure you that we can obtain an extension to the second half of the maximum term of extension under the patent term restoration program 
our composition of matter patent covering zerenex expires in the second half of and we cannot assure you that we can obtain an extension to the maximum term of extension under the patent term restoration program 
composition of matter patents can provide protection for pharmaceutical products to the extent that the specifically covered compositions are important 
upon expiration of our composition of matter patents for krx and zerenex  competitors who obtain the requisite regulatory approval can offer products with the same composition as our products so long as the competitors do not infringe any other patents that we may hold  such as method of use patents 
our method of use patents only protect the products when used or sold for the specified method 
however  this type of patent does not limit a competitor from making and marketing a product that is identical to our product that is labeled for an indication that is outside of our patented method  or for which there is a substantial use in commerce outside our patented method 
our pending patent applications may not issue as patents and may not issue in all countries in which we develop  manufacture or potentially sell our products or in countries where others develop  manufacture and potentially sell products using our technologies 
moreover  our pending patent applications  if issued as patents  may not provide additional protection for our products 
proof of direct infringement by a competitor for method of use patents can prove difficult because the competitors making and marketing a product typically do not engage in the patented use 
additionally  proof that a competitor contributes to or induces infringement of a patented method of use by another can also prove difficult because an off label use of a product could prohibit a finding of contributory infringement and inducement of infringement requires proof of intent by the competitor 
moreover  physicians may prescribe such a competitive identical product for indications other than the one for which the product has been approved  or off label indications  that are covered by the applicable patents 
although such off label prescriptions may directly infringe or contribute to or induce infringement of method of use patents  such infringement is difficult to prevent or prosecute 
in addition  the limited patent protection described above may adversely affect the value of our product candidates and may inhibit our ability to obtain a corporate partner at terms acceptable to us  if at all 
in addition to patent protection  we may utilize orphan drug regulations or other provisions of the fdca to provide market exclusivity for certain of our drug candidates 
orphan drug regulations provide incentives to pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to develop and manufacture drugs for the treatment of rare diseases  currently defined as diseases that exist in fewer than  individuals in the us  or  diseases that affect more than  individuals in the us but that the sponsor does not realistically anticipate will generate a net profit 
under these provisions  a manufacturer of a designated orphan drug can seek tax benefits  and the holder of the first fda approval of a designated orphan product will be granted a seven year period of marketing exclusivity for such fda approved orphan product 
in september  we announced that krx perifosine has received orphan drug designation from the fda for the treatment of multiple myeloma  and in july  we announced that krx has received orphan drug designation from the fda for the treatment of neuroblastoma 
we believe that krx may be eligible for additional orphan drug designations  however  we cannot assure that krx  or any other drug candidates we may acquire or in license  will obtain such orphan drug designations 
additionally  upon fda approval  we believe that perifosine would qualify as a new chemical entity  which provides for five years of exclusivity following approval 
litigation or third party claims could require us to spend substantial time and money defending such claims and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our products 
we may be forced to initiate litigation to enforce our contractual and intellectual property rights  or we may be sued by third parties asserting claims based on contract  tort or intellectual property infringement 
in addition  third parties may have or may obtain patents in the future and claim that our drug products or technologies infringe their patents 
if we are required to defend against suits brought by third parties  or if we sue third parties to protect our rights  we may be required to pay substantial litigation costs  and our management attention may be diverted from operating our business 
in addition  any legal action against our licensors or us that seeks damages or an injunction of our commercial activities relating to our drug products or technologies could subject us to monetary liability and require our licensors or us to obtain a license to continue to use our drug products or technologies 
we cannot predict whether our licensors or we would prevail in any of these types of actions or that any required license would be made available on commercially acceptable terms  if at all 
risks related to our common stock future sales or other issuances of our common stock could depress the market for our common stock 
sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock  or the perception by the market that those sales could occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline or could make it more difficult for us to raise funds through the sale of equity in the future 
on august   we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s file no 
 that was declared effective by the sec on september   providing for the offering of up to million of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock 
subsequent to the registered direct offering that was completed on september   there remains approximately million of our common stock and warrants available for sale on this shelf registration statement 
on january   we filed with the sec a shelf registration statement on form s file no 
 that was declared effective by the sec on january   providing for the offering of up to million of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock 
future sales pursuant to these registration statements could depress the market for our common stock 
if we make one or more significant acquisitions in which the consideration includes stock or other securities  our stockholders holdings may be significantly diluted 
in addition  stockholders holdings may also be diluted if we enter into arrangements with third parties permitting us to issue shares of common stock in lieu of certain cash payments upon the achievement of milestones 
in addition  we may be required to issue up to  shares of our common stock to former stockholders of access oncology  inc upon the achievement of certain development and sales milestones 
our stock price can be volatile  which increases the risk of litigation  and may result in a significant decline in the value of your investment 
the trading price of our common stock is likely to be highly volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include developments concerning our drug candidates  announcements of technological innovations by us or our competitors  introductions or announcements of new products by us or our competitors  announcements by us of significant acquisitions  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  actual or anticipated variations in quarterly operating results and liquidity  expiration or termination of licenses  research contracts or other collaboration agreements  conditions or trends in the regulatory climate and the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries  changes in the market valuations of similar companies  and additions or departures of key personnel 
in addition  equity markets in general  and the market for biotechnology and life sciences companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies traded in those markets 
these broad market and industry factors may materially affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our development and operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could cause us to incur substantial costs to defend such claims and divert management attention and resources  which could seriously harm our business 
certain anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could make a third party acquisition of us difficult 
this could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  or control us 
these factors could limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation allows us to issue preferred stock with the approval of our stockholders 
the issuance of preferred stock could decrease the amount of earnings and assets available for distribution to the holders of our common stock or could adversely affect the rights and powers  including voting rights  of such holders 
in certain circumstances  such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of our common stock 
our amended and restated bylaws eliminate the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders  which could make it more difficult for stockholders to effect certain corporate actions 
any of these provisions could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control
