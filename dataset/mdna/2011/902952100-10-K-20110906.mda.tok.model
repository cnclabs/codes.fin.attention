item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion reviews and analyzes the consolidated results of operations for the past three fiscal years and other factors that may affect future financial performance 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  notes to the consolidated financial statements and selected financial data 
recent trends in financial markets during the fiscal year ended june   the performance of the securities markets generally improved as the global economy emerged from the severe downturn in the global financial markets and moved toward recovery 
although the global financial markets demonstrated indications of stabilization  volatility remained throughout the year  as was evidenced by the sovereign debt crisis in europe 
general macro economic concerns  such as the possibility of deflation  double dip recession  the european debt situation and the recent us debt ceiling debate have caused investors to remain risk averse 
as a consequence of these events  mutual funds  in general  have seen asset flows directed towards investments such as fixed income and cash 
the volatility in the company revenue is correlated to the price swings in natural resources and emerging markets  which represent roughly percent of assets under management 
for the past years  the one year normal volatility of one standard deviation has been percent for the s p  approximately percent for the msci emerging markets and nearly percent for gold equities 
to manage expenses  the company maintains a flexible structure for one of its largest costs  compensation expense  by setting relatively lower base salaries with bonuses that are related to average assets under management and fund performance 
thus  our expense model expands and contracts with asset swings and performance 
business segments the company  with principal operations located in san antonio  texas  manages two business segments the company offers a broad range of investment management products and services to meet the needs of individual and institutional investors  and the company invests for its own account in an effort to add growth and value to its cash position 
although the company generates the majority of its revenues from its investment advisory segment  the company holds a significant amount of its total assets in investments 
the following is a brief discussion of the company s two business segments 
investment management products and services the company generates substantially all of its operating revenues from managing and servicing usgif and other advisory clients 
these revenues are largely dependent on the total value and composition of assets under its management 
fluctuations in the markets and investor sentiment directly impact the funds asset levels  thereby affecting income and results of operations

at june   total assets under management as of period end  including both sec registered funds and offshore clients  were billion versus billion at june   an increase of percent

table of contents as shown above  both average and period end assets under management increased in total in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in assets under management in fiscal and fiscal was driven by market appreciation in the equity funds  primarily in the natural resources category 
money market and fixed income funds experienced a net decrease in both comparative periods as shareholders sought alternatives to low yields 
stock market performance was marked by wide swings in and into after the financial markets somewhat rebounded in from the global financial crisis 
equities linked to gold and broader natural resources  where most of the assets managed by the company are invested  were also volatile 
the global financial crisis and subsequent volatility in markets  combined with fund performance  were significant factors in the shareholder activity shown in all periods 
the average annualized investment management fee rate total mutual fund advisory fees  excluding performance fees  as a percentage of average assets under management was basis points in fiscal  compared to basis points in fiscal the average investment management fee for equity funds has remained relatively stable for fiscal and at and basis points  respectively 
the increase in the average equity management fee rate from basis points in fiscal to basis points in fiscal was due to a modification of the agreement to waive fees and or reduce expenses of the funds 
the agreement changed from a contractual to a voluntary agreement effective october   and expense caps on the equity funds were increased 
the average investment management fee for the fixed income funds was nil or close to nil for fiscal and and basis points in fiscal this is due to voluntary fee waivers on these funds as discussed in note to the financial statements  including a voluntary agreement to support the yields for the money market funds 
investment activities management believes it can more effectively manage the company s cash position by maintaining certain types of investments utilized in cash management and continues to believe that such activities are in the best interest of the company

critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
management reviews these estimates on an ongoing basis 
estimates are based on experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while recent accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated 
table of contents financial statements  the company believes the accounting policies that require management to make assumptions and estimates involving significant judgment are those relating to valuation of investments  income taxes and valuation of stock based compensation 
investments 
the company accounts for its investments in securities in accordance with asc investments debt and equity securities formerly sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the company classifies its investments in equity and debt securities based on intent 
management determines the appropriate classification of securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each reporting period date 
securities that are purchased and held principally for the purpose of selling in the near term are classified as trading securities and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these securities are included in earnings 
investments in debt securities or mortgage backed securities that are purchased with the intent and ability to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity and measured at amortized cost 
the company currently has no investments in debt securities or mortgage backed securities 
investments classified as neither trading securities nor held to maturity securities are classified as available for sale securities and reported at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on these available for sale securities are excluded from earnings  reported net of tax as a separate component of shareholders equity and recorded in earnings when realized 
the company evaluates its investments for other than temporary declines in value on a periodic basis 
this may exist when the fair value of an investment security has been below the current value for an extended period of time 
when a security in the company s investment portfolio has an unrealized loss in fair value that is deemed to be other than temporary  the company reduces the book value of such security to its current fair value  recognizing the credit related decline as a realized loss in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income and a revised gaap cost basis for the security is established 
for available for sale securities with declines in value deemed other than temporary  the unrealized loss recorded net of tax in accumulated other comprehensive income is realized as a charge to net income 
the company records security transactions on trade date 
realized gains or losses from security transactions are calculated on the first in first out cost basis  unless otherwise identifiable  and are recorded in earnings on the date of sale 
securities traded on a securities exchange are valued at the last sale price 
securities for which over the counter market quotations are available  but for which there was no trade on or near the balance sheet date  are valued at the mean price between the last price bid and last price asked 
securities for which quotations are not readily available are valued at management s estimate of fair value 
income taxes 
the company s annual effective income tax rate is based on the mix of income and losses in its us and us entities which are part of the company s consolidated financial statements  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to the company in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax positions 
tax law requires certain items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the company s consolidated income statement 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on the company s consolidated tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in the tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the 
table of contents years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment dates 
in addition  excess tax benefits associated with stock option exercises also create a difference between the tax rate used in the consolidated tax return and the effective tax rate in the company s consolidated income statement 
the company assesses uncertain tax positions in accordance with asc income taxes formerly fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
judgment is used to identify  recognize and measure the amounts to be recorded in the financial statements related to tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
a liability is recognized to represent the potential future obligation to the taxing authority for the benefit taken in the tax return 
these liabilities are adjusted  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
judgment is used in classifying unrecognized tax benefits as either current or noncurrent liabilities in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
a liability associated with unrecognized tax benefits will generally be classified as a noncurrent liability because there will usually be a period of several years between the filing of the tax return and the final resolution of an uncertain tax position with the taxing authority 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which reserves have been established are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award  and the cost is recognized as expense ratably over the award s vesting period 
the company measured the fair value of stock options granted in fiscal on the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
no options were granted in fiscal or fiscal the company believes that the estimates related to stock based compensation expense are critical accounting estimates because the assumptions used could significantly impact the timing and amount of stock based compensation expense recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the company s balance sheet includes assets whose fair value is subject to market risks 
due to the company s investments in equity securities  equity price fluctuations represent a market risk factor affecting the company s consolidated financial position 
the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or  if not actively traded  management s estimate of fair value as of the balance sheet date 
market prices fluctuate  and the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may differ significantly from the reported market value 
the company s investment activities are reviewed and monitored by company compliance personnel  and various reports are provided to certain investment advisory clients 
written procedures are in place to manage compliance with the code of ethics and other policies affecting the company s investment practices 
the table below summarizes the company s equity price risks as of june   and shows the effects of a hypothetical increase and a decrease in market prices 
estimated fair value after increase decrease in fair value at hypothetical hypothetical price shareholders equity  june  percentage change change net of tax trading securities  increase   decrease   available for sale  increase   decrease   unrealized and realized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings in the statement of operations 
unrealized and realized gains and losses on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and recorded in other comprehensive income as a component of shareholders equity until realized 
the selected hypothetical changes do not reflect what could be considered best or worst case scenarios 
results could be significantly different due to both the nature of equity markets and the concentration of the company s investment portfolio
