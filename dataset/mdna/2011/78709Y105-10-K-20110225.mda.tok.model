the company has announced its intention to reinstate one half of its k match effective april  if the company builds market share  there are numerous operating leverage cost benefits 
conversely  should the economy soften from present levels  the company plans to attempt to match resources and capacity to shifting volume levels to lessen unfavorable operating leverage 
the success of cost improvement initiatives is also impacted by the cost and availability of drivers and purchased transportation  fuel  insurance claims  regulatory changes  successful implementation of profit improvement initiatives and other factors discussed under risk factors and forward looking statements
