item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
note in prior years  we recognized two business segments packaging film and color printing and four product lines bopp tobacco film  coated film  anti counterfeit film and color printing for reporting and disclosure purposes management has determined that this no longer accurately reflects our business and our future growth and  as a result  we have reclassified our business segments and product line discussion to more closely align our financial reporting with our business structure 
as a result of this reclassification  we now recognize two business segments and product line classifications in both instances these are flexible packaging material and advanced film 
the reclassification reflects primarily revenue and expenses among business segments 
none of the changes impacts our previously reported consolidated net revenue  earnings from operations  net earnings or net earnings per share 
our flexible packaging material segment includes the following product categories bopp tobacco films  coated films and color printing products  while our advanced film segment currently includes out high tech anti counterfeiting film

 which was issued in january item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  however  we believe those risks to be not material in relation to our operations 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
interest rate risk as of december   we held no money market securities or short term available for sale marketable securities 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
therefore  we would not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on our securities portfolio 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our revenues are denominated in rmb and  as a result  we have certain exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to current revenues 
a majority of our expenses are payable in foreign currency 
we do not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not have a material impact on our future operating results or cash flows
