item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  we describe in detail the improvement in our operations during  following the substantial decline in sales in both the rv segment and the mh segment during the recession beginning in  and continuing through the first half of our net sales for reached million  percent higher than the million of net sales for this sales increase was largely the result of the percent increase in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  the company s primary market 
in addition  primarily as a result of new products  market share gains  and recent acquisitions  the company s product content for rvs increased percent in  compared to the company s rv segment represented percent of consolidated net sales in the company also increased its sales of aftermarket replacement components for both rvs and manufactured homes 
industry wide production of manufactured homes in increased percent from for  the company reported net income of million  or per diluted share

as reported in  excluding a goodwill impairment charge of million  net of taxes  or per diluted share  net income for was million  or per diluted share 
during  the company also incurred expenses totaling million  net of taxes  or per diluted share  resulting from plant closings and start ups  staff reductions and relocations  increased bad debts  and obsolete inventory and tooling  largely due to the unprecedented conditions in the rv and manufactured housing industries 
in february  the recreational vehicle industry association rvia published its latest forecast of industry wide wholesale shipments for  which projects a percent increase in the wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs as compared to assuming no change in dealer inventories  this projection implies a percent increase in retail activity in there is no assurance that these rv industry wide wholesale shipments or retail sales levels will be achieved 
there are no industry forecasts for the manufactured housing industry

in  the mh segment represented percent of the company consolidated net sales  and percent of consolidated segment operating profit 
certain of the company s mh segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes  and certain of the products manufactured by the company are suitable for both manufactured homes and modular homes

detailed narrative information about the results of operations of the mh segment is included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
sales and marketing other than the activities of its sales personnel and maintenance of customer relationships through price  quality of its products  service  and customer satisfaction  the company does not engage in significant marketing efforts  and does not incur significant marketing or advertising expenditures 
the company has several supply agreements or other arrangements with certain of its customers that provide for prices of various products to be fixed for periods generally not in excess of eighteen months  however  in certain cases the company has the right to renegotiate the prices on sixty days notice 
both the rv segment and the mh segment typically ship products on average within one to two weeks of receipt of orders from their customers and  as a result  neither segment has any significant backlog 
because of the seasonality of the rv and manufactured housing industries  historically  the company s operating results in the first and fourth quarters have been the weakest  while the second and third quarters are traditionally stronger 
however  because of fluctuations in rv dealer inventories since the fourth quarter of  seasonal industry trends have been different than in prior years 
capacity in  the company s facilities operated at an average of approximately percent of their practical capacity  and typically ran one shift of production per day 
due to seasonal demand  capacity utilization varies during the year 
capacity utilization also varies significantly by product line and geographic region 
during the second and third quarters of  the company experienced greater than anticipated increases in demand for certain products 
in order to increase production  the company incurred substantial overtime costs  employed temporary workers  and increased the number of shifts  all of which created inefficiencies  and  as a result  approximately million of excess production costs were incurred 
significant steps to control these costs have been implemented  including adding production capacity  and improving production flow and material usage 
the company believes it has the ability to substantially increase production should demand increase further in the rv or manufactured housing industries 
at december   the company operated facilities  and for most products has the ability to fill demand in excess of capacity at individual facilities by shifting production to other facilities  but the company would incur additional freight costs 
capital expenditures for were million 
the ability to expand capacity in certain product areas  if necessary  as well as the potential to reallocate existing resources  is monitored regularly by management to help ensure it can maintain a high level of production efficiencies throughout its operations

item a 
risk factors 
industry risk factors economic and business conditions beyond our control have had a significant adverse impact on our earnings  and could negatively impact our future results 
our net sales in fell percent compared to  which adversely impacted our operating results 
we attributed this decline to a combination of factors  including the weak economy and resulting recession  tight credit  reduced availability of home equity credit lines  high unemployment  low consumer confidence  and the deterioration in the real estate and mortgage markets 
as a result of these conditions  during dealers reduced inventories and consumers were cautious about making purchases of discretionary big ticket items such as rvs and manufactured homes 
although these conditions abated somewhat during  and our net sales in increased percent compared to  if the severity of these conditions resumes or worsens in the future  our earnings could be significantly impacted 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the long term decline in the retail demand and wholesale production of manufactured homes has reduced the demand for our manufactured housing products 
our annual results of operations could decline if manufactured housing industry conditions worsen 
reductions in the availability of wholesale financing limits the inventories carried by retail dealers of rvs and manufactured homes  which would cause reduced production of rvs and manufactured homes by our customers  and therefore reduced demand for our products 
retail dealers of rvs and manufactured homes generally finance their purchases of inventory with financing known as floor plan financing provided by lending institutions 
reduction in the availability of floor plan financing has caused  and would cause  many dealers to reduce inventories of rvs and manufactured homes  which would result in reduced production of rvs and manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
moreover  dealers which are unable to obtain adequate financing could cease operations 
their remaining inventories would likely be sold at deep discounts 
such sales would cause a decline in orders for new inventory  which would reduce demand for our products 
conditions in the credit market could limit the ability of consumers to obtain financing for rvs and manufactured homes  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
as a result of the recession and the factors leading to it  there have been significant changes in the lending practices of financial institutions  and many lenders have severely restricted loan availability 
limitations on the availability of financing for rvs and manufactured homes has limited  and could continue to limit  the ability of consumers to purchase rvs and manufactured homes  resulting in reduced production of rvs and manufactured homes by our customers  and therefore reduced demand for our products 
limited availability of financing for manufactured homes  and higher costs of financing  limits the ability of consumers to purchase manufactured homes  which would result in reduced demand for our products 
loans used to finance the purchase of manufactured homes usually have shorter terms and higher interest rates  and are more difficult to obtain than mortgages for site built homes 
historically  lenders required higher down payment  higher credit scores and other criteria for these loans 
current lending criteria are even higher  and many potential buyers of manufactured homes may not qualify 
the availability  cost  and terms of these loans are also dependent on economic conditions  lending practices of financial institutions  governmental policies  and other factors  all of which are beyond our control 
reductions in the availability of financing for manufactured homes and increases in the costs of this financing have limited  and could continue to limit  the ability of consumers to purchase manufactured homes  resulting in reduced production of manufactured homes by our customers  and therefore reduced demand for our products 
excess inventories at dealers and manufacturers can cause a decline in the demand for our products 
in response to a decline in retail sales of rvs and manufactured homes  dealers and manufacturers of rvs and manufactured homes could accumulate excess unsold inventory 
existence of excess inventory has caused  and would cause  a reduction in orders for new rvs and manufactured homes  which would cause a decline in demand for our products 
high levels of repossessions of manufactured homes and rvs could cause manufacturers to reduce production of new manufactured homes and rvs  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
repossessed manufactured homes and rvs are resold by lenders  often at substantially reduced prices  which reduces the demand for new manufactured homes and rvs 
economic conditions have resulted  and could continue to result  in loan defaults and cause high levels of repossessions  which would cause manufacturers to reduce production of new manufactured homes and rvs  resulting in reduced demand for our products 
gasoline shortages  or high prices for gasoline  could lead to reduced demand for our products 
travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs  components for which represent more than percent of our rv segment net sales  are usually towed by light trucks or suvs 
generally  these vehicles use more fuel than automobiles  particularly while towing rvs 
high prices for gasoline  or anticipation of potential fuel shortages  can affect consumer use and purchase of light trucks and suvs  which would result in reduced demand for fifth wheel rvs and travel trailers  and therefore reduced demand for our products 
the manufactured housing industry has been experiencing a significant decline in shipments  which may continue 
our mh segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for  operates in an industry which has been experiencing a decline in production of new homes since the downturn was caused  in part  by limited availability and high cost of financing for manufactured homes  and has been exacerbated by economic conditions 
moreover  because of the weak market for conventional housing  retirees may not be able to sell their primary residence  or may be unwilling to sell at currently depressed prices  and purchase less expensive manufactured homes 
in addition  the availability of foreclosed site built homes at reduced prices has impacted  and could continue to impact  the demand for manufactured homes 
if these conditions persist  it is not likely that the manufactured housing industry will improve in the short term 
certain of our manufactured housing customers have experienced financial difficulties and more of our manufactured housing customers may be similarly affected 
these factors could result in reduced demand for products from our mh segment  as well as difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
changes in zoning regulations for manufactured homes could lead to reduced demand for our products 
manufactured housing communities and individual home placements are subject to local zoning regulations 
there has been resistance by local property owners and zoning officials to zoning ordinances allowing the location of manufactured homes in certain areas comprised of conventional residences 
continued resistance to these zoning ordinances could have an adverse impact on sales and production of manufactured homes  which would reduce demand for our products 
company specific risk factors volatile raw material costs could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
the prices we pay for steel  which represents about percent of our raw material costs  and other key raw materials  have been volatile 
because competition and business conditions may limit the amount or timing of increases in raw material costs that can be passed through to customers in the form of selling price increases  future increases in raw material costs could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
conversely  as raw material costs decline  we may not be able to maintain selling prices consistent with higher cost raw materials in our inventory  which could adversely affect our operating results 
inadequate supply of raw materials used to make our products could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
if raw materials or components that are used in manufacturing our products  particularly those which we import  become unavailable  or if the supply of these raw materials and components is interrupted  our manufacturing operations could be adversely affected 
the company currently imports approximately percent of its raw materials and components 
we are involved in certain litigation  which  if decided against us  could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition 
a case was pending against kinro  purporting to be a class action  in which it was alleged that certain bathtubs manufactured by kinro for use in manufactured homes failed to comply with certain safety standards relating to flame spread 
kinro denied the allegations  vigorously defended against the claims and  based on extensive investigation  believes that the bathtubs were in compliance with applicable regulations 
the named plaintiffs asserted seven claims against kinro  all of which were dismissed by the court during the course of the proceedings 
the named plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal 
further detail regarding the litigation is provided in this form k in item legal proceedings 
the loss of any customer accounting for more than percent of our consolidated net sales  and the consolidation of customers in our industry  could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
one customer of the rv segment accounted for percent  and another customer of both the rv segment and the mh segment accounted for percent  of our consolidated net sales in the loss of either of these customers would have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
in the third quarter of  two of our customers  which together represented percent of our consolidated net sales  combined 
the concentration of sales of our products to fewer customers as a result of consolidation of manufacturers in the industries we serve could impact our sales prices  which would adversely impact our operating results 
the financial condition of our customers could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results 
financial difficulties experienced by certain of our customers could result in reduced demand for our products  as well as losses due to the inability to collect accounts receivable 
competitive pressures could reduce demand for our products 
domestic and foreign competitors may lower prices on products which currently compete with our products  or develop product improvements  which could reduce demand for our products 
in addition  the manufacture by our customers of products supplied by us could reduce demand for our products 
the loss of any of our key operating management could reduce our ability to execute our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we are dependent to a significant extent upon the efforts of our key operating management 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key operating management could impair our ability to execute our business strategy  which would have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition and results of operations

item legal proceedings 
on or about january   an action was commenced in the united states district court  central district of california  entitled  as amended  gonzalez and royalty vs 
drew industries incorporated  kinro  inc  kinro texas limited partnership d b a better bath components  skyline corporation  and skyline homes inc case no 
cv 
the case purported to be a class action 
at various times in the course of the proceedings during  the court dismissed each of the seven claims asserted by the named plaintiffs 
the named plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal  and their appeal briefs are due in may plaintiffs alleged that certain bathtubs manufactured by kinro texas limited partnership  a subsidiary of kinro  and sold under the name better bath for use in manufactured homes  failed to comply with certain safety standards relating to flame spread established by the us department of housing and urban development hud 
plaintiffs alleged  among other things  that sale of these products is in violation of various provisions of the california consumers legal remedies act cal

code sec 
et seq  the magnuson moss warranty act usc sec 
et seq  the california song beverly consumer warranty act cal

code sec 
et seq plaintiffs sought to require defendants to notify members of the class of the allegations in the proceeding and the claims made  to repair or replace the allegedly defective products  to reimburse members of the class for repair  replacement and consequential costs  to cease the sale and distribution of the allegedly defective products  and to pay actual and punitive damages and plaintiffs attorneys fees 
the company liability insurer denied coverage on the ground that plaintiffs did not sustain any personal injury or property damage 
kinro conducted a comprehensive investigation of the allegations made in connection with the claims  including with respect to the hud safety standards  test results  testing procedures  and the use of labels 
in addition  at kinro initiative  independent laboratories conducted multiple tests on materials used by kinro in the manufacture of bathtubs  the results of which tests indicate that kinro bathtubs are in compliance with hud regulations 
if the court of appeals reverses the district court s rulings  which dismissed all claims asserted by the named plaintiffs  and if plaintiffs pursue their claims  protracted litigation could result 
although the outcome of such litigation cannot be predicted  if certain essential findings are ultimately unfavorable to kinro  the company could sustain a material liability 
however  based upon all the developments in this case to date  the company believes that it will not incur a material liability in connection with this case 
in addition  in the normal course of business  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
all such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance 
while these matters could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods  it is management opinion that after final disposition  including anticipated insurance recoveries in certain cases  any monetary liability or financial impact to the company beyond that provided for in the consolidated balance sheets as of december   would not be material to the company financial position or annual results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
the company has two reportable segments  the recreational vehicle rv products segment the rv segment and the manufactured housing products segment the mh segment 
intersegment sales are insignificant 
the company s operations are conducted through its wholly owned operating subsidiaries  lippert components  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  lippert and kinro  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  kinro 
each has operations in both the rv and mh segments 
at december   the company operated plants in states 
the rv segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent for the rv segment manufactures a variety of products used primarily in the production of rvs  including towable steel chassis aluminum windows and screens towable axles and suspension solutions chassis components slide out mechanisms and solutions furniture and mattresses thermoformed bath  kitchen and other products entry and baggage doors toy hauler ramp doors entry steps patio doors other towable accessories manual  electric and hydraulic stabilizer specialty trailers for hauling boats  personal and lifting systems watercraft  snowmobiles and equipment the company also supplies certain of these products as replacement parts to the rv aftermarket 
more than percent of the company s rv segment net sales are components for travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs  with the balance primarily comprised of components for motorhomes and mid size buses  as well as sales of specialty trailers and related axles 
travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs accounted for percent of all rvs shipped by the industry in  up from percent in the mh segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent for  manufactures a variety of products used in the production of manufactured homes and to a lesser extent  modular housing and office units  including vinyl and aluminum windows and screens steel chassis thermoformed bath and kitchen products steel chassis parts steel and fiberglass entry doors axles aluminum and vinyl patio doors the company also supplies windows  doors  and thermoformed bath products as replacement parts to the manufactured housing aftermarket 
sales of products other than components for rvs and manufactured homes are not considered significant 
however  certain of the company s mh segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes  and certain of the products manufactured by the company are suitable for both manufactured homes and modular homes 
as a result  the company is not always able to determine in which type of home its products are installed 
because of the seasonality of the rv and manufactured housing industries  historically  the company s operating results in the first and fourth quarters have been the weakest  while the second and third quarters are traditionally stronger 
however  because of fluctuations in rv dealer inventories since the fourth quarter of  seasonal industry trends have been different than in prior years 
industry background recreational vehicle industry an rv is a vehicle designed as temporary living quarters for recreational  camping  travel or seasonal use 
rvs may be motorized motorhomes or towable travel trailers  fifth wheel travel trailers  folding camping trailers and truck campers 
according to the recreation vehicle industry association rvia  industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  the company s primary rv markets  increased percent to  units for compared to the increase in industry wide wholesale production in was due to the following in  because of severe economic conditions  including low consumer confidence  limited credit availability for both dealers and consumers  and continued weakness in the real estate and mortgage markets  retail demand declined and dealers reduced inventory levels by  units 
in  retail demand increased by  units  or percent  as compared to as a result of this improved retail demand  rv dealers increased inventory levels by  units in to  in december  rv dealers expressed their confidence by boosting purchases in anticipation of strong retail demand in the upcoming spring selling season 
while rv dealer purchases and inventory levels may continue to fluctuate  the company believes continued strength in retail sales is the key to an ongoing recovery in the rv industry 
although there are still uncertainties regarding future retail demand  recent reports of increased traffic and sales at consumer rv shows over the first few months of  as well as indications that credit availability has been improving  along with higher consumer confidence readings in five of the last six months  with the february reading being the highest reading since february  are all encouraging signs for the rv industry 
retail sales in the traditionally strong spring selling season will be a key indicator of consumer demand for rvs in continued increases in retail sales would spur dealer orders and factory production in while the company measures its rv sales against industry wide wholesale shipment statistics  it believes the underlying health of the rv industry is determined by retail demand 
a comparison of the year over year percentage change in industry wide wholesale shipments and retail sales of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  as reported by statistical surveys  inc  for both the united states and canada  is as follows wholesale retail unit impact on change change dealer inventories year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  the rvia has projected a percent increase in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs for  to  units 
assuming no change in dealer inventories  this projection implies a percent increase in retail activity of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs in consumer confidence and the availability of financing have historically been important factors in the overall growth in the rv industry  and although these factors improved in  there can be no assurance these factors will improve further in in the long term  the company expects rv industry sales to be driven by positive demographics  and the continued popularity of the rv lifestyle 
demand for rvs is strongest from the over age group  which is the fastest growing segment of the us population 
us census bureau projections released in december project that there will be million more people over the age of by further  the rvia has a generic advertising campaign promoting the rv lifestyle 
the current campaign is targeted at both parents aged with children at home  as well as couples aged with no children at home 
the popularity of traveling in rvs to nascar and other sporting events  more family oriented vacations  and using rvs as second homes  also appear to motivate consumer demand for rvs 
manufactured housing industry manufactured homes are built entirely in a factory on permanent steel undercarriages or chassis to which axles and wheels are attached 
the homes are then transported to a manufactured housing dealer which sells and transports the home to the buyer s home site 
the manufactured home is installed pursuant to a federal building code administered by the us department of housing and urban development hud 
the federal standards regulate manufactured housing design and construction  strength and durability  transportability  fire resistance  energy efficiency and quality 
the hud code also sets performance standards for the heating  plumbing  air conditioning  thermal and electrical systems 
it is the only federally regulated national building code 
on site additions  such as garages  decks and porches  often add to the attractiveness of manufactured homes and must be built to local  state or regional building codes 
a manufactured home may be sited on owned or leased land 
the institute for building technology and safety ibts reported that for  industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes were  units  an increase of one percent compared to this increase was apparently partially due to a tax credit for first time home buyers  which was available in the first half of  while industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes decreased percent in the second half of  as compared to the same period of  after the tax credit expired 
since  industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes have declined percent 
this decline was primarily the result of limited credit availability because of high credit standards applied to purchases of manufactured homes  high down payment requirements  and high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages for site built homes and loans for manufactured homes 
for the years prior to the sub prime boom in home financing  manufactured housing industry wide wholesale shipments represented percent or more of single family housing starts 
during the sub prime years  to  when extremely low cost loans were available for financing site built homes  many traditional buyers of manufactured homes were able to purchase site built homes instead of manufactured homes  and manufactured housing s share of the single family market dropped precipitously  to well below percent 
since the sub prime bubble burst in and  this market share has increased somewhat  to about percent  despite that interest rates for manufactured home loans remain historically high relative to rates for site built home loans 
accordingly  the company believes the manufactured housing industry may begin to experience a modest recovery when the economy improves and home buyers begin to look for affordable housing 
however  because of the current real estate and economic environment  including the availability of foreclosed site built homes at abnormally low prices  fluctuating consumer confidence  high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages for site built homes and loans for manufactured homes  and the current retail and wholesale credit markets  the company expects industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes to remain low until these conditions improve 
the company believes that long term growth prospects for manufactured housing may be positive because of i the quality and affordability of the homes  ii favorable demographic trends  including an increasing number of retirees who  in the past  had represented a significant market for manufactured homes  iii pent up demand by retirees who have been unable or unwilling to sell their primary residence and purchase a manufactured home  and iv the unavailability of sub prime mortgages for site built homes

net sales of the company s rv segment increased percent  compared to a percent increase in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs 
the rv segment represented percent of consolidated net sales in net sales of the company s manufactured housing segment increased percent  compared to a percent increase in industry wide production of manufactured homes 
the mh segment represented percent of consolidated net sales in because of the seasonality of the rv and manufactured housing industries  historically  the company s operating results in the first and fourth quarters have been the weakest  while the second and third quarters are traditionally stronger 
however  because of fluctuations in rv dealer inventories since the fourth quarter of  seasonal industry trends have been different than in prior years 
the company s net sales for the first two months of were million  a percent increase from the comparable period of this increase was despite the fact that sales in january were bolstered by inventory restocking by rv dealers following the drastic downturn of late and most of for  the company s net income increased to million  or per diluted share 
for the company reported a net loss of million  or per diluted share  including a goodwill impairment charge of million  net of taxes  or per diluted share  and extra expenses totaling million  net of taxes  or per diluted share  largely due to the unprecedented conditions in the rv and manufactured housing industries resulting from the severe economic downturn 
raw material costs as a percent of net sales have been volatile between quarters for the past two years 
after increasing as much as percent during the first part of  raw material costs  in particular steel  aluminum and abs resin prices  began to level off in the latter part of the second quarter of during the third quarter of  steel prices generally remained constant  however the cost of aluminum and certain other raw materials increased 
further  in november  our raw material costs  in particular steel  began to increase 
such increases have continued through march while the company has historically been able to obtain sales price increases to offset the majority of raw material cost increases  there can be no assurance that these cost increases  as well as future cost increases  if any  can be partially or fully passed on to customers  or that the timing of such increases will match the raw material cost increases 
also  to mitigate the impact of higher raw material costs  the company attempts to gain additional sales volume from customers 
further  the company continues to explore improved product design  efficiency improvements  and alternative sources of raw materials and components  both domestic and imported 
during  the company completed the acquisition of three businesses  for aggregate cash consideration of million paid at closing  and also acquired the exclusive rights to use a patent for million 
contingent earn outs related to those acquisitions could be paid over approximately the next years depending upon the level of sales generated from certain of the acquired products 
these acquisitions included a series of new patent pending rv products  including an innovative wall slide out mechanism  new leveling devices  a new power roof lift for tent campers  and an advanced remote locking system for entry doors  as well as an operation with the capability to customize standard chassis for motorhomes  transit buses and specialized commercial trucks 
on december   a special dividend of per share of the company s common stock  or an aggregate of million  was paid to stockholders of record as of december  at december   after payment of the special dividend  and the million of cash consideration for the acquisitions during  the company had million of cash and short term investments  no debt and substantial available borrowing capacity 
on january   the company acquired the operating assets and business of home style industries  and its affiliated companies 
home style manufactures a full line of upholstered furniture and mattresses primarily for towable rvs  in the northwest us market 
home style s sales for were million  which going forward would increase the company s content per travel trailer and fifth wheel rv by per unit 
the purchase price was million paid at closing from available cash 
rv segment net sales of the rv segment in increased percent  or million  compared to the company s sales growth exceeded the percent increase in industry wide wholesale production of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  largely due to the company s market share gains and new product introductions 
the company s sales of components for motorhomes in increased percent to million  compared to this was less than the percent increase in industry wide wholesale production of motorhomes because of the loss of market share by the company s motorhome customers 
however  in the past year the company has been expanding its product line of components for motorhomes in order to increase market penetration 
according to the rvia  industry wide wholesale shipments for the years ended december  were as follows change travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs motorhomes the trend in the company s average product content per rv produced is an indicator of the company s overall market share of components for new rvs 
content per rv is also impacted by changes in selling prices for the company s products 
the company s average product content per type of rv  calculated based upon the company s net sales of components for the different types of rvs produced for the years ended december  divided by the industry wide wholesale shipments of the different types of rvs for the years ended december  was change content per travel trailer and fifth wheel rv content per motorhome the company s average product content per type of rv excludes sales of replacement parts to the aftermarket  and sales to other industries 
in  the company refined the calculation of content per unit to better identify aftermarket sales  as well as sales to other industries 
this refinement had no impact on total rv segment sales or trends of content per unit 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
further  the company s rv segment sales of replacement parts in the aftermarket for existing rvs were approximately million for  an increase of percent from the company is increasing its efforts to gain market share in sales of replacement parts in the aftermarket 
operating profit of the rv segment was million in  an improvement of million compared to  largely due to the million increase in net sales 
the company incurred million of extra expenses in related to plant closings and start ups  staff reductions and relocations  increased bad debts  equipment write downs  and obsolete inventory and tooling  largely due to the unprecedented conditions in the rv industry at that time 
excluding these extra expenses in  the company s rv segment operating profit increased million from last year 
this adjusted increase in rv segment operating profit was percent of the increase in net sales  less than the company s expected percent incremental margin 
the operating margin of the rv segment in was negatively impacted by approximately million of excess production costs incurred as a result of greater than anticipated increases in demand for certain products 
in order to increase production  the company incurred substantial overtime costs  employed temporary workers  and increased the number of shifts  all of which created inefficiencies 
significant steps to control these costs have been implemented  including adding production capacity  and improving production flow and material usage 
higher incentive compensation compared to  when incentive compensation was lower than normal because operating profit for certain operations was below the previously established annual incentive compensation hurdles 
volatile raw material costs 
raw material costs as a percent of sales during were higher than during in november  the cost of key raw materials  consisting primarily of steel  vinyl  aluminum  glass and abs resin  once again began to increase 
such increases have continued through march partially offset by the spreading of fixed manufacturing and selling  general and administrative costs over a million larger sales base 
improved operating efficiencies in certain product lines due to the increase in sales 
at december   other intangible assets included million related to the company s marine and leisure operation  which sells trailers primarily for small and medium sized boats and related axles 
over the last few years  industry shipments of small and medium sized boats have declined significantly 
from time to time  throughout this period  the company conducted an impairment analysis on these operations  and the estimated fair value of these operations continued to exceed the corresponding book values  thus no impairment has been recorded 
a continued downturn in industry shipments of small and medium sized boats  or in the profitability of the company s operations  could result in a non cash impairment charge for the related other intangible assets in the future 
mh segment net sales of the mh segment for increased percent  or million  from this increase was significantly better than the one percent increase in industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes  largely as a result of new products  market share gains and increased sales of replacement parts to the aftermarket  partially offset by customer mix 
while industry wide shipments of manufactured homes in increased one percent compared to last year  industry wide shipments of larger  multi section homes  in which the company has more content  declined five percent  while smaller single section homes increased percent 
according to the ibts  industry wide wholesale shipments for the years ended december  were as follows change total homes produced total floors produced the trend in the company s average product content per manufactured home produced is an indicator of the company s overall market share of components for new manufactured homes 
manufactured homes contain one or more floors or sections which can be joined to make larger homes 
the larger homes typically contain more of the company s products 
content per manufactured home and content per floor are also impacted by changes in selling prices for the company s products 
the company s average product content per manufactured home produced by the industry and total manufactured home floors produced by the industry  calculated based upon the company s net sales of components for newly produced manufactured homes for the years ended december  divided by the number of manufactured homes and manufactured home floors produced by the industry  respectively  for the years ended december  was change content per home produced content per floor produced the company s average product content per manufactured home excludes sales of replacement parts to the aftermarket  and sales to other industries 
in  the company refined the calculation of content per unit to better identify aftermarket sales  as well as sales to other industries 
this refinement had no impact on total mh segment sales or trends of content per unit 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
net sales by the mh segment of replacement parts in the aftermarket increased percent from to approximately million in the company has increased its efforts to gain market share in sales of replacement parts in the aftermarket 
operating profit of the mh segment was million in  an increase of million compared to  partly due to the million increase in net sales 
in  the company incurred million of extra expenses related to plant closings and start ups  staff reductions and relocations and obsolete inventory  largely due to the unprecedented conditions in the manufactured housing industry at that time 
the operating margin of the mh segment in was positively impacted by volatile raw material costs 
for the full year  raw material costs as a percent of sales were lower than during however  in the second half of  raw material costs were higher than during the second half of  when raw material costs were unusually low 
further  in november  the cost of key raw materials  consisting primarily of steel  vinyl  aluminum  glass and abs resin  began to increase 
such increases have continued through march the spreading of fixed manufacturing and selling  general and administrative costs over a million larger sales base 
improved operating efficiencies due to the increase in sales 
partially offset by higher incentive compensation compared to  when incentive compensation was lower than normal because operating profit for certain operations was below the previously established annual incentive compensation hurdles 
corporate corporate expenses for increased million compared to  due primarily to an increase in performance based incentive compensation as a result of higher profits 
also  in connection with the special cash dividend of per share of the company s common stock declared and paid in december  the compensation committee of the company s board of directors reduced the exercise price of all the outstanding stock options by per share 
as a result of this stock option modification  the company recorded a charge of million in other non segment items other non segment items include the following in thousands year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses net loss on sold facilities and write downs to estimated current fair value of facilities to be sold net gain on insurance claim earn outs fair value adjustment earn outs accretion incentive compensation impact of other non segment items other expenses  net other income from the collection of a previously reserved note total other non segment items in connection with certain of the acquisitions completed over the last two years  the company is required to record an expense  or accretion  equivalent to interest on the recorded liability for future earn out payments 
accretion expense was million for  and is estimated to be approximately million in in addition  each quarter the company is required to re evaluate the fair value of the liability for estimated earn out payments based upon the projected timing and extent of future sales  as well as the discount rate 
depending upon the discount rate and future sales of the products which are subject to earn outs  the company could record adjustments in future periods 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated highlights during the first six months of  as a result of the economic downturn and the resulting severe declines in industry wide wholesale shipments by the rv and manufactured housing industries  the company experienced a percent decline in net sales  from million in the first six months of to million in the first six months of as a result  in the first six months of  the company reported a net loss of million  including an after tax charge of million for goodwill impairment  as compared to net income of million in the first six months of during the second half of  industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs  the company s primary rv market  increased percent compared to the second half of  offset by a decline in manufactured housing industry wide wholesale shipments of percent 
as a result  the company s net sales increased to million in the second half of  percent more than in the comparable period of the company reported net income of million in the second half of as compared to a net loss of million in the comparable period of  which included an after tax charge of million for goodwill impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of in response to the impact of the recession  the company focused on increasing market share for existing products  introducing new products  reducing fixed costs  improving efficiencies  and strengthening its financial condition 
in  the company identified and introduced new and improved rv products that focused on consumer safety and convenience  including the quick bitetm coupler  an improved suspension system  entry doors with alarm systems and keyless entry  and a new look line of windows 
as a result  the company s rv segment continued to achieve market share gains 
in july  a supplier of manufactured housing windows and doors exited the market 
since then  the company has gained new window business of more than million on an annualized basis 
in addition  in september  the company purchased production equipment and inventory for manufactured housing entry doors from the same supplier  and began production during the fourth quarter of  entering a new market  estimated to be million to million 
approximately half of this new potential is in aftermarket replacement entry doors for manufactured homes 
the decline in the company s results for would have been substantially greater had it not been for an aggressive program of cost cutting measures and efficiency improvements implemented beginning in the latter part of cost reduction measures benefitted the company s operating results in by million  compared to collectively  the fixed cost reductions since have improved the company s annual operating profit by over million compared to results if these steps had not been taken 
the company anticipates that a significant portion of the fixed cost reductions and production efficiencies implemented will continue  even as sales increase 
during and  as a result of the unprecedented conditions in the rv and manufactured housing industries  and the cost cutting measures taken by management  the company recorded million and million  respectively  of extra expenses 
these extra expenses resulted primarily from the following in millions plant closings and start ups obsolete equipment  inventory and tooling staff reductions and relocations executive retirement other during  the company continued to generate significant cash flow  increasing cash and short term investments by nearly million  to over million  and paying off the entire million debt balance that existed at december  this was largely accomplished by cash flows provided by operating activities of million  including a reduction in inventory of more than million 
steel and aluminum are among the company s principal raw materials 
since late  the costs of steel and aluminum have been volatile 
during the first half of  raw material costs temporarily declined  but subsequently increased percent to percent in the second half of  depending upon the type of raw material  but did not have a significant impact on the second half of as the lower priced raw materials were consumed first  and the higher priced raw materials remained in inventory 
rv segment net sales of the rv segment in decreased percent  or million  compared to due to an organic sales decline excluding the impact of acquisitions and sales price changes of approximately million 
this percent organic sales decline during was due to the percent decrease in industry wide wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs  the company s primary rv market 
during the first six months of the organic sales decline of rv related products was approximately million  or percent 
however  this was partially offset by an organic sales increase of approximately million  or percent  of rv related products in the second half of an organic sales decline of approximately percent or million in specialty trailers due primarily to a severe industry wide decline in sales of small and medium size boats  particularly on the west coast  the company s primary specialty trailer market 
partially offset by full year impact in of sales from acquisitions completed in  aggregating approximately million 
sales price increases of approximately million  primarily due to raw material cost increases in according to the rvia  industry wide wholesale shipments for the years ended december  were as follows change travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs motorhomes the trend in the company s average product content per rv produced is an indicator of the company s overall market share of components for new rvs 
content per rv is also impacted by changes in selling prices for the company s products 
the company s average product content per type of rv  calculated based upon the company s net sales of components for the different types of rvs produced for the years ended december  divided by the industry wide wholesale shipments of the different types of rvs for the years ended december  was change content per travel trailer and fifth wheel rv content per motorhome the company s average product content per type of rv excludes sales of replacement parts to the aftermarket  and sales to other industries

this refinement had no impact on total rv segment sales or trends of content per unit 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
the company s rv segment aftermarket sales were approximately million for  consistent with operating profit of the rv segment in decreased million compared to  largely due to the million decline in net sales  and million of extra expenses in related to plant closings and start ups  staff reductions and relocations  increased bad debts  and obsolete inventory and tooling  compared to million of extra expenses in excluding extra expenses  the company s rv segment had an operating profit of million in  a decrease of million from the segment operating profit of million in this adjusted decline in rv segment operating profit was percent of the organic decline in net sales  a smaller percentage decline than the company would typically expect 
the operating margin of the rv segment in was positively impacted by implementation of cost cutting measures which reduced cost of sales 
lower health insurance costs largely due to the implementation of a new plan 
lower warranty costs 
lower raw material costs in the second half of compared to the same period of when raw material costs were unusually high  partially offset by higher raw material costs during the first six months of partially offset by the spreading of fixed manufacturing costs over a smaller sales base 
higher overtime and labor inefficiencies due to rapid changes in sales volumes 
excluding the extra expenses  an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to percent of net sales in from percent of net sales in  largely due to the spreading of fixed administrative costs over a smaller sales base  partially offset by the implementation of fixed cost reductions 
in addition  incentive compensation was lower as a percent of sales in because incentive compensation is only recorded on operating profit in excess of pre established hurdles 
mh segment net sales of the mh segment in decreased percent  or million  from excluding million in sales price increases  net sales of the mh segment declined percent  consistent with the decrease in industry wide wholesale shipments of manufactured homes 
according to the ibts  industry wide wholesale shipments for the years ended december  were as follows change total homes produced total floors produced in july  a supplier of manufactured housing windows and doors exited the market 
since then  the company has gained new window business of more than million annually  partially offsetting the other declines 
in addition  in september  the company purchased production equipment and inventory for manufactured housing entry doors from the same supplier  and began production during the fourth quarter of  entering a new market  estimated to be million to million 
approximately half of this new potential is in aftermarket replacement entry doors for manufactured homes 
the company s mh segment aftermarket sales  primarily comprised of windows and thermoformed bath products  were approximately million for  consistent with the trend in the company s average product content per manufactured home produced is an indicator of the company s overall market share of components for new manufactured homes 
manufactured homes contain one or more floors or sections which can be joined to make larger homes 
the larger homes typically contain more of the company s products 
content per manufactured home and content per floor are also impacted by changes in selling prices for the company s products 
the company s average product content per manufactured home produced by the industry and total manufactured home floors produced by the industry  calculated based upon the company s net sales of components for newly produced manufactured homes for the year ended december  divided by the number of manufactured homes and manufactured home floors produced by the industry  respectively  for the year ended december  was change content per home produced content per floor produced the company s average product content per manufactured home excludes sales of replacement parts to the aftermarket  and sales to other industries 
in  the company refined the calculation of content per unit to better identify aftermarket sales  as well as sales to other industries 
this refinement had no impact on total mh segment sales or trends of content per unit 
prior periods have been reclassified to conform to this presentation 
operating profit of the mh segment in decreased million compared to  largely due to the million decline in net sales 
in addition  the company had million and million of extra expenses in and  respectively  related to plant closings and start ups  staff reductions and relocations  and obsolete inventory 
excluding extra expenses  the company s mh segment had an operating profit of million in  a decrease of million from the segment operating profit of million in the same period last year 
the adjusted decline in mh segment operating profit was percent of the organic decline in net sales  a smaller percentage decline than the company would typically expect 
the operating margin of the mh segment in was positively impacted by implementation of cost cutting measures which reduced cost of sales 
lower raw material costs 
lower health insurance costs largely due to the implementation of a new plan 
partially offset by the spreading of fixed manufacturing costs over a smaller sales base 
labor inefficiencies due to the sharp drop in sales 
excluding the extra expenses  an increase in selling  general and administrative expenses to percent of net sales in from percent of net sales in due largely to the spreading of fixed administrative costs over a smaller sales base  partially offset by fixed cost reductions 
also  incentive compensation was lower as a percent of sales in because year to date operating profit for certain mh segment operations were below the previously established annual incentive compensation hurdles 
corporate corporate expenses for decreased million compared to due primarily to fixed cost reductions 
goodwill impairment during the first quarter of  because the company s stock price on the new york stock exchange was below its book value  and due to the continued declines in industry wide wholesale shipments of rvs and manufactured homes  the company conducted an impairment analysis of the goodwill of each of its reporting units 
the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated with a discounted cash flow model utilizing internal forecasts and observable market data  to the extent available  to estimate future cash flows  and the company s weighted average cost of capital of percent 
the forecast included an estimate of long term future growth rates based on management s most recent views of the long term outlook for each reporting unit 
based on the analyses  the carrying value of the rv and manufactured housing reporting units exceeded their fair value 
as a result  the company performed the second step of the impairment test  which required the company to determine the fair value of each reporting unit s assets and liabilities  including all of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of each reporting unit  excluding goodwill 
the results of the second step implied that the fair value of goodwill was zero  therefore during the first quarter of  the company recorded a non cash impairment charge to write off the entire million of goodwill of these reporting units 
other non segment items other non segment items include the following in thousands year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses legal proceedings gain on sold facilities loss on sold facilities and write downs to estimated current fair value of facilities to be sold incentive compensation impact of other non segment items other expenses  net executive retirement other income from the collection of a previously reserved note total other non segment items interest expense  net interest expense  net  for was million  primarily consisting of commitment and letter of credit fees under the line of credit  partially offset by interest income 
interest income for on the company s cash and investments was not significant  due to low interest rates and the company s policy of investing in only extremely safe investments 
the million decrease in interest expense  net  for as compared to  was partially due to a decrease in the average debt levels in the company earned less than million in interest income in  while the company earned million in interest income in provision for income taxes the effective tax rate for was percent  benefiting from a higher federal domestic manufacturing credit  as compared to percent for  excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment charge 
the annual effective tax rate for is expected to be percent to percent 
the effective tax rate for was percent  which was a combination of a percent rate on the goodwill impairment charge  and a percent rate for the remaining pre tax income 
a portion of the goodwill impairment charge is not deductible for tax purposes  which reduced the tax benefit recorded 
the percent rate on the remaining pre tax income was consistent with the percent rate for  as the tax rate benefits from federal tax credits and tax reserve adjustments were offset by the negative impact of lower pre tax income on permanent tax differences 
in connection with a tax audit  and after several negotiations  the company and the indiana department of revenue settled tax years to for million  as well as tax years to for million  including interest

it also clarifies guidance related to determining the appropriate classes of assets and liabilities and the information to be provided for valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
the guidance with respect to significant transfers in and out of levels and was effective for interim or annual periods beginning after december  the adoption of this portion of the guidance had no impact on the company 
the guidance with respect to level fair value measurements is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  and is not expected to have an impact on the company

critical accounting policies the company consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the critical accounting policies 
accounts receivable the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts that reduces accounts receivables to amounts that are expected to be collected 
in assessing the collectability of its accounts receivable  the company considers such factors as the current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical experience with write offs and the level of past due amounts 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be required 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
to the extent that actual demand or market conditions in the future differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded inventory reserves may be required 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by third party claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be required 
warranty the company provides warranty terms based upon the type of product that is sold 
the company estimates the warranty accrual based upon various factors  including i historical warranty experience  ii product mix  and iii sales patterns 
the accounting for warranty accruals requires the company to make assumptions and judgments  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be required 
income taxes the company tax provision benefit is based on pre tax income loss  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining the tax provision benefit and in evaluating the company tax position 
the company establishes additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that the tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain tax positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
the company adjusts these tax accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
the effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the expected outcome of tax audits 
the company accompanying consolidated balance sheets also include deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences  which are expected to reduce future taxable income 
these assets are based on management estimate of realizability  which is reassessed each quarter based upon the company forecast of future taxable income 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets  and may result in the recognition of a valuation reserve 
for additional information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets  including other intangible assets the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances occur  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset carrying value over its fair value would be recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of their cash inflows and outflows several years into the future 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
impairment of goodwill goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
the company conducts its required annual impairment test as of november th each fiscal year 
the impairment test uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit 
this model requires the use of long term forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
in  the company conducted its annual impairment analysis of the goodwill in all reporting units  which resulted in the impairment and non cash write off of the entire million of goodwill related to the specialty trailer reporting unit 
during the first quarter of  because the company s stock price on the new york stock exchange was below its book value  and due to the continued declines in industry wide wholesale shipments of rvs and manufactured homes  the company also conducted an impairment analysis of the goodwill of each of its reporting units  resulting in the impairment and non cash write off of the remaining million of goodwill 
in both periods  the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated with a discounted cash flow model utilizing internal forecasts and observable market data  to the extent available  to estimate future cash flows 
the forecast included an estimate of long term future growth rates based on management s most recent views of the long term outlook for each reporting unit 
at march  and november   the discount rate used in the discounted cash flow model prepared for the goodwill impairment analysis was percent and percent  respectively  derived by applying the weighted average cost of capital model  which weights the cost of debt and equity financing 
the company also considered the relationship of debt to equity of other similar companies  as well as the risks and uncertainty inherent in the markets generally and in the company s internally developed forecasts 
based on the analyses  the carrying value of the rv  manufactured housing and specialty trailer reporting units exceeded their fair value 
as a result  the company performed the second step of the impairment test  which required the company to determine the fair value of each reporting unit s assets and liabilities  including all of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets of each reporting unit  excluding goodwill 
the results of the second step implied that the fair value of goodwill was zero  therefore the company recorded a non cash impairment charge to write off the entire goodwill of the specialty trailer reporting unit in the fourth quarter of  and the rv and manufactured housing reporting units in the first quarter of these non cash goodwill impairment charges were largely the result of uncertainties in the economy  and in the rv  manufactured housing and marine and leisure industries  as well as the discount rates used to determine the present value of projected cash flows 
estimating the fair value of reporting units  and the reporting unit s asset and liabilities  involves the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including actual operating results  future business plans  economic projections and market data 
actual results may differ from forecasted results 
the company has elected to perform its annual goodwill impairment procedures for all of its reporting units as of november  and therefore  the company updated its carrying value calculations and fair value estimates for each of its reporting units as of november  based on the comparison of the carrying values to the estimated fair values  the company has concluded that no goodwill impairment existed at that time 
the company plans to update its review as of november   or sooner  if events occur or circumstances change that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
legal contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company formally evaluates pending proceedings  lawsuits and other claims with counsel 
these contingencies require management s judgment in assessing the likelihood of adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
earn out payments in connection with several acquisitions completed in and  in addition to the cash paid at closing  additional amounts could be paid over the next years depending upon the level of sales generated from certain of the acquired products 
the fair value of the aggregate estimated earn out payments has been recorded as a liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
each quarter  the company is required to re evaluate the fair value of the liability for the estimated earn out payments for such acquisitions 
the fair value of the earn out payments is estimated using a discounted cash flow model 
this model involves the use of estimates and significant judgments that are based on a number of factors including sales of certain products  future business plans  economic projections  discount rate  and market data 
actual results may differ from forecasted results 
other estimates the company makes a number of other estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business including  but not limited to  those related to product returns  accounts receivable  notes receivable  lease terminations  asset retirement obligations  post retirement benefits  stock based compensation  segment allocations  environmental liabilities  and contingencies 
establishing reserves for these matters requires management estimate and judgment with regard to risk and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are based on management current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may also be developed in conjunction with outside advisors  as appropriate 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
inflation the prices of key raw materials  consisting primarily of steel  vinyl  aluminum  glass and abs resin  are influenced by demand and other factors specific to these commodities  such as the price of oil  rather than being directly affected by inflationary pressures 
prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile 
in november  the cost of these key raw materials again began to increase  and have continued to increase through march the company did not experience any significant increase in its labor costs in related to inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company has historically been exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing activities 
at december   the company had no outstanding borrowings 
at december   the company had million of cash equivalents and million of short term investments in us treasuries 
due to the short term nature of the company s cash equivalents and short term investments  the exposure to changes in interest rates is minimal 
additional information required by this item is included under the caption inflation in item of this report
