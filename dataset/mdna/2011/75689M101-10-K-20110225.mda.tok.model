item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of december   we owned and operated or franchised red robin restaurants in states and canada  of which were company owned and were operated under franchise 
for the fiscal year  we plan to open new company owned red robin restaurants and we believe our franchisees will open about three to four new restaurants 
our primary source of revenue is from the sale of food and beverages at company owned restaurants 
we also earn revenue from royalties and fees from franchised restaurants 
the following summarizes the operational and financial highlights of fiscal year and our outlook comparable restaurant revenue 
for the fifty two weeks ended december   the restaurants in our current comparable base experienced a decrease in sales from these same restaurants last year 
this decrease was comprised of a increase in guest counts that was more than fully offset by a decrease in price and mix of 
during fiscal  we experienced four quarters of positive guest counts  reversing the negative trend that began in early and continued in we attribute this increased guest count to our marketing efforts and a stronger macroeconomic environment 
the decline in pricing is also primarily the result of our limited time offer lto promotions lower price point and negative revenue impact of changes in product mix 
in the third and fourth quarter both guest counts and overall comparable sales were positive 
marketing efforts 
in  our marketing strategy was focused on product news with an emphasis on quality  value  and variety to drive guest traffic  retention  and loyalty  which are key components of our yummm advertising campaign 
during  we launched three lto promotions featuring two products at a price point price point in the first lto promotion 
for the fiscal year ended december   our television advertising support of our lto promotions increased our total marketing spend to million 
we believe our lto promotions  supported by national television and digital advertising  contributed to our increased guest counts and restaurant sales 
restaurant sales and guest counts during the promotional campaigns ran higher than pre and post promotional periods 
in addition  our guest counts exceeded reported competitor guest traffic after our tv campaign began 
we will continue our lto promotional strategy supported with television advertising in which we expect to be equal to approximately of restaurant revenues in 
table of contents food costs 
during  we saw an increase in the price of ground beef and produce compared to prices 
we bought our ground beef on the spot market in at prices significantly in excess of prices 
we experienced an increase in produce costs due to inclement weather during pricing on our overall commodity basket on a blended basis is expected to increase to in we will continue to see pressure from ground beef  which is expected to be above average price by between and 
in response to these rising commodity costs  we are expecting to take about a price increase in april 
we also expect to begin to see the benefit in from having consolidated our distribution system in and other cost reduction initiatives associated with project red 
labor 
labor costs as a percentage of revenue increased in fiscal year by as a percentage of restaurant revenues primarily due to increase in manager bonuses as a percentage of average restaurant sales volumes 
labor costs are expected to be impacted in by minimum wage increases in certain states  in addition to increases in benefits and taxes 
new restaurant openings 
we opened new company owned restaurants during fiscal year in the near term  we are expecting development plans to be similar to as we seek to deploy our capital conservatively while maintaining restaurant growth 
we plan on opening new company owned restaurants in we believe we will fund all costs for restaurant development to be funded from our operating cash flow 
asset impairment 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that four company owned restaurants were impaired 
the company recognized a non cash impairment pre tax charge of million related to the impairment of these four restaurants 
we reviewed each restaurant past and present operating performance combined with projected future results  primarily through projected undiscounted cash flows  which indicated possible impairment 
the carrying amount of each restaurant was compared to its fair value as determined by management 
the impairment charge represents the excess of each restaurant carrying amount over its fair value 
executive transition 
stephen e 
carley was appointed as chief executive officer of the company and as a member of the board  effective as of september  in connection with the appointment of mr 
carley as the company new chief executive officer  the company also announced the retirement of dennis b 
mullen  the former chief executive officer 
million in pre tax charges related to executive transition were recorded to selling  general and administrative expense primarily in the fiscal third quarter

the decrease in average comparable restaurant weekly sales in fiscal year was primarily the result of a decrease in average guest check during from our lto promotions 
franchise royalties and fees consist primarily of royalty income and initial franchise fees  increased million or  from the year over year increase in franchise royalties and fees is primarily attributable to the overall increase in reported franchise sales 
our franchisees reported that comparable sales increased for us restaurants and decreased for canadian restaurants in the year ended december  franchise royalties and fees for decreased over due primarily to overall decrease in reported franchise sales 

table of contents other revenue consists primarily of gift card breakage 
we recognize restaurant revenue when a gift card is redeemed by a guest 
gift card breakage revenue is recognized if the likelihood of gift card redemption is remote and we determine that there is not a legal obligation to remit the unredeemed gift card balance to the relevant jurisdiction 
we base the gift card breakage rate upon specific historical redemption patterns 
we recognize gift card breakage by applying our estimate of the rate of gift card breakage over the period of estimated performance 
the company completed its initial analysis of unredeemed gift card liabilities for gift cards that it sold in its restaurants during the first quarter  and we recognized million as a onetime pre tax revenue adjustment during the fiscal first quarter we recognized million inclusive of the onetime revenue adjustment of gift card breakage for fiscal year costs and expenses cost of sales in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change cost of sales as a percent of restaurant revenue cost of sales  comprised of food and beverage costs  is variable and generally fluctuates with sales volume

asset impairment charge and restaurant closure costs during the third quarter of fiscal  we determined that four company owned restaurants were impaired 
the company recognized a non cash pre tax impairment charge of million related to these four restaurants 
we reviewed each restaurant past and present operating performance combined with projected future results  primarily through projected undiscounted cash flows  which indicated impairment 
the carrying amount of each restaurant was compared to its fair value as determined by management 
the impairment charge represents the excess of each restaurant carrying amount over its fair value 
we closed three and four restaurants in fiscal and  respectively 
the locations closed represented restaurants operating below acceptable profitability levels or were older restaurants whose leases were not extended or were in need of significant capital improvements that were not projected to provide acceptable returns in the foreseeable future 
we recognized charges of  and  in fiscal and  respectively  related to lease terminations and other closing related costs 
these three closed restaurants in were not part of the impairment charge taken in the third quarter of fiscal in we recognized million of asset impairment charges related to the write down of the carrying value of a portion of long lived assets associated with the four restaurants closed in in addition to the impairment charges related to the restaurant closures  we recognized million of non cash impairment charges in for two restaurants that were not meeting acceptable cash flow levels 
there were no asset impairment charges recognized in reacquired franchise costs as a result of the acquisition of the restaurants during  we incurred a total charge of  which is primarily related to avoided franchise fees 
the guidance for accounting for business 
table of contents combinations requires that a business combination between two parties that have a preexisting relationship be evaluated to determine if a settlement of a preexisting relationship exists 
the  charge reflects the lower royalty rates applicable to certain of the acquired restaurants compared to a standard royalty rate the company would receive under the company current royalty agreements 
see note  acquisition of red robin franchised restaurants  in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the acquisition and related charge

interest expense in was lower than due to reduced outstanding borrowings under our credit facility offset by a slightly higher weighted average interest rate of versus in interest expense in was lower than due to reduced outstanding borrowings under our credit facility and a lower weighted average interest rate of versus in we believe interest expense will increase in as we refinance our current credit facility at potentially higher interest rates 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased million  to a tax benefit of million in  from tax expense of million in our effective income tax rate was  a tax benefit  for   a tax expense  for  and  a tax expense  for the decreases in versus and versus were primarily due to the impact of more favorable general business and tax credits  primarily the fica tip tax credit  as a percent of current year income  which did not change at the same rate as the decrease in income 
liquidity and capital resources general 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december   from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this decrease in our cash position is the net result of million of cash provided by operating activities  offset by million used for the construction of new restaurants and expenditures for facility improvements  and million net pay down of debt 
we expect to continue to reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new restaurants or enhance existing restaurants  make investments in our technology infrastructure  pay down debt  and repurchase some of our outstanding common stock subject to appropriate valuation of our stock and other standard considerations 
credit facility 
our existing credit facility has permitted us to have a more flexible capital structure and facilitate our growth plans 
the credit facility is comprised of i a million revolving credit facility maturing on june   and ii a million term loan maturing on june   both with rates based on the london interbank offered rate libor plus a margin that is currently 
the credit agreement also allows us  subject to lender participation which is at their sole discretion  to increase the revolving credit facility by up to an additional million in the future and to request maturity extensions 
as part of the credit agreement  we may also request the issuance of up to million in letters of credit  the outstanding amount of which reduces the net borrowing capacity under the agreement 
the credit facility requires the payment of an annual commitment fee based upon the unused portion of the credit facility 
the credit facility interest rates and the annual commitment rate are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
our obligations under the credit facility are secured by first priority liens and security interests in the capital stock of subsidiaries of the company 
additionally  the credit agreement includes a negative pledge on all tangible and intangible assets of the company and its subsidiaries including all real and personal property with customary exceptions 
our credit facility is with a consortium of banks that include wells fargo bank na formerly wachovia bank na  bank of america na  keybank na  and suntrust 
table of contents bank  national association suntrust among others 
we do not believe that any of our lenders will not be able to fulfill their lending commitments under our credit facility 
in anticipation of expiration of the credit facility  we have begun discussions with our current lenders to refinance the credit facility in  and are considering options in connection therewith 
with regard to the current term loan facility  we are required to repay the principal amount of the term loan in consecutive quarterly installments which began september  and will end on the maturity date of the term loan 
at december   we had million of borrowings outstanding under our term loan  and million of borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding under our million revolving credit facility 
loan origination costs associated with the credit facility and the net outstanding balance of costs related to the original agreement and subsequent amendment to the credit facility are  and are included as deferred costs in other assets  net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  we expect to incur loan origination and similar costs in connection with the refinancing 
covenants 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our various credit agreements  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  and dividend payments 
in addition  we are required to maintain two financial ratios a leverage ratio calculated as our debt outstanding including issued standby letters of credit divided by the last twelve months earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization adjusted for certain non cash charges  and a fixed charge ratio calculated as our consolidated cash flow divided by our consolidated debt service obligations 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants and expect to remain in compliance with our current credit agreements through fiscal year debt outstanding 
total debt outstanding decreased million to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to our scheduled debt repayments of million and additional repayments of million  as well as payments on our capital lease obligations of approximately million 
our current credit agreement matures in and we expect to refinance our current credit facility to take advantage of the current low interest rate environment and maintain the financial flexibility we need to build our business in the future 
the company believes this refinancing will be completed in contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other non current liabilities total contractual obligations long term debt obligations represent borrowings under our credit agreement including interest of million based on a average borrowing interest rate

this table excludes contingent rents  including amounts which are determined as a percentage of adjusted sales in excess of specified levels 
purchase obligations include commitments for the construction of new restaurants and other capital improvement projects and lease commitments for company owned restaurants where leases have been executed but construction has not begun 
excluded are any agreements that are cancelable without significant penalty 
while we have fixed price agreements and contracts with spot market prices relating to food costs  we do not have any material contracts either individually or in the aggregate in place committing us to a minimum or fixed level of purchases 
other noncurrent liabilities include executive deferred compensation  accrued restaurant bonuses for long term incentive plans  uncertain tax positions  and vendor deposits 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  including capital lease obligations  were million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
fiscal year  compared with fiscal year  includes lower expenditures for new restaurants as well as reductions in facility improvements 
the decrease in cash flows utilized in compared with includes lower expenditures for new restaurants as well as reductions in facility improvements 
in fiscal year  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately to million 
in addition to the construction of new restaurants  we will continue our investment in restaurant remodels and capital improvements 
we will also make significant investments in our data infrastructure including the replacement of several key operational and financial systems 
stock repurchase 
during  we purchased a total of  shares of our common stock for approximately million with an average purchase price of per share 
also during  the company board of directors authorized an additional repurchase of up to million of the company equity securities of which repurchases may be made from time to time in open market transactions and through privately negotiated transactions through december  no shares were repurchased under the plan through fiscal year the company intends to spend up to million to repurchase common stock funded by operating cash flow and available credit in the first six months of  subject to appropriate valuation of the company shares and other standard considerations 
option tender offer 
during the first quarter  we completed a cash tender offer for out of the money stock options held by then current employees 
as a result of the tender offer  we incurred a one time pre tax charge of million for all unvested eligible options that were tendered 
this one time charge represents the compensation expense related to the acceleration of vesting on the unvested options tendered in the offer  which would otherwise have been expensed over their vesting period in the future if they had not been tendered 
approximately million of the million charge is recorded in labor expense and the remaining million is recorded in selling  general and administrative expense in our condensed consolidated statements of income 
we paid million in cash for the approximate million options tendered in the offer 
financial condition and future liquidity 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  support for infrastructure needs  and for general operating purposes 
in addition  we have and may continue to use capital repurchase our common stock 
our primary short term and long term sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet debt service  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
the company and the restaurant industry in general maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors generally grant trade credit for purchases  such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new restaurants 
table of contents and refurbishment of existing restaurants  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
we typically maintain current liabilities in excess of our current assets which results in a working capital deficit 
we are able to operate with a substantial working capital deficit because restaurant operations are primarily conducted on a cash basis 
rapid turnover results in limited investment in inventories  and cash from sales is usually received before related accounts payable for food  supplies and payroll become due 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor costs  energy costs  and materials used in the construction of new restaurants 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage have directly affected our labor costs in recent years 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation had a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in fiscal year  due primarily to higher costs for certain supplies  and commodity prices for certain foods we purchased at market rates 
our ground beef  which is purchased on the spot market  has consistently been higher than prices  our hamburger costs as a percentage of revenue were higher than uncertainties related to fluctuations in costs  including energy costs  commodity prices  annual indexed wage increases and construction materials make it difficult to predict what impact  if any  inflation may have on our business during  but it is anticipated that inflation will continue to have a negative impact in fiscal year seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season 
as a result  our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality 
accordingly  results for any one quarter or year are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year  and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the following as the company most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company financial condition and results and require management most subjective and complex judgment 
information regarding the company other significant accounting policies is disclosed in note  description of business and summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  including restaurant sites  leasehold improvements  other fixed assets  and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed when indicators of impairment are present 
expected cash flows associated with an asset are the key factor in determining the recoverability of the asset 
identifiable cash flows are generally measured at the restaurant level 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  including assumptions on future revenue trends 
management estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  changes to our business model  or changes in operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 

table of contents judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
during  we determined that four company owned restaurants were impaired 
the company recognized a non cash impairment pre tax charge of million related to the impairment of these four restaurants 
during  we recorded million pre tax of impairments of certain long lived restaurants for six restaurants 
we may record future impairments for restaurants whose operating performance falls below current expectations 
we have followed a consistent approach to evaluating whether there are impairments of long lived assets 
the company makes adjustments to assumptions to reflect management view of current market and economic conditions and with respect to conditions at specific locations 
goodwill 
we evaluate goodwill annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
we performed step one of the impairment test as of december  step one of the impairment test is based upon a comparison of the carrying value of our net assets  including goodwill balances  to the fair value of our net assets 
fair value is measured using a combination of the market capitalization method  the income approach  and the market approach 
the market capitalization method uses the company stock price and a control premium to derive fair value 
the income approach consists of utilizing the discounted cash flow method that incorporates our estimates of future revenues and costs  discounted using a risk adjusted discount rate 
our estimates used in the income approach are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage operations 
the market approach utilizes multiples of profit measures in order to estimate the fair value of the assets 
we do evaluate all methods to ensure reasonably consistent results 
additionally  we evaluate the key input factors in the models used to determine whether a moderate change in any input factor or combination of factors would significantly change the results of the tests 
based on the completion of the step one test  we determined that goodwill was not impaired as of december   as the percentage by which the fair value exceeded the carrying value was approximately 
however  an impairment charge may be triggered in the future  if the value of our stock declines  sales in our restaurants decline beyond current forecast  or if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment of the restaurant industry 
we have followed a consistent approach to evaluating whether there are impairments of goodwill 
the company makes adjustments to assumptions to reflect management view of current market and economic conditions 
lease accounting 
under the provisions of certain of our leases  there are rent holidays and or escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of rent holidays and escalations are reflected in rent costs on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes cancelable option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we will exercise such option periods due to the fact that we would incur an economic penalty for not doing so 
the lease term commences on the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments which generally coincides with the time when the landlord delivers the property for us to develop and we waive contract contingencies 
all rent costs recognized during construction periods are expensed immediately as pre opening expenses 
judgments made by management for its lease obligations include the probable term for each lease that affects the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holidays and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent  and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
we have not made any changes to the assumptions used to account for leases in the past three years 

table of contents insurance self insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for a portion of losses related to group health insurance  general liability and workers compensation 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
the self insurance liability represents an estimate of the cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial based estimates  as well as incurred but not reported claims  and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
in addition  our history of self insured experience is short and our significant rate of growth could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or should medical costs increase beyond what was expected  our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient  and additional expenses may be recorded 
actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated  resulting in expense reductions 
unanticipated changes in our estimates may produce materially different amounts of expense than that reported historically under these programs 
we have not made any changes to the assumptions used to account our self insurance liabilities in the past three years 
estimating fair value 
the company has a deferred compensation plan  an associated life insurance policy and derivative financial instruments  which are all carried at fair value 
fair value is defined by accounting guidance as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the company approach to estimating fair value may require the company to make significant judgments regarding inputs into the valuation in estimating fair values for derivative financial instruments  the company believes that third party market prices are the best evidence of exit price and where available  bases its estimates on such prices 
all key assumptions and valuations are the responsibility of management 
income taxes 
the determination of the company provision for income taxes requires management judgment in the use of estimates and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
judgment is also required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 
the company establishes contingency reserves for material  known tax exposures relating to deductions  transactions and other matters involving some uncertainty as to the proper tax treatment of the item 
the company reserves reflect its judgment as to the resolution of the issues involved if subject to judicial review 
several years may elapse before a particular matter  for which the company has established a reserve  is audited and finally resolved or clarified 
while the company believes that its reserves are adequate to cover reasonably expected tax risks  issues raised by a tax authority may be finally resolved at an amount different than the related reserve 
such differences could materially increase or decrease the company income tax provision in the current and or future periods 
when facts and circumstances change including a resolution of an issue or statute of limitations expiration  these reserves are adjusted through the provision for income taxes in the period of change 
to the extent the company determines that it will not realize the benefit of some or all of its deferred tax assets  then these assets will be adjusted through the company provision for income taxes in the period in which this determination is made 
unearned revenues 
unearned revenues represent our liability for gift cards that have been sold but not yet redeemed 
we recognize sales when the gift card is redeemed by the customer 
although there are no expiration dates or dormancy fees for our gift cards  based on our historical gift card redemption patterns  we can reasonably estimate the amount of gift cards for which redemption is remote  which is referred to as breakage 
we recognize breakage within other revenue for unused gift card amounts in proportion to actual gift card redemptions  which is also referred to as the redemption recognition method 
the estimated value of gift cards expected to go unused is recognized over the expected period of redemption as the remaining gift card values are redeemed 
utilizing this method  we estimate both the amount of breakage and the time period of redemption 
if 
table of contents actual redemption patterns vary from our estimates  actual gift card breakage income may differ from the amounts recorded 
we update our estimate of our breakage rate periodically and apply that rate to gift card redemptions 
stock based compensation expense 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with fair value recognition provisions  under which we recognize stock based compensation using the black scholes or monte carlo for performance based units option pricing model and recognize expense on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service periods of an option 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of highly subjective and judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we have not made any changes to the assumptions used to account for stock based compensation in the past three years  other than an increase in the forfeiture rate we apply to officer grants  due to the recent officer transitions 
during  the company granted performance based restricted stock units psus to executives and other key employees 
these psus contain a market condition based on total shareholder return and measure the overall stock price performance of the company to the stock price performance of a selected industry peer group 
the actual number of psus subject to the awards will be determined at the end of the performance period based on these performance metrics 
the fair value of the psus is calculated using the monte carlo valuation method 
this method utilizes multiple input variables to determine the probability of the company achieving the market condition and the fair value of the awards 
this method uses judgment and estimation which is the responsibility of management 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases primarily restaurant leases entered into the normal course of business  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued authoritative guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities vie  which was effective beginning fiscal year the new guidance requires a qualitative approach to identifying a controlling financial interest in a vie  and it requires ongoing assessment of whether an entity is a vie and whether an interest in a vie makes the holder the primary beneficiary of the vie 
this new guidance did not have a material effect on the company 
in january  the fasb issued an update regarding guidance over the disclosure requirements of fair value measurements 
this update adds new requirements for disclosure about transfers into and out of levels one and two and also adds additional disclosure requirements about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements relating to level three measurements 
the guidance is effective beginning fiscal year for the disclosure requirements around levels one and two measurements  and is effective beginning fiscal year for the disclosure requirements around level three 
this new guidance currently has no impact on the fair value disclosures of the company  as there have been no transfers out of levels one or two

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk under our credit agreement  amended in june  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings  which bear interest at one of the following rates we select an alternate base rate abr  based on the prime rate plus to  or a libor  based on the relevant one  two  three or six month libor  at our discretion  plus to 
the spread  or margin  for abr and libor loans under the credit agreement is subject to quarterly adjustment based on our then current leverage ratio  as defined by the credit agreement 
as of december   we had million of borrowings subject to variable interest rates  after considering the impact of variable to fixed interest rate swaps 
a plus or minus change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre tax interest expense fluctuation of  on an annualized basis 
our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve this objective  we use an interest rate swap and may use caps to manage our net exposure to interest rate changes related to our borrowings 
as appropriate  on the date derivative contracts are entered into  we designate derivatives as either a hedge of the fair value of a recognized asset or liability or of an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge  or a hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
during march  the company entered into a variable to fixed interest rate swap agreement with suntrust to mitigate our floating interest rate on an aggregate of up to million of our debt that is currently or expected to be outstanding under our amended and restated credit facility 
the interest rate swap has an effective date of march  and a termination date of march  for million of the initial million and march  for the remaining million 
the agreement was designated as a cash flow hedge under which we are required to make payments based on a fixed interest rate of calculated on an initial notional amount of million  in exchange we will receive interest on a million of notional amount at a variable rate 
the variable rate interest we receive is based on the month libor rate 
this hedge is highly effective and there were no gains or losses related to hedge ineffectiveness recognized in earnings during as of december   the million unrealized gain  net of taxes  on the cash flow hedging instrument is reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
refer to note  derivative and other comprehensive income  of notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report 
primarily all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in united states dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to significant foreign currency risk 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality  and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price product purchase commitments which may exclude fuel surcharges and other fees 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
