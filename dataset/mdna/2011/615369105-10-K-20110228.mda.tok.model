the company moody s is a provider of i credit ratings  ii credit and economic related research  data and analytical tools  iii risk management software and iv quantitative credit risk measures  credit portfolio management solutions  training and financial credentialing and certification services 
moody s operates in two reportable segments mis and ma 
mis  the credit rating agency  publishes credit ratings on a wide range of debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide 
revenue is derived from the originators and issuers of such transactions who use mis ratings in the distribution of their debt issues to investors 
the ma segment develops a wide range of products and services that support the risk management activities of institutional participants in global financial markets 
within its rd a business  ma distributes investor oriented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process  including in depth research on major debt issuers  industry studies and commentary on topical credit related events 
the rd a business also produces and provides economic research and credit data and analytical tools such as quantitative credit risk scores 
within its rms business  ma provides both economic and regulatory capital risk management software solutions 
within its professional services business it provides quantitative credit risk measures  credit portfolio management solutions  training and financial credentialing and certification services 
beginning in january  moody s segments were changed to reflect the reorganization announced in august as a result of the reorganization  the rating agency is reported in the mis segment and several ratings business lines were realigned 
all of moody s other non rating commercial activities are represented in the ma segment 
as part of the reorganization there were several realignments within the mis lobs 
sovereign and sub sovereign ratings  which were previously part of financial institutions  infrastructure utilities ratings  which were previously part of corporate finance  and project finance  which was previously part of structured finance  were combined with the public finance business to form a new lob called public  project and infrastructure finance 
in addition  real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business 
furthermore  in august the global managed investments ratings group  previously part of the structured finance business  was combined with the financial institutions business 
in within ma  various aspects of the legacy mis research business and mkmv business were combined to form the subscriptions  software and professional services businesses 
the subscriptions business included credit and economic research  data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis  the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk  securities pricing and valuation software products  and the professional services business included advisory services associated with risk modeling  credit scorecard development  and other specialized analytical projects  as well as credit training and other professional development education services that are typically sold on a per engagement basis 
subscription services are typically sold for an initial month term  with renewal features for subsequent annual periods 
in  the aforementioned ma businesses were realigned and renamed to reflect the reporting unit structure for the ma segment 
pursuant to this realignment the subscriptions business was renamed research data and analytics and the software business was renamed risk management software 
the revised groupings classify certain subscription based risk management software revenue and advisory services relating to software sales to the redefined rms business 
in november  moody s purchased csi  which is currently a reporting unit within ma and for which revenues are reported within the professional services lob 
critical accounting estimates moody s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires moody s to make estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
these estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  moody s k 
table of contents moody s evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable allowances  contingencies  goodwill and intangible assets  restructuring liabilities  pension and other post retirement benefits  utbs and stock based compensation 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following accounting estimates are considered critical because they are particularly dependent on management s judgment about matters that are uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made and changes to those estimates could have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or the services have been provided and accepted by the customer when applicable  fees are determinable and the collection of resulting receivables is considered probable 
in october  the fasb issued asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements asu 
the new standard changes the requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration based on the relative selling price of each deliverable 
the company has elected to early adopt asu on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or materially modified on or after january  if applied in the same manner to the year ended december   asu would not have had a material impact on net revenue reported for both its mis and ma segments in terms of the timing and pattern of revenue recognition 
the adoption of asu did not have a significant effect on the company s net revenue in the period of adoption and is also not expected to have a significant effect on the company s net revenue in periods after the initial adoption when applied to multiple element arrangements based on the currently anticipated business volume and pricing 
for and future periods  pursuant to the guidance of asu  when a sales arrangement contains multiple deliverables  the company allocates revenue to each deliverable based on its relative selling price which is determined based on its vendor specific objective evidence if available  third party evidence if vsoe is not available  or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
the company s products and services will generally continue to qualify as separate units of accounting under asu the company evaluates each deliverable in an arrangement to determine whether it represents a separate unit of accounting 
a deliverable constitutes a separate unit of accounting when it has stand alone value to the customers and if the arrangement includes a customer refund or return right relative to the delivered item  the delivery and performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially in the company s control 
in instances where the aforementioned criteria are not met  the deliverable is combined with the undelivered items and revenue recognition is determined as one single unit 
the company determines whether its selling price in a multi element transaction meets the vsoe criteria by using the price charged for a deliverable when sold separately 
in instances where the company is not able to establish vsoe for all deliverables in a multiple element arrangement  which may be due to the company infrequently selling each element separately  not selling products within a reasonably narrow price range  or only having a limited sales history  the company attempts to establish tpe for deliverables 
the company determines whether tpe exists by evaluating largely similar and interchangeable competitor products or services in standalone sales to similarly situated customers 
however  due to the difficulty in obtaining third party pricing  possible differences in the company s market strategy from that of its peers and the potential that products and services offered by the company may contain a significant level of differentiation and or customization such that the comparable pricing of products with similar functionality cannot be obtained  the company generally is unable to reliably determine tpe 
based on the selling price hierarchy established by asu  when the company is unable to establish selling price using vsoe or tpe  the company will establish an esp 
esp is the price at which the company would transact a sale if the product or service were sold on a stand alone basis 
the company establishes its best estimate of esp considering internal factors relevant to its pricing practices such as costs and margin objectives  standalone sales prices of similar products  percentage of the fee charged for a primary product or service relative to a related product or service  and customer segment and geography 
additional consideration is also given to market conditions such as competitor pricing strategies and market trend 
the company reviews its determination of vsoe  tpe and esp on an annual basis or more frequently as needed 
in the mis segment  revenue attributed to initial ratings of issued securities is recognized when the rating is issued 
revenue attributed to monitoring of issuers or issued securities is recognized ratably over the period in which the monitoring is performed  generally one year 
in the case of commercial mortgage backed securities  derivatives  international residential mortgage backed and asset backed securities  issuers can elect to pay the monitoring fees upfront 
these fees are deferred and recognized over the future monitoring periods based on the expected lives of the rated securities  which ranged from two to years at december  at december   and  deferred revenue related to these securities was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
multiple element revenue arrangements in the mis segment are generally comprised of an initial rating and the related monitoring service 
beginning january   in instances where monitoring fees are not charged for the first year monitoring effort  fees are allo moody s k 
table of contents cated to the initial rating and monitoring services based on the relative selling price of each service to the total arrangement fees 
the company generally uses esp in determining the selling price for its initial ratings as the company rarely sells initial ratings separately without providing related monitoring services and thus is unable to establish vsoe or tpe for initial ratings 
prior to january  and pursuant to the previous accounting standards  for these types of arrangements the initial rating fee was first allocated to the monitoring service determined based on the estimated fair market value of monitoring services  with the residual amount allocated to the initial rating 
under asu this practice can no longer be used for non software deliverables upon the adoption of asu mis estimates revenue for ratings of commercial paper for which  in addition to a fixed annual monitoring fee  issuers are billed quarterly based on amounts outstanding 
revenue is accrued each quarter based on estimated amounts outstanding and is billed when actual data is available 
the estimate is determined based on the issuers most recent reported quarterly data 
at december   and  accounts receivable included approximately million  million and million  respectively  related to accrued commercial paper revenue 
historically  mis has not had material differences between the estimated revenue and the actual billings 
in the ma segment  products and services offered by the company include software licenses and related maintenance  subscriptions  and professional services 
revenue from subscription based products  such as research and data subscriptions and certain software based credit risk management subscription products  is recognized ratably over the related subscription period  which is principally one year 
revenue from sale of perpetual licenses of credit processing software is generally recognized at the time the product master or first copy is delivered or transferred to and accepted by the customer 
software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the annual maintenance period 
revenue from services rendered within the professional services line of business is generally recognized as the services are performed 
if uncertainty exists regarding customer acceptance of the product or service  revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs 
products and services offered within the ma segment are sold either stand alone or together in various combinations 
in instances where a multiple element arrangement includes software and non software deliverables  revenue is allocated to the non software deliverables and to the software deliverables  as a group  using the relative selling prices of each of the deliverables in the arrangement based on the aforementioned selling price hierarchy 
revenue is recognized for each element based upon the conditions for revenue recognition noted above 
if the arrangement contains more than one software deliverable  the arrangement consideration allocated to the software deliverables as a group is allocated to each software deliverable using vsoe 
in the instances where the company is not able to determine vsoe for all of the deliverables of an arrangement  the company allocates the revenue to the undelivered elements equal to its vsoe and the residual revenue to the delivered elements 
if the company is unable to determine vsoe for an undelivered element  the company defers all revenue allocated to the software deliverables until the company has delivered all of the elements or when vsoe has been determined for the undelivered elements 
prior to january  and pursuant to the previous accounting standards  the company allocated revenue in a multiple element arrangement to each deliverable based on its relative fair value  or for software elements  based on vsoe 
if the fair value was not available for an undelivered element  the revenue for the entire arrangement was deferred 
accounts receivable allowance moody s records an allowance for estimated future adjustments to customer billings as a reduction of revenue  based on historical experience and current conditions 
such amounts are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
additionally  estimates of uncollectible accounts are recorded as bad debt expense and are reflected as additions to the accounts receivable allowance 
billing adjustments and uncollectible account write offs are charged against the allowance 
moody s evaluates its accounts receivable allowance by reviewing and assessing historical collection and adjustment experience and the current aging status of customer accounts 
moody s also considers the economic environment of the customers  both from an industry and geographic perspective  in evaluating the need for allowances 
based on its analysis  moody s adjusts its allowance as considered appropriate in the circumstances 
this process involves a high degree of judgment and estimation and could involve significant dollar amounts 
accordingly  moody s results of operations can be affected by adjustments to the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for accounts receivable is adequate to cover anticipated adjustments and write offs under current conditions 
however  significant changes in any of the above factors  or actual write offs or adjustments that differ from the estimated amounts could impact the company s consolidated results of operations 
contingencies accounting for contingencies  including those matters described in the contingencies section of this md a  commencing on page is highly subjective and requires the use of judgments and estimates in assessing their magnitude and likely outcome 
in many cases  the outcomes of such matters will be determined by third parties  including governmental or judicial bodies 
the provisions made in the consolidated financial statements  as well as the related disclosures  represent management s best estimates of the then current status of such matters and their potential outcome based on a review of the facts and in consultation with outside legal counsel where moody s k 
table of contents deemed appropriate 
the company would record a material loss contingency in its financial statements if the loss is both probable of occurring and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the company regularly reviews contingencies and as new information becomes available may  in the future  adjust its associated liabilities 
goodwill and other acquired intangible assets moody s evaluates its goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level  defined as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  annually as of november or more frequently if impairment indicators arise in accordance with asc topic these impairment indicators could include significant events or circumstances that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition or sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit 
at november   the company had five primary reporting units one in mis that encompasses all of moody s ratings operations and four reporting units within ma rd a  rms  training and csi 
the rd a reporting unit encompasses the distribution of investor oriented research and data developed by mis as part of its ratings process  in depth research on major debt issuers  industry studies  economic research and commentary on topical events and credit analytic tools 
the rms reporting unit consists of credit risk management and compliance software that is sold on a license or subscription basis as well as related advisory services for implementation and maintenance 
the training reporting unit consists of the portion of the ma business that offers both credit training as well as other professional development training 
additionally  in november  the company acquired csi  which was tested separately as its own reporting unit for the annual goodwill impairment test as of november  csi is canada s leading provider of financial learning  credentials and certification 
the company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill using a two step impairment test approach at the reporting unit level as required by asc topic  intangibles goodwill and other 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and the company is not required to perform further testing 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  the company must perform a second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined based on the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit and the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is less than the carrying value  the difference is recognized as an impairment charge 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite lived acquired intangible asset involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and appropriate market comparables 
the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable 
however  as these estimates and assumptions are unpredictable and inherently uncertain  actual future results may differ from these estimates 
in addition  the company also makes certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of its reporting units 
goodwill is assigned to a reporting unit at the date when an acquisition is integrated into one of the established reporting units  and is based on which reporting unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition 
other assets and liabilities  including applicable corporate assets  are allocated to the extent they are related to the operation of respective reporting units 
based on the result of the above test  the company does not believe any of its reporting units are at risk of failing step of the impairment test as the fair value for all reporting units is well in excess of the respective reporting unit s carrying value  except for csi as the purchase price represents the fair value of the net assets acquired 
the following table identifies the amount of goodwill allocated to each reporting unit as of december  as well as the amount by which the net assets of each reporting unit would exceed the fair value under step of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic  assuming hypothetical reductions in their fair values as of november  step one sensitivity analysis deficit caused by a hypothetical reduction to fair value goodwill mis rd a rms training csi totals csi was excluded from the sensitivity analysis in the table above as well as the sensitivity analyses on the wacc and future cash flow assumptions discussed below as it was acquired in november accordingly the carrying value of the net assets acquired approximates fair value at november  moody s k 
table of contents the following discussion regarding the company s methodology for determining the fair value of its reporting units excludes the csi which was acquired in november the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology 
the results of the dcf are evaluated against comparable public company and precedent transaction multiples in order to assess the reasonableness of the dcf fair values 
the dcf analysis requires significant judgments regarding the derivation of fair value  including estimation of future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit  which is based on internal budgets and strategic plans  expected long term growth rates  terminal values  weighted average cost of capital and the effects of external factors and market conditions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of the fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit which could result in an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of goodwill  which could be material to the company s financial position and results of operations 
moody s allocates newly acquired goodwill to reporting units based on the reporting unit expected to benefit from the acquisition 
the company evaluates its reporting units on an annual basis  or more frequently if there are changes in the reporting structure of the company due to acquisitions or realignments 
the following discusses the key assumptions utilized in the discounted cash flow valuation methodology which requires significant management judgment wacc the wacc is the rate to discount each reporting unit s estimated future cash flows 
the wacc is calculated based on the proportionate weighting of the cost of debt and equity 
the cost of equity is based on a risk free interest rate  an equity risk factor which is derived from public companies similar to the reporting unit and which captures the perceived risks and uncertainties associated with the reporting unit s cash flows 
the cost of debt component is calculated as the weighted average cost associated with all of the company s outstanding borrowings as of the date of the impairment test and was immaterial to the computation of the wacc 
the cost of debt and equity is weighted based on the debt to market capitalization ratio of publicly traded companies with similarities to the reporting unit being tested 
the wacc for all reporting units ranged from to in differences in the wacc used between reporting units is due primarily to distinct risks and uncertainties regarding the cash flows of the different reporting units 
a sensitivity analysis of the wacc was performed on all reporting units 
an increase in the wacc of one percentage point for each of the reporting units would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value under step one of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic future cash flow assumptions the projections for future cash flows utilized in the models are derived from historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit 
these projections are consistent with the company s operating and strategic plan 
cash flows for each of the next five years beginning in were estimated based on annual revenue growth rates ranging from to 
the growth rates assumed a gradual increase in revenue from financial service customers based on a continued improvement in the global economy and capital markets which began in the second half of beyond five years a terminal value was determined using a perpetuity growth rate based on inflation and real gdp growth rates 
a sensitivity analysis of the growth rates was performed on all reporting units 
a decrease in the growth rates used in the discounted cash flow calculation of for each of the reporting units would not have resulted in the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeding its respective estimated fair value under step one of the goodwill impairment test as prescribed in asc topic amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
there were no such events or changes during that would indicate that the carrying amount of amortizable intangible assets in any of the company s reporting units may not be recoverable 
this determination was made based on improving market conditions which has resulted in higher projected cash flows for all reporting units than was projected in additionally  there were no events or circumstances during that would indicate the need for an adjustment of the remaining useful lives of the company s amortizable intangible assets 
pension and other post retirement benefits the expenses  assets and liabilities that moody s reports for its post retirement plans are dependent on many assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances 
these assumptions include the following future compensation increases  based on the company s long term actual experience and future outlook long term return on pension plan assets  based on historical portfolio results and the expected future average annual return for each major asset class within the plan s portfolio which is principally comprised of equity and fixed income investments future healthcare cost trends  based on historical market data  near term outlooks and assessments of likely long term trends discount rates  based on current yields on high grade corporate long term bonds moody s k 
table of contents the discount rates selected to measure the present value of the company s benefit obligation for its post retirement plans as of december  were derived using a cash flow matching method whereby the company compares each plan s projected payment obligations by year with the corresponding yield on the citibank pension discount curve 
the cash flows by plan are then discounted back to present value to determine the discount rate applicable to each plan 
moody s major assumptions vary by plan and assumptions used are set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in determining these assumptions  the company consults with outside actuaries and other advisors as deemed appropriate 
while the company believes that the assumptions used in its calculations are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could have a significant effect on the expenses  assets and liabilities related to the company s post retirement plans 
when actual plan experience differs from the assumptions used  actuarial gains or losses arise 
excluding differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience on plan assets  the company amortizes  as a component of annual pension expense  total outstanding gains or losses over the estimated average future working lifetime of active plan participants to the extent that the gain loss exceeds of the greater of the beginning of year projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets 
for moody s post retirement plans  the total losses as of december  that have not been recognized in annual expense are million  and moody s expects to recognize net periodic pension expense of million in related to the amortization of actuarial losses 
for moody s funded us pension plan  the differences between the expected long term rate of return assumption and actual experience could also affect the net periodic pension expense 
as permitted under asc topic  the company spreads the impact of asset experience over a five year period for purposes of calculating the market related value of assets that is used in determining the expected return on assets component of annual expense and in calculating the total unrecognized gain or loss subject to amortization 
as of december   the company has an unrecognized asset loss of million  of which million will be recognized in the market related value of assets that is used to calculate the expected return on assets component of expense 
the table below shows the estimated effect that a one percentage point decrease in each of these assumptions will have on moody s operating income 
these effects have been calculated using the company s current projections of expenses  assets and liabilities related to moody s post retirement plans  which could change as updated data becomes available 
assumption used for estimated impact on operating income decrease increase weighted average discount rates weighted average assumed compensation growth rate assumed long term rate of return on pension assets weighted average discount rates of and for pension plans and other post retirement plans  respectively 
a one percentage point increase in assumed healthcare cost trend rates will not affect projected expenses 
based on current projections  the company estimates that expenses related to post retirement plans will be million in compared with million in  excluding the effect of pension settlement charges 
the expected expense increase in reflects the effects of higher benefit obligations primarily due to lower discount rate assumptions and higher amortization of actuarial losses 
stock based compensation the company records compensation expense for all share based payment award transactions granted to employees based on the fair value of the equity instrument at the time of grant 
this includes shares issued under employee stock purchase plans  stock options  restricted stock and stock appreciation rights 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions and estimates that the company believes are reasonable 
some of the assumptions and estimates  such as share price volatility and expected option holding period  are based in part on moody s experience during the period since becoming a public company 
the use of different assumptions and estimates in the black scholes option pricing model could produce materially different estimated fair values for option awards and related expense 
an increase in the following assumptions would have had the following estimated effect on operating income in dollars in millions assumption used for grants increase in assumption estimated impact on operating income in increase decrease average expected dividend yield average expected share price volatility expected option holding period years year moody s k 
table of contents income taxes the company is subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions 
the company s tax assets and liabilities are affected by the amounts charged for service provided and expenses incurred as well as other tax matters such as intercompany transactions 
the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with asc topic therefore  income tax expense is based on reported income before income taxes  and deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between the amounts of assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for income tax purposes 
moody s is subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions which involve legacy tax and other tax matters 
the company regularly assesses the likely outcomes of such audits in order to determine the appropriateness of liabilities for utps 
the company classifies interest related to income taxes as a component of interest expense in the company s consolidated financial statements and associated penalties  if any  as part of other non operating expenses 
for utps  asc topic requires a company to first determine whether it is more likely than not defined as a likelihood of more than fifty percent that a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits as of the reporting date  assuming that taxing authorities will examine the position and have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a tax position that meets this more likely than not threshold is then measured and recognized at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely to be realized upon effective settlement with a taxing authority 
as the determination of liabilities related to utps and associated interest and penalties requires significant estimates to be made by the company  there can be no assurance that the company will accurately predict the outcomes of these audits  and thus the eventual outcomes could have a material impact on the company s operating results or financial condition 
for certain of its foreign subsidiaries  the company has deemed a portion of the undistributed earnings relating to these subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested within its foreign operations 
accordingly  the company has not provided deferred income taxes on these indefinitely reinvested earnings 
a future distribution or change in assertion regarding reinvestment by the foreign subsidiaries relating to these earnings could result in additional tax liability for the company 
it is not practicable to determine the amount of the potential additional tax liability due to complexities in the tax laws and in the hypothetical calculations that would have to be made 
other estimates in addition  there are other accounting estimates within moody s consolidated financial statements  including recoverability of deferred tax assets  anticipated dividend distributions from non us subsidiaries and valuation of investments in affiliates 
management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in moody s consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on moody s consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact moody s 
operating segments beginning in january  moody s segments were changed to reflect the reorganization announced in august as a result of the reorganization  the rating agency is reported in the mis segment and several ratings business lines have been realigned 
all of moody s other non rating commercial activities are represented in the ma segment 
as part of the reorganization there were several realignments within the mis lobs 
sovereign and sub sovereign ratings  which were previously part of financial institutions  infrastructure utilities ratings  which were previously part of corporate finance  and project finance  which was previously part of structured finance  were combined with the public finance business to form a new lob called public  project and infrastructure finance 
in addition  real estate investment trust ratings were moved from financial institutions and corporate finance to the structured finance business 
furthermore  in august the global managed investments ratings group  previously part of the structured finance business  was combined with the financial institutions business 
the mis segment now consists of four lines of business corporate finance  structured finance  financial institutions and public  project and infrastructure finance that generate revenue principally from fees for the assignment and ongoing monitoring of credit ratings on debt obligations and the entities that issue such obligations in markets worldwide 
as part of the reorganization  various aspects of the legacy mis research business and mkmv business were combined to form the subscriptions  software and professional services businesses within ma 
the subscriptions business included credit and economic research  data and analytical models that are sold on a subscription basis for an initial month term  with renewal features for subsequent annual periods  the software business included license and maintenance fees for credit risk  securities pricing and valuation moody s k

the growth in ratings revenue is primarily due to strong issuance activity in within the corporate finance  financial institution and public finance debt markets 
the growth in ma is due to higher revenue across all lobs 
transaction revenue accounted for of global mco revenue in compared to in the same period of the prior year 
transaction revenue in the mis segment represents the initial rating of a new debt issuance as well as other one time fees while relationship revenue represents the recurring monitoring of a rated debt obligation and or entities that issue such obligations  as well as revenue from programs such as commercial paper  medium term notes and shelf registrations 
in the ma segment  relationship revenue represents subscription based revenues and software maintenance revenue 
transaction revenue in ma represents software license fees and revenue from the professional services line of business which offers credit risk management advisory and training services  which are typically sold on a per engagement basis 
us revenue increased million over reflecting growth in all ratings lobs  most notably in rated issuance volumes for bank loans and speculative grade corporate bonds 
there was also good growth over the prior year in us public finance and cref rated issuance 
additionally  there was growth in all lobs within the ma segment  most notably in rms 
international revenue increased million compared to the same period in primarily reflecting growth in cfg revenue  particularly in speculative grade ratings in emea  coupled with higher banking related revenue across all regions 
additionally  the growth moody s k

for claims  litigation and proceedings not related to income taxes  where it is both probable that a liability is expected to be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated  the company records liabilities in the consolidated financial statements and periodically adjusts these as appropriate 
in other instances  because of uncertainties related to the probable outcome and or the amount or range of loss  management does not record a liability but discloses the contingency if significant

in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of litigation  regulatory  enforcement and similar matters and contingencies  particularly where the claimants seek large or indeterminate damages or where the parties assert novel legal theories or the matters involve a large number of parties  the company cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be or the timing of any resolution of such matters

in  as part of this matter and due to a statue of limitations expiration  moody s recorded a reduction of accrued interest expense of million million  net of tax and an increase in other non operating income of million relating to amounts due to new d b 
in  settlement agreements were executed with the irs with respect to certain legacy tax matters related to the years and with respect to these settlements  moody s and new d b believed that ims health and nmr did not pay their full share of the liability to the irs under the terms of the applicable separation agreements between the parties 
moody s and new d b subsequently paid these amounts to the irs and commenced arbitration proceedings against ims health and nmr to resolve this dispute 
this resulted in settlement payments to moody s of million in million as a reduction of interest expense and million as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expense and million million as a reduction of interest expense and million as a reduction of tax expense in the aforementioned settlement payments resulted in net income benefits of million and million in and  respectively

in  new d b and moody s each deposited million with the irs in order to stop the accrual of statutory interest on potential tax deficiencies with respect to the through tax years 
in  new d b and moody s requested a return of that deposit 
the irs applied a portion of our deposit in satisfaction of an assessed deficiency and returned the balance to the company
