item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and applicable notes to our consolidated financial statements and other information included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including risk factors disclosed in part i  item ia 
the following information contains forward looking statements  which are subject to risks and uncertainties 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  our actual results may differ from those expressed or implied by the forward looking statements 
see forward looking statements at the beginning of this annual report on form k 
our first generation satellites have experienced various anomalies over time  including degradation in the performance of the solid state power amplifiers which adversely affects the ability of these satellites to provide two way  or duplex  communications services 
accordingly  our operations and liquidity have been adversely affected 
we have initiated plans to improve our operations and liquidity as discussed further below and in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we believe we have sufficient liquidity to fund our current operations for at least the next months 
however  the successful execution of our plans is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that any portion of our plans will be achieved 
if we fail to obtain the necessary additional financing in a timely manner  the procurement and deployment of our additional second generation satellites  ground upgrades  and ongoing operations will be materially adversely impacted 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to our consolidated financial statements contains a description of the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  property and equipment  inventory  derivative instruments  litigation  claims and contingencies  allowance for doubtful accounts  pension plan  stock based compensation  goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we define a critical accounting policy or estimate as one that is both important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
we believe that the following are the critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimates but are not deemed critical as defined in this paragraph 
revenue recognition our primary types of revenue include i service revenue from two way voice communication and data transmissions and one way data transmissions between a mobile or fixed device and ii subscriber equipment revenue from the sale of duplex two way transmission products  spot consumer retail products  and simplex one way transmission products 
additionally  we generate revenue by providing engineering and support services to certain customers 
we provide duplex  spot and simplex services directly to customers and through resellers and independent gateway operators 
duplex for our duplex customers and resellers  we recognize revenue for monthly access fees in the period services are rendered 
access fees represent the minimum monthly charge for each line of service based on its associated rate plan 
we also recognize revenue for airtime minutes in excess of the monthly access fees in the period such minutes are used 
under certain annual plans where customers prepay for a predetermined amount of minutes  we defer revenue until the minutes are used or the prepaid time period expires 
unused minutes accumulate until they expire  usually one year after activation  at which point revenue is recognized for any remaining unused minutes 
for annual access fees charged for certain annual plans  revenue is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the plan 
credits granted to customers are expensed or charged against deferred revenue upon issuance 
certain subscriber acquisition costs  including such items as dealer commissions  internal sales commissions and equipment subsidies  are expensed at the time of the related sale 
royalty payments are deferred and recognized as expense over the contract term 
spot and simplex we sell spot and simplex services as annual plans and defer and recognize revenue ratably over the service term  beginning when the service is activated by the customer 
igo we earn a portion of our revenues through the sale of airtime minutes on a wholesale basis to independent gateway operators 
we recognize revenue from services provided to independent gateway operators based upon airtime minutes used by their customers and contractual fee arrangements 
if collection is uncertain  we recognize revenue when cash payment is received 
equipment subscriber equipment revenue represents the sale of fixed and mobile user terminals  accessories and our spot and simplex products 
we recognize revenue upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection is probable 
other we also provide certain engineering services to assist customers in developing new technologies related to our system 
we recognize the revenues associated with these services when the services are rendered  and we recognize the expenses when incurred 
we recognize revenues and costs associated with long term engineering contracts on the percentage of completion basis of accounting 
property and equipment costs associated with the design  manufacture  test and launch of our low earth orbit satellites are capitalized 
capitalized costs associated with our satellites are tracked by fixed asset category and are allocated to each asset as it comes into service 
for assets that are sold or retired  including satellites that are de orbited and no longer providing services  we remove the estimated applicable cost and accumulated depreciation 
we recognize a loss from an in orbit failure of a satellite as an expense in the period it is determined that the satellite is not recoverable 
as our second generation satellites are incorporated into the second generation constellation  we will begin depreciating the satellites on the date each satellite is placed into service the in service date over their estimated lives 
we evaluate the appropriateness of estimated useful lives assigned to our property and equipment and revise such lives to the extent warranted by changing facts and circumstances 
we review the carrying value of our assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the recorded value may not be recoverable 
we look to current and future undiscounted cash flows  excluding financing costs  as primary indicators of recoverability 
if we determine that an impairment exists  we calculate any related impairment loss based on fair value 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method takes into account the differences between financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
our deferred tax calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition or the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities  could affect these estimates 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that the rate is enacted 
we are required to assess whether it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize some or all of our deferred tax assets 
if we cannot determine that deferred tax assets are more likely than not recoverable  we are required to provide a valuation allowance against those assets 
this assessment takes into account factors including a the nature  frequency  and severity of current and cumulative financial reporting losses  b sources of estimated future taxable income  and c tax planning strategies 
derivative instruments we recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
recognized gains or losses on derivative instruments are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we estimate the fair values of our derivative financial instruments using various techniques that are considered to be consistent with the objective of measuring fair values 
in selecting the appropriate technique  we consider  among other factors  the nature of the instrument  the market risks that embodies it and the expected means of settlement 
the fair value of our interest rate cap is determined using pricing models developed based on the libor rate and other observable market data 
that value is adjusted to reflect nonperformance risk of both the counterparty and the company 
for our warrants issued in conjunction with the availability fee for the contingent equity agreement we use the black sholes pricing model to determine fair value 
for the conversion rights and features embedded within the notes and the warrants issued with the notes we use the monte carlo valuation technique to determine fair value 
valuations derived from these models are subject to ongoing internal and external verification and review 
estimating fair values of derivative financial instruments requires the development of significant and subjective estimates that may  and are likely to  change over the duration of the instrument with related changes in internal and external market factors 
our financial position and results of operations may vary materially from quarter to quarter based on conditions other than our operating revenues and expenses 
inventory inventory consists of purchased products  including fixed and mobile user terminals and accessories 
we state inventory transactions at the lower of cost or market 
at the end of each quarter  we review product sales and returns from the previous twelve months and write off any excess and obsolete inventory 
we compute cost using the first in  first out fifo method 
we record inventory allowances for inventories with a lower market value or that are slow moving in the period of determination 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of some of our customers to make required payments 
we review these estimated allowances on a case by case basis  analyzing the customer payment history and information regarding the customer creditworthiness known to us 
in addition  we record a reserve based on the size and age of all receivable balances against those balances that do not have specific reserves 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in their inability to make payments  we would record additional allowances 
pension plan our pension benefit obligation and expense is calculated using actuarial models 
critical assumptions and estimates used in the actuarial calculations include discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets and other participant data  such as demographic factors  mortality  and termination discount rates are determined annually and are based on our calculated average of rates of return of long term corporate bonds 
discount rates were based on moody s and citigroup s annualized yield curve index as of december  and the discount rate used at the measurement date decreased to in from in a basis point increase in our discount rate would reduce our benefit obligation by million 
expected long term rates of return on plan assets are determined and are based on an evaluation of our plan assets  historical trends and experience  taking into account current and expected market conditions 
plan assets are comprised primarily of equity and debt securities 
the rate of return on plan assets has remained consistent at from to to determine the rates of return  we consider historical experience and expected future performance of plan assets 
stock based compensation to measure compensation expense  we use valuation models which require estimates such as  forfeitures  vesting terms calculated based on market conditions associated with a certain award  volatility  and risk free interest rates 
additionally  we recognize stock based compensation expense over the requisite service periods of the awards on a straight line basis  which is generally commensurate with the vesting term 
goodwill and intangible assets we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time if events occur or circumstances indicate that the current carrying amount of goodwill may not be recoverable 
our annual testing of goodwill is based on comparing the carrying value of our reporting unit to our estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit at december we estimate the fair value of the company using a market approach and discounted cash flow valuation technique and compare this estimate to the carrying value of the company 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations 
we also perform an analysis on our intangible assets to test for impairment whenever events occur that indicate an impairment could exist 
litigation  commitments and contingencies we are subject to various claims and lawsuits that arise in the ordinary course of business 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires judgment and assessment based on professional knowledge and experience of our management and legal counsel 
the ultimate resolution of any such exposure may vary from earlier estimates as further facts and circumstances become known 
performance indicators our management reviews and analyzes several key performance indicators in order to manage our business and assess the quality of and potential variability of our earnings and cash flows 
these key performance indicators include total revenue  which is an indicator of our overall business growth  subscriber growth and churn rate  which are both indicators of the satisfaction of our customers  average monthly revenue per unit  or arpu  which is an indicator of our pricing and ability to obtain effectively long term  high value customers 
we calculate arpu separately for each of our duplex  simplex  spot  and igo businesses  operating income and ebitda  which is an indication of our financial performance  capital expenditures  which are an indicator of future revenue growth potential and cash requirements 
comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue total revenue increased by million  or approximately  to million for from million in we attribute this increase to higher service and equipment revenues as a result of gains in our spot and simplex subscriber base 
the increase in our spot and simplex sales was partially offset by decreases in service revenue and equipment sales in our duplex business  which continues to be affected by our two way communication issues 
the following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue by type of service for and in thousands 
year ended december  year ended december  revenue of total revenue revenue of total revenue service revenue duplex spot simplex igo other total the following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue for equipment sales for and in thousands

year ended december  average number of subscribers for the period duplex spot simplex igo arpu monthly duplex spot simplex igo december  ending number of subscribers duplex spot simplex igo other total service revenue duplex revenue decreased approximately in from our two way communication issues continue to affect adversely our duplex revenue 
despite our efforts to maintain our duplex subscriber base by lowering prices for our duplex products  our subscriber base decreased by approximately during our arpu for duplex in decreased by approximately to from in as we launch and place into service our second generation satellites in  our two way communication reliability will improve  and we expect duplex service revenue to increase in spot revenue increased approximately in from we generated increased revenue from our spot satellite gps messenger and other spot consumer retail services during the year primarily as a result of the release of spot our spot subscriber base increased by approximately during our arpu for spot in decreased by to from in simplex revenue increased approximately in from our simplex subscribers increased during our arpu for simplex in increased by to from in these increases relate primarily to the axonn acquisition in  which had a full year of impact in subscriber equipment sales duplex equipment sales decreased by approximately  in from this decrease in equipment sales relates primarily to our two way communication issues 
spot equipment sales increased approximately in from this increase relates to our sales of our spot satellite gps messenger and spot communicator products during the year 
simplex equipment sales increased approximately in from this increase in sales of our one way transmission products relates primarily to our axonn acquisition in december this acquisition resulted in new sales of data machine to machine mm products  including stx  mmt  and smartone asset tracking solutions 
other equipment sales decreased approximately in from this decrease relates primarily to revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting for the sale and construction of gateway assets in operating expenses total operating expenses increased million  or approximately  to million for from million in the increase is primarily due to increases in cost of subscriber equipment sales  asset impairment  and depreciation  amortization and accretion expense 
these increases were offset by decreases in our cost of services and marketing  general and administrative expenses 
cost of services cost of services decreased million  or approximately  to million for from million in cost of services is comprised primarily of network operating costs  which are generally fixed in nature 
the decrease during the year was primarily related to reductions in stock based compensation due to forfeitures 
other decreases were related to outsourced technical support for our gateways during which did not occur in and reductions in research and development expense during the year 
these decreases were offset by increases in costs incurred primarily related to the development of new products 
cost of subscriber equipment sales cost of subscriber equipment sales increased million  or approximately  to million for from million in increases during the year were due to increased equipment revenue  as well as  increased expediting fees paid to suppliers to accelerate the delivery of products experiencing extended lead time and increases related to acquisition adjustments for some of our simplex products 
these increases were offset by increased margins on spot units related to the axonn acquisition in reduction in the value of equipment reduction in the value of equipment increased million to million for from million in the increase was related to an impairment charge of million recorded to adjust the cost of certain products that require the use of our two way communication services 
impairment charges on inventory represents write downs of our second generation phones and related accessory inventory 
these charges were recognized after assessment of our inventory quantities and our forecasted equipment sales and prices given the current and expected market conditions for this type of equipment 
marketing  general and administrative marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or approximately  to million for from million in this decrease was primarily related to reductions in stock based compensation due to forfeitures 
other decreases were related to lower marketing and advertising costs as well as lower legal fees incurred during the year 
reduction in the value of assets reduction in the value of assets increased million  or  during from we recognized an impairment charge to goodwill of million based on our annual impairment analysis 
additional reductions in the value of assets were related to gateway spare parts of million and other spare parts of million 
depreciation  amortization and accretion depreciation  amortization  and accretion expense increased million  or approximately  to million for from million in the increase relates primarily to the increase in depreciation expense due to the reduction in the useful lives of our eight spare satellites from years to years based on changes in the probability of functionality of duplex services 
additional increases were due to the amortization of the intangible assets acquired from axonn in december and the related accretion expense of the fair value of contingent consideration 
depreciation expenses also increased due to one of our second generation satellites coming into service during november other income expense interest expense interest expense decreased by million to million for from million in this decrease is due to conversion of notes to common stock in prior periods  which resulted in a write off of a portion of the deferred financing costs at the time of conversion 
this resulted in less amortization in the current period 
derivative loss derivative loss increased by million to million for compared to these losses are due to the fair value adjustment to our derivative assets and liabilities 
the increase was primarily due to increases in our stock price over the year 
other other income expense decreased by million to million of expense for from million of income in this decrease is primarily due to impairment of our investment in open range communications of million  and losses on our equity method investments during comparison of the results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue total revenue decreased by million  or approximately  to million for from million in we attribute this decrease primarily to lower service revenue which we believe stems from lower price service plans introduced in order to maintain our subscriber base despite our two way communication issues and from reductions in sales of our duplex equipment 
our arpu for duplex in decreased by to from in our arpu for spot in increased by to from in the following table sets forth amounts and percentages of our revenue by type of service for and in thousands

year ended december  average number of subscribers for the period duplex simplex spot igo arpu monthly duplex simplex spot igo december  ending number of subscribers duplex simplex spot igo other total service revenue service revenue decreased million  or approximately  to million for  from million for although our subscriber base grew during to approximately  we experienced decreased duplex arpu resulting in lower service revenue 
the primary reason for this decrease in our service revenue was the reduction of our prices in response to our two way communication issues 
subscriber equipment sales subscriber equipment sales decreased million  or approximately  to million for  from million for we attribute this decrease to reduced sales of our duplex products to our two way communication issues 
operating expenses total operating expenses decreased million  or approximately  to million for  from million for this decrease was due primarily to lower marketing  general and administrative costs due in part to our reductions in headcount  lower cost of goods sold as a result of lower equipment sales related to our duplex products and reduced depreciation and amortization costs 
cost of services our cost of services for and were million and million  respectively 
our cost of services is comprised primarily of network operating costs  which are generally fixed in nature 
the decrease in the cost of services during is due primarily to lower contract labor and other operating expenses partially offset by higher research and development expenses related to our next generation ground component development 
cost of subscriber equipment sales cost of subscriber equipment sales decreased approximately million  or approximately  to million for  from million for this decrease was due primarily to lower sales of our duplex products due to our two way communication issues 
marketing  general and administrative marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or approximately  to million for  from million for this decrease was due primarily to lower marketing and advertising costs  reduced stock based compensation costs and lower commissions related to the reduced revenue 
depreciation  amortization and accretion depreciation and amortization expense decreased approximately million  or  to million for  from million for this decrease was due primarily to the first generation satellite constellation reaching fully depreciated status at december  other income expense other income increased by million for as compared to this change resulted primarily from an expense in due to unfavorable exchange rate on the euro denominated escrow account for our second generation satellites procurement contract resulting from the appreciation of the u 
s dollar in the gain in was due primarily to the favorable change in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar 
interest expense interest income decreased by million to million for  from million for this decrease was due to lower average cash balances on hand and lower interest rates as compared to the prior year 
derivative loss for  derivative loss was million compared to million in this increased loss resulted from fair value adjustments related to the derivatives from our notes  the adjustment of the exercise price of our warrants associated with our notes  which resulted in the number of shares of common stock subject to the warrants increasing by million due to the issuance of stock as part of our acquisition of the assets of axonn  and a decrease in the fair value of our interest rate cap agreement as a result of a decrease in market interest rates 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are the remaining funds available under our facility agreement  cash on hand  cash flows from operations  if any  and our contingent equity account 
our principal liquidity requirements are to meet capital expenditure needs  including procuring and deploying our second generation constellation  operating costs  working capital  and research and development 
we may direct the transfer of funds from our contingent equity account to operating accounts only if no default has occurred and is continuing under our facility agreement  however  the administrative agent of the facility agreement may  but is not obligated to  transfer contingent equity funds to our operating accounts in a default situation 
cash flows for the years ended december    and the following table shows our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities for   and in thousands statements of cash flows year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  net cash used by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash from financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash flows used by operating activities net cash used by operating activities during was million compared to million in this increase in cash used was primarily the result of unfavorable changes in operating assets and liabilities during the year ended december   as compared to the same period in we continued to use cash to fund cash operating losses operating losses after adjustments for non cash expenses including depreciation  amortization  accretion  stock based compensation  impairment of assets  and changes in the fair values of derivative assets and liabilities 
net cash used in operating activities during decreased to a cash outflow of million from an outflow of million for this decrease was due primarily to cost savings efforts in our general and administrative areas and reduced inventory purchases 
cash flows used in investing activities cash used in investing activities was million during compared to million during this decrease in cash used during when compared to was primarily the result of decreased payments related to the construction of our second generation constellation during as the second generation satellites neared completion 
we will continue to incur significant capital expenditures to complete the construction and launch of our second generation satellite constellation and upgrade our gateways and other ground facilities 
we have entered into various agreements to design  construct  and launch our satellites in the normal course of business 
these capital expenditures will support our growth and the resiliency of our operations and will also support the delivery of new revenue streams 
cash used in investing activities was million for  compared to million in this increase was primarily the result of increased payments related to the construction of our second generation satellites 
cash flows provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to million during from million in the decrease was due primarily to lower funding needs related to the construction of our second generation satellites and related ground facilities 
we funded these activities by borrowing under our facility agreement 
we spent approximately million on these projects in compared to approximately million during we also made million non recurring debt financing payments in compared to million during net cash provided by financing activities increased by million to million in from million in this is a direct result of our increased borrowings  primarily from our facility agreement and notes  in capital expenditures first second generation satellites and satellite operations control centers we have entered into various agreements related to procuring and deploying the first satellites of our second generation constellation and upgrading our satellite operations control centers 
the contracts related to these capital expenditures are further discussed in our contractual obligations and commitments section below 
we have used portions of the proceeds from sales of common stock to thermo  the proceeds from our initial public offering  the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and notes and borrowings under our credit facility with thermo and the facility agreement to fund expenditures incurred through we plan to fund the balance of the capital expenditures for the first second generation satellites and the satellite operations control centers upgrades through the use of the remaining funds available under our facility agreement  cash on hand  cash flows from operations if any  our contingent equity agreement and other financing including additonal equity or debt on terms not yet arranged 
we may direct the transfer of funds from our contingent equity account to operating accounts only if no default has occurred and is continuing under our facility agreement  however  the administrative agent of the facility agreement may  but is not obligated to  transfer contingent equity funds to our operating accounts in a default situation 
the amount of capital expenditures incurred as of december  and estimated future capital expenditures related to the construction of the first satellites of our second generation constellation  satellite operations control centers and the launch services contract is presented in the table below in millions  based on when cash payment is scheduled to be made  excluding capitalized interest payments through december  estimated future payments capital expenditures thereafter total thales alenia second generation satellites thales alenia satellite operations control centers arianespace launch services launch insurance other capital expenditures and capitalized labor total as of december   million of the above capital expenditures were recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
next generation gateways and other ground facilities we have also entered into various agreements related to upgrading our gateways and other ground facilities 
the contracts related to these capital expenditures are discussed further in our contractual obligations and commitments section below 
we have used portions of the proceeds from sales of common stock to thermo  the proceeds from our initial public offering  the net proceeds from the sale of the notes and notes and borrowings under our credit facility with thermo and the facility agreement to fund expenditures incurred through we plan to fund the balance of the capital expenditures for upgrading our gateways and other ground facilities through cash flows from operations  our contingent equity agreement and proceeds from additional debt and equity financings not yet arranged 
if we do not obtain such funds from cash flows from operations and from the proceeds of future debt and equity financings over the next months  our ability to continue to procure the upgrade of our gateways and other ground facilities will be impaired 
if future cash flows from operations are below our expectations or the costs of procurement are higher than expected  we will require even more external funding than planned 
our ability to obtain additional funding may be adversely impacted by a number of factors  including the global economic situation and credit markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such additional liquidity on reasonable terms  or at all 
we have not yet entered into any debt or equity financing arrangements 
if we are not able to secure such funding  we would need to delay some or all of the procurement or terminate the existing contractual obligations 
if we were to terminate our existing contractual obligations  there is a possibility that the costs incurred to date may not be recoverable and additional termination costs may be required 
the amount of actual and contractual capital expenditures related to the construction of the ground component and related costs  is presented in the table below in millions  based on when cash payment is scheduled to be made  excluding capitalized interest payments through december  estimated future payments capital expenditures thereafter total hughes second generation ground component including research and development expense oceus networks ground network total on march   we entered into an agreement with hughes which extended to july  or earlier if the company obtains additional financing the deadline for us to make all scheduled payments previously due prior to july  the deferred payments will incur interest at the rate of per annum 
if we do not make these required payments by july   we may terminate the contract for convenience 
if the contract is terminated for convenience  then we must make a final payment of million in either cash or globalstar common stock at our election 
if we elect to make payment in globalstar common stock  hughes will have the option either to accept the common stock or instruct us to complete a block sale of globalstar common stock and deliver the proceeds to hughes 
on march   we entered into an agreement with oceus which extended to february  or earlier if the company obtains additional financing the deadline for us to make scheduled milestone payments which were previously due at various times during the milestones that have been or are expected to be completed and invoiced in  which may be deferred to february   totaled million 
the deferred payments will incur interest at a rate of per annum 
as of december   million of the above capital expenditures were recorded in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
the above table does not include other possible capital expenditures or capitalized labor 
second second generation satellites while we have a contract with thales to construct an additional satellites  including one prototype satellite already constructed  we are currently negotiating with thales to amend the current contract and define a new quantity of satellites with associated terms and conditions  including adjustments to price and schedule 
thales has already completed the procurement of certain long lead time components and parts for six of these satellites and is currently holding these components and parts in storage 
the amount of actual and contractual capital expenditures in the original contract related to the construction of the second satellites of our second generation constellation is million 
these contractual capital expenditures do not include launch services  launch insurance  and other capital expenditures and capitalized labor which has not been finalized at this time 
if we do not obtain funds from cash flows from operations and future debt and equity financings  our ability to procure the second satellites of our second generation constellation will be impaired 
if future cash flows from operations are below our expectations or the costs of procurement is higher than expected  we will require even more external funding than planned 
our ability to obtain additional funding may be adversely impacted by a number of factors  including the global economic situation and related credit markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such additional liquidity on reasonable terms  or at all 
we have not yet entered into any debt or equity financing arrangements 
if we are not able to secure such funding  we would need to delay some or all of the procurement or terminate the existing contractual obligations

facility agreement on june   we entered into a million senior secured facility agreement the facility agreement with a syndicate of bank lenders  including bnp paribas  natixis  soci t g n rale  caylon  cr dit industriel et commercial as arrangers and bnp paribas as the security agent and coface agent 
ninety five percent of our obligations under the agreement are guaranteed by coface  the french export credit agency 
the initial funding process of the coface facility agreement began on june  and was completed on july  at the time of closing  the new facility was comprised of a million tranche for future payments to and to reimburse us for amounts we previously paid to thales alenia space for construction of our second generation satellites 
such reimbursed amounts were used by us a to make payments to arianespace for launch services  hughes networks systems llc for ground network equipment  software and satellite interface chips and oceus networks formally known as ericsson federal inc for ground system upgrades  b to provide up to million for our working capital and general corporate purposes and c to pay a portion of the insurance premium to coface  and a million tranche that will be used to make payments to arianespace for launch services and to pay a portion of the insurance premium to coface 
the facility will mature months after the first repayment date 
the facility bears interest at a floating libor rate  capped at  plus through december  increasing to through december and thereafter 
interest payments are due on a semi annual basis 
on december   we entered into an amendment with the lenders and agent party thereto primarily due to the effects on thales from an earthquake at one of their facilities 
the amendment delays the first semi annual principal repayment date by up to six months to the earlier of eight months after the launch of the th second generation satellite or june   delays the final maturity date by the amount of the delay of the first principal repayment date  reduces the minimum adjusted consolidated ebitda covenant requirements for all relevant periods from the period ending december  through the period ending june   delays the effective date of the minimum debt service coverage ratio by six months to the period commencing on july  and ending december  if no principal payment is required to be made in  delays the last date for required in orbit acceptance of second generation satellites by nine months to september   and requires in orbit acceptance of second generation satellites by january  the amended facility agreement  requires that we not permit our capital expenditures other than those funded with cash proceeds from insurance and condemnation events  equity issuances or the issuance of our stock to acquire certain assets to exceed million in and million in with unused amounts permitted to be carried over to subsequent years following the contingent equity release date  we maintain a minimum liquidity of million  we achieve for each period the following minimum adjusted consolidated ebitda as defined in the facility agreement period minimum amount million million million million million million million beginning with the period of july  through december   we maintain a minimum debt service coverage ratio of  gradually increasing to a ratio of through  and beginning in  we maintain a maximum net debt to adjusted consolidated ebitda ratio of  gradually decreasing to through our obligations under the facility are guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all of our domestic subsidiaries and are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets and those of our domestic subsidiaries other than fcc licenses  including patents and trademarks  of the equity of our domestic subsidiaries and of the equity of certain foreign subsidiaries 
amounts repaid may not be reborrowed 
we must repay the loans a in full upon a change in control or b partially i if there are excess cash flows on certain dates  ii upon certain insurance and condemnation events and iii upon certain asset dispositions 
in addition to the financial covenants described above  the facility agreement places limitations on our ability and our subsidiaries to incur debt  create liens  dispose of assets  carry out mergers and acquisitions  make loans  investments  distributions or other transfers and capital expenditures or enter into certain transactions with affiliates 
by letter dated september   the coface agent notified us that we had failed to deliver to the coface agent a certified copy of the relevant license not later than twenty five business days prior to the first launch of the satellites  constituting a breach that had triggered a default 
as such  the coface agent instituted a draw stop  prohibiting us from utilizing the facility agreement until the default had been remediated or waived  but did not take any action to accelerate the debt 
the coface agent provided a remedy period to cure the breach by september  on october   we entered into an amendment and cancelation agreement with the coface bank syndicate  which canceled the original notification of default entirely and amended the facility agreement so that we are required to provide a satellite communication license issued by french regulatory authorities no later than november   and a satellite communication license issued by us regulatory authorities no later than february  under the amendment  we were prohibited from borrowing under the facility agreement until we provided the required license issued by the french regulatory authorities  and once that was provided  we could resume borrowing while pursuing the license from the us authorities 
the amendment also includes a provision that we and the coface bank syndicate agent agree that failing to provide either of the licenses would constitute an event of default 
by order dated october   the french ministry for the economy  industry and employment authorized globalstar europe sarl  a wholly owned subsidiary of globalstar  inc  to operate our second generation satellite constellation 
on november   the french postal and electronic communications regulatory authority granted a license to globalstar europe sarl  to use certain frequency bands to provide mobile satellite service from mhz and mhz 
this ended the prohibition on our borrowings under the facility agreement 
on march   we entered into amendment letter no 
to the facility agreement  which waived the obligation of us to deliver to the coface agent a satellite communication license issued by us regulatory authorities no later than february  under the amendment  we were required to deliver to the coface agent a special temporary authority sta granted by the fcc by no later than march   which licenses us to commercially operate our ground stations in connection with our existing and future satellites in the us for a period of no less than days 
we were required to provide a satellite communication license issued by us regulatory authorities in any event not later than the earlier of september  or the expiration of the sta 
on march   we entered into amendment no 
to the facility agreement  which removed the u 
s license requirement of amendments no 
and no 
and required that the conditional permanent us license received by us on march  be in full force not later than august   which requires the registration of our second generation satellites by france under the outer space treaty and the un convention on registration of objects launched into outer space 
the amendment also included a provision that failing to provide the permanent license would constitute an event of default 
we believe that we will be able to provide the required permanent us license within the designated period although we cannot assure you that this will be achieved 
short term liquidity needs at january   our principal short term liquidity needs were to make payments to complete the procurement of our first second generation satellites and upgrading our satellite operations control centers  to make payments related to our three remaining launches for the first second generation satellites the remaining satellites  to make payments related to the construction of our control network facility and second generation ground component  to fund our commited working capital  to fund future operations  and to make payments to procure and deploy our second second generation satellites and to upgrade our gateways and other ground facilities 
we plan to fund our short term liquidity requirements from the following sources cash on hand at december  million  cash from our facility agreement million was available at december   additional debt and equity offerings not yet arranged  cash available under our contingent equity account million was available at december   and operating cash flows if any 
long term liquidity needs our principal long term liquidity needs are to make payments to procure and deploy our second second generation satellites and upgrading our gateways and other ground facilities  to fund our working capital and operations  including any growth in our business  and to fund repayment of our indebtedness  both principal and interest  when due 
sources of long term liquidity may include  if necessary  the exercise of warrants and additional debt and equity financings which have not yet been arranged 
we cannot assume that sufficient additional financing will be obtained on acceptable terms  if at all 
we also expect cash flow from operations to be a source of long term liquidity once we have deployed our second generation satellite constellation 
contractual obligations and commitments at december   we have a remaining commitment to purchase a total of million of mobile phones  services and other equipment under various commercial agreements with qualcomm 
effective february   we amended our agreement with qualcomm to extend the term and defer delivery of mobile phones and related equipment until june through february we expect to negotiate the termination of this contract in in june  we and thales alenia space entered into an amended and restated contract for the construction of second generation low earth orbit satellites to incorporate prior amendments and acceleration requests and to make other non material changes to the contract entered into in november while we have a contract with thales to construct an additional satellites  including one prototype satellite already constructed  we are currently negotiating with thales to amend the current contract and define a new quantity of satellites with associated terms and conditions  including adjustments to price and schedule 
thales has already completed the procurement of certain long lead time components and parts for six of these satellites and is currently holding these components and parts in storage 
in march  we and thales alenia space entered into an agreement for the construction of the satellite operations control centers  telemetry command units and in orbit test equipment collectively  the control network facility for our second generation satellite constellation 
the control network facility achieved the final acceptance milestone in october in march  we and the launch provider entered into an amended and restated contract to incorporate prior amendments to the contract entered into in september for the launch of our second generation satellites and certain pre and post launch services under which the launch provider agreed to make four launches of six satellites each and one optional launch of six satellites each 
notwithstanding the one optional launch  we may contract separately with the launch provider or another provider of launch services after the launch provider s firm launch commitments are fulfilled 
we successfully launched the first six second generation satellites in october we expect to conduct the next launch of six satellites in may to be followed by two additional launches of six satellites per launch within days following the previous launch 
in may  we and hughes entered into an agreement under which hughes will design  supply and implement a the radio access network ran ground network equipment and software upgrades for installation at a number of our satellite gateway ground stations and b satellite interface chips to be a part of the user terminal subsystem uts in various next generation globalstar devices 
in august  we and hughes amended their agreement extending the performance schedule by months and revising certain payment milestones 
we have the option to purchase additional rans and other software and hardware improvements at pre negotiated prices 
we have begun capitalizing costs based upon reaching technological feasibility of the project 
on march   we entered into an agreement with hughes which extended to july  or earlier if the company obtains additional financing the deadline for us to make all scheduled payments previously due prior to july  the deferred payments will incur interest at the rate of per annum 
if we do not make these required payments by july   we may terminate the contract for convenience 
if the contract is terminated for convenience  then we must make a final payment of million in either cash or globalstar common stock at our election 
if we elect to make payment in globalstar common stock  hughes will have the option either to accept the common stock or instruct us to complete a block sale of globalstar common stock and deliver the proceeds to hughes 
in october  we signed an agreement with oceus networks  a leading global provider of technology and services to telecom operators 
according to the contract  including subsequent additions  oceus will work with us to develop  implement and maintain a ground interface  or core network  system that will be installed at our satellite gateway ground stations 
on march   we entered into an agreement with oceus which extended to february  or earlier if the company obtains additional financing the deadline for us to make scheduled milestone payments which were previously due at various times during the milestones that have been or are expected to be completed and invoiced in  which may be deferred to february   totaled million 
the deferred payments will incur interest at a rate of per annum 
long term obligations at december   assuming borrowing of the entire million under our facility agreement  are as follows in thousands contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt obligations interest on long term debt escrow payments on long term debt   operating lease obligations purchase obligations pension obligations total all of the indebtedness may be accelerated upon default of related covenants 
see note borrowings of the consolidated financial statements in this report 
amounts include payment in kind interest 
approximately million of our debt bears interest at a floating rate and  accordingly  we estimated our interest costs in future years 
the facility agreement requires that we fund a convertible note reserve account by march  equal to and by march  equal to of the notional purchase price of the notes to secure our obligations 
as of december   the estimated notional purchase price was million  which we assume will be paid in however  failure to fund this account if excess cash flow  as defined  is not available is not considered an event of default under the facility agreement 
as stated above  we are currently negotiating with thales to amend the current contract to purchase an additional satellites 
the negotiations are underway to define a new quantity of satellites with associated terms and conditions 
since the results of these negotiations are unknown at this time  we have not included these obligations in the above table 
as stated above  we entered into an agreement with hughes which extended to july  or earlier if the company obtains additional financing the deadline for us to make all scheduled payments previously due prior to july  if we do not make these required payments by july   we may terminate the contract for convenience 
if the contract is terminated for convenience  then we must make a final payment of million in either cash or globalstar common stock 
if the contract is not terminated  the company will owe hughes million in  in and thereafter shown in the respective columns in the table above 
as stated above  we entered into an agreement with oceus which extended to february  or earlier if the company obtains additional financing the deadline for us to make scheduled milestone payments which were previously due at various times during the milestones that have been or are expected to be completed and invoiced in  which may be deferred to february   totaled million 
the million obligation is included in column in the table above 
the purchase obligations for the construction of our first second generation satellites and the control network facility are converted to us dollars using an exchange rate of 
amounts based on when cash payment is scheduled to made 
off balance sheet transactions we have no material off balance sheet transactions 
recently issued accounting pronouncements for a discussion of recent accounting guidance and the expected impact that the guidance and the expected impact that the guidance could have on our consolidated financial statements  see note accounting pronouncements of the consolidated financial statements of this report 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our services and products are sold  distributed or available in over countries 
our international sales are made primarily in us dollars  canadian dollars  brazilian reals and euros 
in some cases  insufficient supplies of us currency may require us to accept payment in other foreign currencies 
we reduce our currency exchange risk from revenues in currencies other than the us dollar by requiring payment in us dollars whenever possible and purchasing foreign currencies on the spot market when rates are favorable 
we currently do not purchase hedging instruments to hedge foreign currencies 
we are obligated to enter into currency hedges with the original lenders no later than days after any fiscal quarter during which more than of revenues is denominated in a single currency other than us or canadian dollars 
otherwise  we cannot enter into hedging agreements other than interest rate cap agreements or other hedges described above without the consent of the coface agent  and with that consent the counterparties may only be the original lenders 
as discussed in item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commitments  we have entered into two separate contracts with thales alenia space to construct low earth orbit satellites for our second generation satellite constellation and to provide launch related and operations support services  and to construct the satellite operations control centers  telemetry command units and in orbit test equipment for our second generation satellite constellation 
a substantial majority of the payments under the thales alenia space agreements are denominated in euros 
our interest rate risk arises from our variable rate debt under our facility agreement  under which loans bear interest at a floating rate based on the libor 
in order to minimize the interest rate risk  we completed an arrangement with the lenders under the facility agreement to limit the interest to which we are exposed 
the interest rate cap provides limits on the month libor rate base rate used to calculate the coupon interest on outstanding amounts on the facility agreement of from the date of issuance through december thereafter  the base rate is capped at should the base rate not exceed 
should the base rate exceed  our base rate will be less than the then month libor rate 
the applicable margin from the base rate ranges from to through the termination date of the facility 
assuming that we borrowed the entire million under the facility agreement  a change in interest rates would result in a change to interest expense of approximately million annually
