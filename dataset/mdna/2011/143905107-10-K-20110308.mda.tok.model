item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview general we operate two types of businesses funeral homes  which account for approximately of our revenues  and cemeteries  which account for approximately of our revenues 
funeral homes are principally a service business that provide funeral services traditional burial and cremation and sell related merchandise  such as caskets and urns 
cemeteries are primarily a sales business that sell interment rights grave sites and mausoleum spaces and related merchandise such as markers and outer burial containers 
as of december   we operated funeral homes in states and cemeteries in states within the united states 
substantially all administrative activities are conducted in our home office in houston  texas 
we have implemented long term strategy in our operations designed to improve operating and financial results by growing market share and increasing profitability 
we introduced a more decentralized  entrepreneurial and local operating model in that included operating and financial standards developed from our best operations  along with an incentive compensation plan to reward business managers for successfully meeting or exceeding the standards 
the model essentially eliminated the use of line item financial budgets at the location level in favor of the standards 
the operating model and its standards  which we refer to as the standards operating model  focus on the key drivers of a successful operation  organized around three primary areas market share  people and operating and financial metrics 
the model and standards are the measures by which we judge the success of each business 
to date  the standards operating model has driven significant changes in our organization  leadership and operating practices 
most importantly  the standards operating model allowed us to measure the sustainable revenue growth and earning power of our portfolio of death care businesses  which then led to the development of our strategic acquisition model  described below under acquisitions  during  which guides our acquisition and disposition strategies 
both models  when executed effectively  should drive longer term  sustainable increases in market share  revenue  earnings and cash flow 
the standards are not designed to produce maximum short term earnings because we do not believe such performance is sustainable without ultimately stressing the business  which often leads to declining market share  revenues and earnings 
important elements of the standards operating model include balanced operating model we believe a decentralized structure works best in the death care industry 
successful execution of the standards operating model is highly dependent on strong local leadership  intelligent risk taking  entrepreneurial drive and corporate support aligned with the key drivers 
incentives aligned with standards empowering managing partners to do the right things in their operations and local communities  and providing appropriate support with operating and financial practices  will enable long term growth and sustainable profitability 
each managing partner participates in a variable bonus plan whereby they earn a percentage of their business earnings based upon the actual standards achieved 
each managing partner has the opportunity to share in the earnings of the business as long as the performance exceeds our minimum standards 
the right local leadership successful execution of our operating model is highly dependent on strong local leadership as defined by our e leadership model  intelligent risk taking and entrepreneurial empowerment 
over time  a managing partner s performance is judged according to achievement of the standards for that business 
funeral and cemetery operations factors affecting our funeral operating results include demographic trends in terms of population growth and average age  which impact death rates and number of deaths  establishing and maintaining leading market share positions supported by strong local heritage and relationships  effectively responding to increasing cremation trends by selling complementary services and merchandise  controlling salary and merchandise costs  and exercising pricing leverage related to our at need business to increase average revenues per contract 
in simple terms  volume and price are the two variables that affect funeral revenues 
the average revenue per contract is influenced by the mix of traditional and cremation services because our average cremation service revenue is approximately one third of the average revenue earned from a traditional burial service 
funeral homes have a relatively fixed cost structure 
thus  small changes in revenues  up or down  normally cause significant changes to our profitability 
our funeral volumes have increased gradually from  in to  in compound annual increase of 
our funeral operating revenue has increased from million in to million in compound annual increase of 
the increases are primarily because of businesses we acquired from through and our ability to increase the average revenue per funeral through expanded service offerings and packages 
we experienced flat volumes in comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december  on a same store basis  although funeral operating revenues for the year ended december  were up compared to the year ended december   which resulted primarily from our acquisitions 

table of contents the percentage of funeral services involving cremations has increased from for the year ended to for the year ended a significant portion of that increase is the result of acquiring businesses in high cremation areas 
on a same store basis  the cremation rate has risen to for the year ended december  the cemetery operating results are affected by the size and success of our sales organization 
approximately of our cemetery revenues relate to preneed sales of interment rights and related merchandise and services 
we believe that changes in the level of consumer confidence a measure of whether consumers will spend for discretionary items also affect the amount of cemetery revenues 
approximately of our cemetery revenues are attributable to investment earnings on trust funds and finance charges on installment contracts 
changes in the capital markets and interest rates affect this component of our cemetery revenues 
our cemetery financial performance from through was characterized by fluctuating operating revenues and field level profit margins 
cemetery operating revenue decreased over prior year although we experienced a increase in trust fund earnings 
also  a increase in at need revenues offset the decline in preneed revenue 
our goal is to build broader and deeper teams of sales leaders and counselors in our larger and more strategically located cemeteries in order to focus on growth of our preneed property sales 
additionally  a portion of our capital expenditures in is designed to expand our cemetery product offerings 
financial revenue we market funeral and cemetery services and products on a preneed basis 
preneed funeral or cemetery contracts enable families to establish  in advance  the type of service to be performed  the products to be used and the cost of such products and services 
preneed contracts permit families to eliminate issues of making death care plans at the time of need and allow input from other family members before the death occurs 
we guarantee the price and performance of the preneed contracts to the customer 
preneed funeral contracts are usually paid on an installment basis 
the performance of preneed funeral contracts is usually secured by placing the funds collected in trust for the benefit of the customer or by the purchase of a life insurance policy  the proceeds of which will pay for such services at the time of need 
insurance policies  intended to fund preneed funeral contracts  cover the original contract price and generally include an element of growth earnings designed to offset future inflationary cost increases 
revenue from preneed funeral contracts  along with accumulated earnings  is not recognized until the time the funeral service is performed 
the accumulated earnings from the trust investments and insurance policies is intended to offset the inflation in funeral prices 
additionally  we generally earn a commission from the insurance company from the sale of insurance funded policies reflected as preneed insurance commission 
the commission income is recognized as revenue when the period of refund expires generally one year  which helps us defray the costs we incur to originate the preneed contract primarily commissions we pay to our sales counselors 
preneed sales of cemetery interment rights are usually financed through interest bearing installment sales contracts  generally with terms of up to five years with such earnings reflected as preneed cemetery finance charges 
in substantially all cases  we receive an initial down payment at the time the contract is signed 
the interest rates generally range between and per annum 
occasionally  we have offered zero percent interest financing to promote sales for limited time offers 
in most states  regulations require a portion generally of the sale amount of cemetery property and memorials to be placed in a perpetual care trust 
we have established a variety of trusts in connection with funeral home and cemetery operations as required under applicable state law 
such trusts include i preneed funeral trusts  ii preneed cemetery merchandise and service trusts  and iii perpetual care trusts 
these trusts are typically administered by independent financial institutions selected by the company 
independent financial advisors are also used for investment management and advisory services 
preneed funeral trust fund income earned and the receipt and recognition of any insurance benefits are deferred until the service is performed 
applicable state laws generally require us to deposit a specified amount which varies from state to state  generally to of selling price into a merchandise and service trust fund for preneed cemetery merchandise and service sales 
the related trust fund income earned is recognized when the related merchandise and services are delivered 
in most states  regulations require a portion generally of the sale amount of cemetery property and memorials to be placed in a perpetual care trust 
the income from perpetual care trusts provides a portion of the funds necessary to maintain cemetery property and memorials in perpetuity 
this trust fund income is recognized  as earned  in cemetery revenues 

table of contents acquisitions our growth strategy includes the execution of our strategic acquisition model 
the goal of that model is to build concentrated groups of businesses in ten to fifteen strategic markets 
we use six strategic ranking criteria to assess acquisition candidates and to differentiate the price we are willing to pay 
those criteria are size of business  size of market  competitive standing  demographics  strength of brand  and barriers to entry 
in general terms  our price expectations range from four to five times pre tax earnings before depreciation for tuck ins to six to seven times pre tax earnings before depreciation for businesses that rank very high in the ranking criteria 
we derive the pre tax earnings amounts based primarily on the size and product mix of the target business applied to our standards based operating model 
during  we completed two acquisitions 
during  we acquired one cemetery and five funeral home businesses 
the consideration paid for these acquisitions was cash  which was generated from our operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  realization of accounts receivable  inventories  goodwill  other intangible assets  property and equipment and deferred tax assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience  third party data and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these considerations form the basis for making judgments about the amount and timing of revenues and expenses  the carrying value of assets and the recorded amounts of liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates and such estimates may change if the underlying conditions or assumptions change 
historical performance should not be viewed as indicative of future performance  because there can be no assurance the margins  operating income and net earnings as a percentage of revenues will be consistent from year to year 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements presented herewith  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
funeral and cemetery operations we record the sales of funeral and cemetery merchandise and services when the merchandise is delivered or service is performed 
sales of cemetery interment rights are recorded as revenue in accordance with the retail land sales accounting principles 
this method generally provides for the recognition of revenue in the period in which the customer s cumulative payments exceed of the contract price related to the real estate 
costs related to the sales of interment rights  which include property and other costs related to cemetery development activities  are charged to operations using the specific identification method in the period in which the sale of the interment right is recognized as revenue 
revenues to be recognized and cash flow from the delivery of merchandise and performance of services related to preneed contracts that were acquired in acquisitions are typically lower than those originated by us 
allowances for bad debts and customer cancellations are provided at the date that the sale is recognized as revenue and are based on our historical experience and the current economic environment 
we also monitor changes in delinquency rates and provide additional bad debt and cancellation reserves when warranted 
when preneed funeral services and merchandise are funded through third party insurance policies  we earn a commission on the sale of the policies 
insurance commissions earned by the company are recognized as revenues when the commission is no longer subject to refund  which is usually one year after the policy is issued 
preneed selling costs consist of sales commissions that we pay our sales counselors and other direct related costs of originating preneed sales contracts and are expensed as incurred 

table of contents goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of funeral home businesses acquired in business combinations is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill has not historically been recorded in connection with the acquisition of cemetery businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment by assessing the fair value of each of our reporting units 
the funeral segment reporting units consist of our east  central and west regions in the united states and we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill using information as of august  in addition  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be greater than fair value 
factors that could trigger an interim impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant adverse changes in the business climate which may be indicated by a decline in the company s market capitalization or decline in operating results 
our goodwill impairment test involves estimates and management judgment 
in the first step of our goodwill testing  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both a market approach  weighted  and an income approach  weighted 
funeral home selling prices are typically quoted in the marketplace as a multiple of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our methodology for determining a market approach fair value utilized recent sales transactions in the industry 
our methodology for determining an income based fair value is based on discounting projected future cash flows 
the projected future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance that may differ from actual future cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital for the company and other public death care companies 
goodwill impairment is not recorded where the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill and if the carrying amount exceeds the implied value  an impairment charge would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
a more complete discussion of the goodwill impairment testing is included below in item of this form k 
income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated us federal income tax return and separate income tax returns in the states in which we operate 
we record deferred taxes for temporary differences between the tax basis and financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities  and account for uncertain tax positions in our financial statements 
the company records a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred tax assets for which realization is uncertain 
management reviews the valuation allowance at the end of each quarter and makes adjustments if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will be realized 
the company analyzes tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and how they are to be recognized  measured  and derecognized in financial statements  provides certain disclosures of uncertain tax matters  and specifies how reserves for uncertain tax positions should be classified on the consolidated balance sheets 
the company has reviewed its income tax positions and identified certain tax deductions  primarily related to business acquisitions that are not certain 
our policy with respect to potential penalties and interest is to record them as other expense and interest expense  respectively 
the entire balance of unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized  would affect the company s effective tax rate 
the company does not anticipate a significant increase or decrease in its unrecognized tax benefits during the next twelve months 
stock plans and stock based compensation the company has stock based employee and director compensation plans in the form of restricted stock  stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
the company recognizes compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of the share based awards over the period of vesting 
fair value is determined on the date of the grant 
the fair value of options or awards containing options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
preneed funeral and cemetery trust funds the company s preneed and perpetual care trust funds are reported in accordance with principles of consolidating variable interest entities 
in the case of preneed trusts  the customers are the legal beneficiaries 
in the case of perpetual care trusts  the company does not have a right to access the corpus in the perpetual care trusts 
for these reasons  the company has recognized financial interests of third parties in the trust funds in our financial statements as deferred preneed funeral and cemetery receipts held in trust and care trusts corpus 
the investments of such trust funds are classified as available for sale and are reported at market value  therefore  the unrealized gains and losses  as well as accumulated and undistributed income and realized gains and losses  are recorded to deferred preneed receipts held in trust and care trusts corpus in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company s future obligations to deliver merchandise and services are reported at estimated settlement amounts 
preneed funeral and cemetery trust investments are reduced by the trust investment earnings that we have been allowed to withdraw in certain states prior to maturity 
these earnings  along with preneed contract collections not required to be placed in trust  are recorded in deferred preneed funeral revenue and deferred preneed cemetery revenue until the service is performed or the merchandise is delivered 

table of contents effective january   a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary  which is sometimes referred to as unconsolidated investment  is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that is reported as a component of equity in the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated net income is reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interest 
the net income  on the face of the consolidated statements of operations  is of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest 
discontinued operations in accordance with the company s strategic acquisition model  non strategic businesses are reviewed to determine whether the business should be sold and the proceeds redeployed elsewhere 
a marketing plan is then developed for those locations which are identified as held for sale 
when the company receives a letter of intent and financing commitment from the buyer and the sale is expected to occur within one year  the location is no longer reported within the company s continuing operations 
the assets and liabilities associated with the location are reclassified as held for sale on the balance sheet and the operating results  as well as impairments  are presented on a comparative basis in the discontinued operations section of the consolidated statements of operations  along with the income tax effect 
there were no discontinued operations in business combinations tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value and goodwill is recognized for any difference between the price of the acquisition and fair value 
we recognized the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at the fair values as of that date 
goodwill is measured as a residual of the fair values at acquisition date 
acquisition related costs are recognized separately from the acquisition and are expensed as incurred 
we customarily estimate related transaction costs known at closing 
to the extent that information not available to us at the closing date subsequently becomes available during the allocation period we may adjust goodwill  assets  or liabilities associated with the acquisition 
fair value measurements we define fair value as the price that would be received in the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
we disclose the extent to which fair value is used to measure financial assets and liabilities  the inputs utilized in calculating valuation measurements  and the effect of the measurement of significant unobservable inputs on earnings  or changes in net assets  as of the measurement date 
additional required disclosures are provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have not elected to measure any additional financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
new guidance was issued during early on how to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities in an environment where the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased 
the new guidance reemphasizes that the objective of a fair value measurement remains an exit price 
this guidance was effective for interim reporting periods ending after june   and has had no affect on our financial position or results of operations 
new guidance was also issued during early that modifies the requirements for recognizing other than temporary impairment on debt securities and significantly changes the impairment model for such securities 
the company considers an impairment of debt and equity securities other than temporary unless a the company has the ability and intent to hold an investment and b evidence indicating the cost of the investment is recoverable before the company is more likely than not required to sell the investment 
if impairment is indicated  then an adjustment will be made to reduce the carrying amount to fair value 
this new guidance also modified the presentation of other than temporary impairment losses and increased related disclosure requirements 
this change was effective for interim reporting periods ending after june  and it has had no affect on our financial position or results of operations 
in the ordinary course of business  we are typically exposed to a variety of market risks 
currently  these are primarily related to changes in fair market values related to long term debt and changes in the values of securities associated with the preneed and perpetual care trusts 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and developing and utilizing appropriate risk management techniques when appropriate and when available for a reasonable price 
the senior notes were issued to the public at par and are carried at a cost of million 
at december   these securities were typically trading at a price of approximately  indicating a fair market value of approximately million 
the convertible junior subordinated debentures  payable to carriage services capital trust  pay interest at the fixed rate of and are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at a cost of approximately million 
the fair value of these securities is estimated to be million at december  based on available broker quotes of the corresponding preferred securities issued by the trust 

table of contents computation of earnings per common share new guidance was issued during early addressing the accounting changes for unvested share based payment awards included in the calculation of earnings per share 
share based awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents  whether paid or unpaid  are recognized as participating securities and included in the computation of both basic and diluted earnings per share 
our grants of restricted stock awards to our employees and directors are considered participating securities and we have prepared our earnings per share calculations to include outstanding unvested restricted stock awards in the basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding calculation 
for the three years ended december   there was no material impact to basic and diluted earnings per share in connection with this accounting change 
subsequent events management of the company evaluated events and transactions during the period beginning subsequent to december  through the date the financial statements were issued  for potential recognition or disclosure in the accompanying financial statements covered by this report 
there were no subsequent events to disclose 
variable interest entities effective january   new guidance amended the current practice of accounting for variable interest entities vie requiring an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest s give it a controlling financial interest in a vie 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a vie as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie

income taxes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the income taxes for and goodwill impairment testing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of funeral home businesses acquired in business combinations is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill has not historically been recorded in connection with the acquisition of cemetery businesses 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment by assessing the fair value of each of our reporting units 
our funeral segment reporting units consist of our east  central and west regional divisions in the united states 
we performed our annual impairment test of goodwill using information as of august  our goodwill impairment test involves estimates and management judgment 
in the first step of our goodwill testing  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we determine fair value for each reporting unit using both a market approach  weighted  and an income approach  weighted 
funeral home selling prices are typically quoted in the marketplace as a multiple of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our methodology for determining a market approach fair value utilized recent sales transactions in the industry  calculated on the basis of ebitda multiples 
our methodology for determining an income based fair value is based on discounting projected future cash flows 
the projected future cash flows include assumptions concerning future operating performance using a weighted average cost of capital for carriage and other public death care companies 
goodwill impairment is not recorded where the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  the implied fair value of goodwill is compared to the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill and if the carrying amount exceeds the implied value  an impairment charge would be recorded in an amount equal to that excess 
based on our impairment test performed using august  data  we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill 
the west region has the greatest risk of failing the first step of the impairment test in the future 
the fair value of the west region exceeded its carrying value by approximately 
as of december   million of goodwill was recorded in the west region 
should industry sales transactions suffer a decline in the multiple of ebitda or the results of the west s operations decline in the future  the risk of goodwill impairment would increase 
in addition to our annual review  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be greater than fair value 
factors that could trigger an interim impairment review include  but are not limited to  significant adverse changes in the business climate which may be indicated by a decline in the company s market capitalization or decline in operating results 
the market capitalization of the company consists of the common stock  senior notes and convertible trust preferred securities 
no such events or changes occurred between the testing date and year end to trigger a subsequent impairment review

important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations reflected in our forward looking statements include those risks related to our business and our industry set forth in item a 
risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are typically exposed to a variety of market risks 
currently  these are primarily related to changes in market values related to outstanding debts and changes in the values of securities associated with the preneed and perpetual care trusts 
management is actively involved in monitoring exposure to market risk and developing and utilizing appropriate risk management techniques when appropriate and when available for a reasonable price 
we are not exposed to any other significant market risks including commodity price risk  nor foreign currency exchange risk 
we monitor current and forecasted interest rate risk in the ordinary course of business and seek to maintain optimal financial flexibility  quality and solvency 
as of december   our outstanding debt is comprised entirely of fixed rate obligations except for the million drawn on the line of credit 
we currently have million outstanding under our million floating rate line of credit 
any further borrowings against the line of credit or any change in the floating rate would cause a change in interest expense 
the senior notes were issued to the public at par and are carried at a cost of million 
at december   these securities were typically trading at a price of approximately  indicating a market value of approximately million 
the convertible junior subordinated debentures  payable to carriage services capital trust  pay interest at the fixed rate of and are carried on our consolidated balance sheet at a cost of approximately million 
the estimated fair value of these securities is estimated to be approximately million at december  based on available broker quotes of the corresponding preferred securities issued by the trust 
increases in market interest rates may cause the value of these debt instruments to decrease but such changes will not affect our interest costs 
the remainder of the our long term debt and leases consist of non interest bearing notes and fixed rate instruments that do not trade in a market  nor otherwise have a quoted market value 
any increase in market interest rates causes the fair value of those liabilities to decrease 
securities subject to market risk consist of investments held by our preneed funeral  cemetery merchandise and services and perpetual care trust funds 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements for the estimated fair values of those securities 
the sensitivity of the fixed income securities is such that a change in interest rates causes an approximate change in the value of the fixed income securities
