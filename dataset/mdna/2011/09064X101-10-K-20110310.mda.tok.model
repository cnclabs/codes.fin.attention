item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a biotechnology company specializing in the development and commercialization of innovative products to promote the healing of musculoskeletal injuries and diseases  including orthopedic  sports medicine and spine applications 
our product and product candidates use rhpdgf bb  one of the principal wound healing and tissue repair stimulators in the body  in combination with tissue specific matrices when appropriate  as our primary technology platform for promoting tissue healing and regeneration 
the matrices are synthetic or natural scaffold materials  such as tcp  which have a history of demonstrated safety and efficacy in previous uses 
this platform regenerative technology may offer physicians advanced biological solutions to actively stimulate the body s natural tissue regenerative process 
we believe that our product candidates  if approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities  may offer new  effective and less invasive treatment options to improve the quality of life for millions of patients suffering injuries or deterioration of bones  ligaments  tendons and cartilage 
through the commercialization of this technology  we seek to become the leading company in the field of orthopedic regenerative medicine 
we have already demonstrated that our technology is safe and effective in stimulating bone regeneration with the us and canadian regulatory approvals of gem s  our first periodontal product  and with the canadian regulatory approval of augment  our first orthopedic product 
we are currently developing a number of other product candidates  including augment injectable  an orthopedic product candidate  and augment rotator cuff  a sports medicine product candidate 
a key priority is obtaining fda marketing approval of augment in the united states 
we received regulatory approval from health canada to market augment in canada in late to date  our product sales revenues have been limited 
however  now that the fda panel meeting has been tentatively scheduled for may  to review our pma application for augment  we believe that we are nearing regulatory approval of augment in the united states 
we anticipate approval of augment by the fda within three to six months after the panel meeting if the panel determines that there is a reasonable assurance that augment is safe and effective and that augment s benefits outweigh any potential risks 
therefore  we anticipate product sales revenues to commence from sales of augment in the united states when  and if  approved 
in addition  we have been incurring expenses in connection with our preparation for an anticipated us commercial launch of augment  and we expect those expenses to increase over the next few quarters as we plan to increase our staffing  particularly in the area of sales and marketing  and accelerate certain activities relating to the build out of our warehouse  distribution and manufacturing facility 
we also remain focused on the commercial adoption of augment in canada  which was approved by health canada in the fourth quarter of we have now completed our transition from a single exclusive distributor to a network of independent sales agents who are more closely managed by us through our canadian national sales manager 
we now have over independent sales representatives representing augment throughout canada 
we have supplemented these efforts with three additional regional product specialists based in the united states  providing technical product support to sales representatives  surgeons and hospital administration 
although we now expect to see an increase in sales as a result of our restructured distribution  the canadian market for augment is limited and we do not anticipate significant revenues from sales of augment in canada 
we expect that our efforts to develop our other product candidates  which include numerous ongoing clinical and non clinical studies  will also start to increase our costs over the next few quarters as a result of continuing costs associated with the ongoing augment injectable clinical trial in canada  the initiation of a rotator cuff pilot clinical study in canada  which occurred in the fourth quarter of  and the initiation of patient enrollment in a north american pivotal trial for augment injectable  which is expected to occur in the first quarter of various milestone payments were required under our agreements with luitpold  kensey nash  and novartis  as well as our intellectual property license agreements with zymogenetics and harvard 
luitpold may be required to make certain milestone payments to us  and we may be required to make certain milestone 
table of contents payments to kensey nash based on the occurrence of certain events 
these milestone payments relate to the achievement of certain clinical developments  regulatory filings  approvals and sales levels for augment injectable 
since our inception in  we have incurred losses from operations each year 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our limited revenues  which at million for the year ended december  consist of product sales  royalty income and sublicense fee income 
although the size and timing of our future operating losses are subject to significant uncertainty  we expect that operating losses may continue over the next several years as we continue to fund our research and development activities  clinical trials  and regulatory and commercialization efforts 
in view of our limited revenue at this time  we continue to closely monitor our cash and investments balance and manage expenses 
the continuing volatile business and economic environment  including the ensuing market instability and uncertainty  as well as uncertainty surrounding the potential fda approval of augment  may continue to impact our general business strategy and may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operation 
for example  the economy may impact the demand for elective medical procedures that we are targeting with certain of our product candidates  or may impact the pricing that we may set for our products  if approved 
accordingly  the impact of the economy on commercial opportunities  such as our anticipated commercial launch of augment in the united states  remains uncertain 
we have responded to the current economic uncertainty by raising capital through the sale of common stock  by investing our cash and investments conservatively  and by employing cost control measures to conserve cash and manage expenses  such as limiting growth in staff  controlling expenditures and postponing certain product development activities where appropriate 
financial operations overview from our inception in through december   we have funded our operations with proceeds from the sale of capital stock  from the licensing and sale of our orofacial therapeutic business  and from research and development agreements  grants  product sales and royalties 
the remaining proceeds of these activities are reflected in the balance of cash and investments totaling million as of december   which includes million in cash and cash equivalents and million in short term and long term investments in us government sponsored enterprise gse securities and corporate bonds that are classified as available for sale 
revenues our recent revenues have been limited and are comprised primarily of product sales  royalty income and sublicense fee income 
we received regulatory approval from health canada to market augment in canada in late to date  our product sales revenues have been limited 
we expect product sales revenues to commence in the united states from the sales of augment when  and if  the fda approves the commercialization of augment 
royalty income for the year ended december  was million  and is based on net sales of gem s as reported to us by luitpold  who owns the rights to the downstream formulation  fill  finish  manufacturing and kitting of gem s 
as part of the agreement to sell our orofacial therapeutic business  including gem s  to luitpold  we expect to continue to receive ongoing royalty payments at least through based on luitpold s net sales of gem s 
sublicense fee income for the year ended december  was million  and is based on the straight line amortization of certain milestone payments previously received from luitpold 
other income and expense other income and expense as reflected in our consolidated statements of operations include interest income and expense  investment income and losses  grant income and various gains or losses resulting from one time or unusual transactions 
we received three government cash grants totaling million during  which were recognized when awarded as other income in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  
table of contents there are no unfulfilled conditions nor any contingent liability for repayment related to either the iwt program or the qtpd program cash grants received by us 
research and development expenses our largest expenditures related to our research and development activities  which were million for the year ended december  we continue to incur research and development expenses due to the substantial expansion of our internal research capabilities and the numbers of patients we have enrolled and expect to enroll in the clinical trials of augment injectable  augment rotator cuff and our other product candidates 
we will make determinations as to which product candidates to advance and how much funding to direct to each on an ongoing basis in response to their scientific and clinical success 
we expect that research and development expenses will start to increase over the next few quarters as a result of continuing costs associated with the canadian augment injectable trial  the initiation of a rotator cuff pilot clinical study in canada  which occurred in the fourth quarter of  and the initiation of patient enrollment in a north american pivotal trial for augment injectable  which is expected to occur in the first quarter of direct external costs represent significant expenses paid to third parties that specifically relate to the clinical development of our product candidates  such as payments to contract research organizations  clinical investigators  manufacture of clinical material  consultants  contract manufacturing start up costs  manufacturing scale up costs  milestone payments and insurance premiums for clinical studies 
in addition  employee costs salaries  payroll taxes  benefits  and travel for employees of the manufacturing  regulatory affairs  clinical affairs  quality assurance  quality control and research and development are classified as research and development costs 
research and development spending for past periods is not indicative of spending in future periods

research and development expenses years ended december  market direct external periodontal     orthopedic    sports medicine     internal periodontal     orthopedic    sports medicine    total     general and administrative expenses we anticipate that our general and administrative expenses  which were million for the year ended december   will continue to increase as we expand our sales and marketing networks to represent our products  as well as our manufacturing operations  facilities and other administrative activities related to our efforts to bring our product candidates into commercialization 

table of contents the successful development of augment and our other product candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development and approval of  or the period in which material net cash flows are expected to commence from  any of our product candidates due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing product candidates  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  future clinical trial results  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the establishment of marketing  sales and distribution  the cost and timing associated with licensing  business relationships and similar arrangements  the cost and timing of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of augment and our other product candidates  the timing and results of our pre clinical research programs  and the effects of competing technologies and market developments  and the industry demand and patient wellness behavior as businesses and individuals cope with the current economic volatility and uncertainty 
any failure to complete the development of augment or any of our other product candidates in a timely manner  or any failure to successfully market and commercialize augment or any of our other product candidates  could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and some of the consequences of failing to do so  are set forth under item a risk factors 
milestone payments various milestone payments were required under our agreements with luitpold  kensey nash  and novartis  as well as our intellectual property license agreements with zymogenetics and harvard 
luitpold may be required to make certain milestone payments to us  and we may be required to make certain milestone payments to kensey nash based on the occurrence of certain events 
these milestone payments relate to the achievement of certain clinical developments  regulatory filings  approvals and sales levels for augment injectable 
our first product  gem s  received approval from the fda in november as a result of the fda approval  we received a million milestone payment from luitpold in december in december  we received a million milestone payment from luitpold upon the second anniversary of the fda approval 
also as a result of the fda approval  we were required to make milestone payments of million to novartis and a total of million to certain patent licensors 
the patent license fees were paid to our licensors as a result of fda approval and receipt of the milestone payments from luitpold upon fda approval  and were capitalized and amortized over the remaining life of the patents 
in november  we executed three agreements that amended agreements that were part of our transaction to sell our orofacial therapeutic business  including gem s  to luitpold amendment no 
to amended and restated exclusive sublicense agreement  amendment no 
to asset purchase agreement  and amendment no 
to agreement terminating research  development and marketing agreement 
the agreement amendments are effective as of november  under these amendments  we continue to have the right to seek european regulatory approval for gemesis  and are still entitled to receive a million milestone payment from luitpold upon obtaining such approval and providing luitpold with the documentation necessary to transfer such approval to them 
we  however  were required to obtain a reclassification of gemesis from a drug product to a medical device prior to march  such reclassification was obtained on november  we are now permitted to continue to seek european approval of gemesis for a period of months following the date of the reclassification until may  if we are unsuccessful with obtaining european approval by may   we will lose our right to seek 
table of contents european approval of gemesis and forfeit the million milestone payment 
in addition  if we successfully resolve all european regulatory issues necessary for gemesis product approval by may  except for quality and or manufacturing issues relating solely to luitpold s quality and or manufacturing operations  we will be deemed to have obtained constructive european approval  and will be entitled to receive of the million milestone payment 
thereafter  we and luitpold will work together to obtain the final european approval at which time we would be entitled to receive the remainder of the million milestone payment 
in order to trigger a milestone payment  any european approval or constructive approval of gemesis must contain the same dosing as currently approved in the united states and canada  include approved indications for the use of gemesis in the treatment of periodontal and gingival defects as a stand alone product  and permit luitpold to market gemesis as currently manufactured by luitpold at its facility 
because of uncertainties in the regulatory review process  we have excluded this milestone payment from our financial guidance for in addition  we were required to make milestone payments to zymogenetics in connection with the initiation of pivotal clinical trials of gem s  certain regulatory filings and approvals for gem s  the receipt of fda approval of gem s  the filing of the augment ide  and the initiation of the augment canadian registration study 
further  we were required to make milestone payments to harvard in connection with the receipt of fda approval of gem s  the initiation of pivotal clinical trials of gem s  our execution of a manufacturing and supply agreement with novartis and our acquisition of certain patents from the institute of molecular biology 
in september  we amended the agreement with kensey nash to amend a development plan  as well as material and product specifications  pricing and conformance  for our augment injectable product candidate and to provide for certain milestone payments from us to kensey nash for the accomplishment of certain development milestones such as the initiation of certain clinical trials  regulatory filings  product approvals  and or commercial launch of augment injectable 
in addition  there are certain time based milestone payments  triggered by such events  payable to kensey nash 
many of the events triggering a milestone payment requirement remain contingent and have not yet occurred  or may occur following the expiration of an agreement 
the only remaining payment to us under these agreements is the million milestone payment that luitpold would be obligated to pay to us when  and if  we obtain eu regulatory approval of gemesis prior to may  excluding this luitpold payment  and assuming that all future contingencies are met and all payments are made not taking into account any expiration of the relevant agreements before such contingencies are met  we anticipate that the milestone payments that we are required to make will result in a net payment by us of approximately million in the near term from to and approximately million in the long term from to 
we have licensed a number of us patents and their foreign counterparts covering various formulations of rhpdgf or manufacturing processes for rhpdgf 
as a part of the licensing agreement relating to such patents  we agreed to pay royalties based on net sales of licensed products under the agreement on a country by country basis during the term of the agreement 
in accordance with such agreement  we are required to make minimum royalty payments for sales of an orthopedic product as follows million in the first full year following the first commercial sale  and million and million in the second and third years  respectively 
based upon the canadian regulatory approval of augment  we shipped our first order of augment to a canadian distributor in december accordingly  we recorded million in royalty expense on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  other than the specific milestone payments listed above  we believe that a substantial portion of future milestone payments are not material to our business or prospects because we anticipate that they will occur well in the future  or they are conditioned upon achieving product sales targets which also are well in the future or represent sales targets which are substantially in excess of the current or foreseeable sales targets  the achievement of which  if attained  would be in the future 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accrued expenses  income taxes  valuation of any losses on purchase commitments  and fair valuation of investments  inventory and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on authoritative literature and pronouncements  historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements 
the results of our operations for any historical period are not necessarily indicative of the results of our operations for any other future period 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report  we believe that the following accounting policies relating to revenue recognition  research and development expense  inventory valuation  valuation of purchase commitments  accrued expenses and deferred liabilities  stock based compensation  income taxes and investments are significant and  therefore  important to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we follow the revenue recognition criteria outlined in asc  revenue recognition includes former staff accounting bulletin  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab  revenue recognition  emerging issues task force issue  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
product sales revenue is recognized upon delivery of the product to the customer 
non refundable license fees under agreements where we have an ongoing research and development commitment are amortized  on a straight line basis  over the performance period 
revenues from milestones are only recognized upon achievement of the milestone criteria 
milestone payments received for sublicense fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the remaining term of the sublicense 
revenues received for ongoing research and development activities under collaborative agreements are recognized as these activities are performed pursuant to the terms of the related agreements 
royalty revenues are received from our sublicensor in arrears based on sales by the sublicensor 
we recognize royalty income on a quarterly basis  when the sales information is received from the sublicensor 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
government grants received in cash are recognized as other income when awarded in accordance with the accounting guidance for government grants as addressed by international financial reporting standards ifrs in international accounting standards no 
 accounting for government grants and disclosure of government assistance  as accounting for government grants is not specifically addressed in us generally accepted accounting principles 
research and development costs we expense costs associated with research and development activities as incurred 
we evaluate payments made to suppliers and other vendors in accordance with asc  research and development formerly sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs  and determine the appropriate accounting treatment based on the nature of the services provided  the contractual terms  and the timing of the obligation 
research and development costs include payments to third parties that specifically relate to the clinical development of our product candidates  including augment  augment injectable and augment rotator cuff  consisting of payments to contract research organizations  clinical investigators  manufacture of clinical material  consultants  contract manufacturing start up costs  manufacturing scale up costs  milestone payments and insurance premiums for clinical studies 
in addition  employee costs salaries  payroll taxes  benefits  and travel for employees of the manufacturing  regulatory affairs  clinical affairs  quality assurance  quality 
table of contents control  and research and development departments are classified as research and development costs 
on january   we adopted emerging issues task force issue  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities now included in asc  research and development  and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations as of and for the years ended december   and inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of our actual cost first in  first out or current estimated market value 
we regularly review existing inventory quantities  expiration dates of existing inventory  and inventory purchase commitments with suppliers to evaluate a provision for excess  expired  obsolete and scrapped inventory based primarily on our historical usage and anticipated future usage 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated change in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
raw materials inventory consists of bulk drug substances  labeling materials  cup trays  cup lids  and other packaging materials used in the manufacturing of our orthopedic product candidates 
work in progress inventory consists of production runs of cups and vials that are not yet approved and finalized for packaging 
finished goods inventory consists of finished cups and vials ready for packaging  as well as packed kits of augment ready for sale 
shipping and handling costs are included in the cost of sales of the product 
reserves for obsolescence  shrinkage  expired inventory and potential scrapping of product batches that may not be released for sale are included in inventory  if appropriate 
cost of sales is also comprised of the following costs raw materials used in the production and manufacturing of vials and cups  testing fees for the vials and cups  labeling materials for the finished kits  packaging materials for inclusion in the finished kit  kit packing costs  freight and scrap incurred during the production process 
the cost of sales will vary in direct correlation to the volume of product sales of augment kits 
valuation of purchase commitments we have substantial firm purchase commitments with our suppliers related to our future inventory needs 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we assess the need for any provision for future losses associated with these future purchase commitments in accordance with asc  inventory and asc  commitments formerly accounting research bulletin arb no 
 restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins 
as of december   no reserves have been recorded associated with these future purchase commitments 
accrued expenses and deferred liabilities as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate expenses that we have incurred for which we have not been invoiced 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed by third parties and the associated cost incurred for such services where we have not been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs 
examples of expenses for which we accrue based on estimates include milestone expenses  salaries and wages  unpaid vacation and sick pay  fees for services  such as those provided by clinical research and data management organizations  investigators and fees owed to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the manufacture of clinical trial materials 
in connection with such service fees  these estimates are most affected by management s projections of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under estimate or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date  and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
management makes these estimates based upon the facts and circumstances known to it at the time and in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents stock based compensation during  our board of directors approved the adoption of the long term stock incentive plan the option plan 
the option plan provides that awards of stock options  other equity interests or equity based incentives in our company may be granted to key personnel at an exercise price determined by our compensation committee  at the time the award is granted  taking into account the fair value of the common stock at the date of grant 
the maximum term of any award granted pursuant to the option plan is years from the date of grant 
the stock options we granted to our employees are structured to qualify as incentive stock options isos 
under current tax regulations  we do not receive a tax deduction for the issuance  exercise or disposition of isos if the grantee meets specific holding requirements 
if the grantee does not meet the holding requirements  a disqualifying disposition occurs  at which time we will receive a tax deduction 
we do not record tax benefits related to isos unless and until a disqualifying disposition occurs 
upon a disqualifying disposition  the entire tax benefit is recorded as a reduction of income tax expense 
we have not recognized any income tax benefit for the three years ended december  for share based compensation arrangements as we do not believe that we will recognize any deferred tax assets from such compensation costs recognized in the current period 
in general  stock option awards granted under the option plan vest per year over a four year period 
the option plan currently provides that upon a change in control all outstanding iso awards held by a qualified employee may  under certain circumstances  be accelerated and exercisable immediately 
upon a change in control  the vesting percentage of an employee s iso award depends upon the number of years of employment at the time of the change in control as follows vested if employed less than one year  vested if employed more than one year but less than two years  vested if employed more than two years but less than three years  and vested if employed three or more years 
effective january   we adopted asc  equity based payments to non employees asc  and asc  compensation stock compensation formerly sfas no 
r  share based payment asc  using the modified prospective method of transition 
under that transition method  compensation expense recognized in the three years ended december  includes a compensation costs for all share based payments granted prior to january   which are based on the intrinsic value method proscribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and b compensation costs for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   which are based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of asc and asc in accordance with asc and asc  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using the following weighted average assumptions amortized to expense over the options vesting periods for the year ended december  risk free interest rate of  expected dividend yield of  volatility factor of the expected market price of our common stock ranged from to  forfeiture rate of and weighted average expected life of the option ranged from to years 
since there is a limited trading history for our common stock  the expected volatility rates are based on historical data from three companies similar in size and value to our company 
the expected terms of options granted represent the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding  and are derived from the contractual terms of the options granted and adjusted for historical experience 
the fair value of each option is amortized over each option s vesting period 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
during the year ended december   we granted stock options to our employees  members of the board of directors  and consultants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a weighted average exercise price of 
our net loss for the years ended december   and includes compensation costs of million  million and million  respectively  related to our stock based compensation arrangements 
no income tax benefit related to our stock based compensation arrangement is included in our net losses 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes utilizing the asset and liability method prescribed by the provisions of asc  income taxes formerly sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is provided for the deferred tax assets related to future years  including loss carryforwards  if there is not sufficient evidence to indicate that the results of operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the net deferred tax asset in future years 
effective january   we adopted a provision asc  income taxes formerly financial accounting standards board fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 to account for uncertain tax positions 
asc prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation prescribes that we should use a more likely than not recognition threshold based on the technical merits of the tax position taken 
tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be measured in order to determine the tax benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
asc also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
as a result of adopting asc  we did not have any unrecognized tax benefits or liabilities  or any associated amounts for interest and penalties 
as a result  there was no effect on our financial condition or results of operations as of and for the years ended december   and investments effective january   we adopted asc  fair value measurements originally issued as sfas no 
 fair value measurements asc  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the asc hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of inputs  or assumptions  used in the determination of fair value and requires financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value to be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities  level inputs other than level quoted prices that are directly or indirectly observable  and level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 
as of january   we adopted asu  fair value measurements and disclosures topic asu 
asu provides amendments to asc to require new disclosures for transfers in and out of levels and  as well as a reconciliation of activity within level in addition  asu provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures regarding levels of disaggregation and inputs and valuation techniques 
in accordance with asc  as amended by asu  we evaluate assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis to determine the appropriate level at which to classify them for each reporting period 
this determination requires for our management to make significant judgments 
see additional discussion regarding the liquidity of our investments in liquidity and capital resources 
results of operations years ended december  and net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the same period in the net loss in included a million realized gain and a million settlement payment related to our previous investments in ars  neither of which was repeated in 
table of contents we anticipate that our operating losses  which are only partially offset by sales  revenues from royalty income  sublicense fee income  grant income and investment income  may continue over the next few years as we continue to fund our research and development activities and clinical trials and as we prepare for a future sales network to represent our products 
product sales revenue although in we received regulatory approval from health canada for sales of augment in canada  our product sales revenues have been limited 
we expect product sales revenues to commence in the united states from the sales of augment when  and if  the fda approves the commercialization of augment 
in november  we changed our distribution strategy in canada  and have completed a transition from a single exclusive distributor to a network of independent sales agents who are more closely managed by us through our canadian national sales manager 
we now have over independent sales representatives representing augment throughout canada 
although we have now begun to see an increase in sales as a result of our restructured distribution  the canadian market for augment is limited and we do not anticipate significant revenues from sales of augment in canada 
cost of sales cost of sales for the year ended december  was less than million 
cost of sales is comprised of the following costs raw materials used in the production and manufacturing of vials and cups  testing fees for the vials and cups  labeling materials for the finished kits  packaging materials for inclusion in the finished kit  kit packing costs  freight and scrap incurred during the production process 
the cost of sales will vary in direct correlation to the volume of product sales of augment kits 
certain raw materials were purchased during fiscal years that preceded the completion of the phase iii clinical trials 
as a result  we expensed the pre launch inventory used for clinical trials as research and development expense recorded on our consolidated statements of operations 
royalty and sublicense fee income royalty income for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in as part of a agreement to sell our orofacial therapeutic business  including gem s  to luitpold  we expect to continue to receive ongoing royalty payments at least through based on luitpold s net sales of gem s 
in the years ended december  and  luitpold s net sales of gem s as reported to us were million and million  respectively 
sublicense fee income for the year ended december  was million  which is comparable to million for the same period in sublicense fee income is based on the straight line amortization of certain milestone payments previously received from luitpold 
research and development expenses research and development expenses relate to new and ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates in the united states  canada  australia and the european union  as well as continuing expenses associated with pre clinical studies and regulatory filings 
these expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the same period in the million decrease resulted in part from a decrease of million in professional services for clinical costs as certain orthopedic clinical trials came to a close in  an increase of million in contract manufacturing costs  milestones  and expenses for validation consulting  regulatory and outside r d costs  and a decrease of million in salaries  benefits  payroll taxes  stock compensation costs  recruiting relocation  freight  small equipment and in general activities of the r d program 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the same period in the million increase resulted in part from an increase of million in salaries  benefits  payroll taxes  and stock compensation costs  an increase of million in professional fees  primarily driven by fees paid in preparation for future commercialization activities  an increase of million in rent and utilities due to the late completion of a new building intended to house certain aspects of our manufacturing operations  and an increase of million in charitable contributions  taxes and licenses  recruiting and relocation  travel and general g a activities 
an increase of million in royalty expense due to a million minimum royalty payment  as required in the first full year following the first commercial sale of an orthopedic product  as commercial sales of augment in canada commenced in december depreciation and capital lease amortization depreciation and capital lease amortization for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the same period in during the year ended december   we purchased equipment  computers and software totaling million 
in addition  during the year ended december   we incurred million in engineering design and planning costs  for a cumulative total of million recorded to construction in process as of december   related to a new building intended to house certain aspects of our manufacturing operations

asu provides amendments to accounting standards codification asc  fair value measurements asc  which was originally issued as sfas no 
 fair value measurements  and adopted by us as of january  
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value  and requires expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
the asc hierarchy ranks the quality and reliability of inputs  or assumptions  used in the determination of fair value and requires financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value to be classified and disclosed in one of the three categories level  level or level 
asu provides amendments to asc to require new disclosures for transfers in and out of levels and  as well as a reconciliation of activity within level furthermore  asu provides amendments that clarify existing disclosures regarding levels of disaggregation and inputs and valuation techniques 
the new disclosures and clarifications of existing disclosures required by asu are effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  except for disclosures in the reconciliation of activity within level  which are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we adopted asu as of january   and the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  subsequent events in february  the fasb issued asu  subsequent events topic amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements asu  to amend asc  subsequent events asc 
asc  which was originally issued by the fasb in may as sfas no 
 subsequent events  provides guidance on events that occur after the balance sheet date but prior to the issuance of the financial statements 
asc distinguishes events requiring recognition in the financial statements and those that may require disclosure in the financial statements 
as a result of asu  companies are not required to disclose the date through which management evaluated subsequent events in the financial statements  either in originally issued financial statements or reissued financial statements 
asc was effective for interim and annual periods ending after june   and asu is effective immediately 
we evaluated subsequent events in accordance with asu  and the evaluation did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december  
table of contents revenue recognition in april  the fasb issued asu  revenue recognition milestone method topic asu 
asu provides guidance for defining a milestone and criteria for determining when it may be appropriate to apply the milestone method of revenue recognition for research or development transactions 
research or development arrangements frequently include payment provisions whereby a portion or all the consideration is contingent upon milestone events  such as the successful completion of phases in a clinical study or achieving a specific result or regulatory approval 
an entity often recognizes these milestone payments as revenue in their entirety upon achieving the related milestone  commonly referred to as the milestone method 
authoritative guidance on the use of the milestone method did not previously exist in the accounting literature 
asu is effective on a prospective basis for milestones achieved in fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning on or after june  our adoption of asu did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet activities  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
effects of inflation because our assets are  to an extent  liquid in nature  they are not significantly affected by inflation 
however  the rate of inflation affects such expenses as employee compensation  office space leasing costs and research and development charges  which may not be readily recoverable during the period of time that we are bringing the product candidates to market 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other adverse effects on the market  it may adversely affect our consolidated financial condition and results of operations in certain businesses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio 
we attempt to increase the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
declines in interest rates over time will  however  reduce our interest income while increases in interest rates over time will increase our interest expense 
due to the short term nature of our cash and cash equivalents  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our cash and cash equivalents 
our cash accounts earned interest rates ranging from to during the year ended december  we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents held in three financial institutions 
our excess cash reserves are invested in overnight sweep accounts  operating accounts  money market accounts and a certificate of deposit 
in addition to the balance of cash and cash equivalents at december   we had million in short term investments in gse securities and corporate bonds classified as available for sale 
also at december   we had million in long term investments in gse securities
