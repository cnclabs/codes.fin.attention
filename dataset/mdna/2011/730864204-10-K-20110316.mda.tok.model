market for electronic table games and changes to marketing strategy 
the game of poker has been increasing in popularity over the past several years with the global market of tables increasing from approximately  to approximately  since the marketing strategy since our inception through mid was focused on targeting opportunities to convert manual poker rooms in traditional markets  such as las vegas  atlantic city  mississippi and louisiana  where the highest concentration of poker tables exists 
during and  after analysis of the market data and an evaluation of retention rates of pokerpro tables placed in those highly saturated poker markets  we shifted our marketing  sales  regulatory and development efforts to those markets with lower poker saturation  including increased focus on international markets 
we believe those markets offer significantly higher product retention and acceptance rates for electronic tables games  such as pokerpro 
in north america  our marketing efforts are focused primarily on markets where electronic table games are either required by law or where other conditions provide for limited competition from manual table games 
in addition  we continue to target potential customers in more competitive markets who are seeking an economical alternative to provide poker as an amenity 
we are also monitoring potential legislative changes in other jurisdictions where state and local governments are seeking to ease budget deficits through expansion of electronic gaming for potential opportunities 
internationally  the poker market has experienced more moderate growth and competition 
many international markets are attractive for our products  where automated table games are either mandated or electronic table games are more accepted than in us markets 
effective january   we obtained the international distribution rights for pokerpro from aristocrat  which allows us to target markets in europe  africa and asia on a direct basis  or through the targeted use of local distributors 
during  we also signed distribution agreements for pokerpro tables in mexico  france and asia 
we believe that significant opportunity exists to increase penetration of pokerpro in those markets 
in addition  with the launch of blackjack pro  we are seeking to expand its addressable opportunities in the same markets and  in many cases  with the same customers as it currently targets with pokerpro 
the marketing strategy for blackjack pro is to target those customers and markets initially where electronic gaming is mandated or otherwise approved  and where gaming is not already saturated 
blackjack is one of the most popular casino table games and we believe the market for electronic blackjack is substantially larger than the market for electronic poker  opening up additional expansion opportunities 
competition 
the overall market for gaming devices is mature and characterized by numerous competitors that develop and license proprietary table games 
we are aware of several other companies offering automated table games  including poker and blackjack products  and additional competitive forces could join the market 
potential competitors include established manufacturers of gaming devices that may have widespread brand recognition and substantially greater resources and marketing capabilities than we have 
in addition  they may have some of the regulatory approvals required to market and sell automated tables in our target markets 
potential competitors also could offer lower cost products manufactured in less regulated or lower cost foreign markets 
we also compete with other gaming and entertainment products for space on the customers floor  as well as for the customers capital spending 
some of the larger gaming supply companies with whom we compete are international game technology  progressive gaming international  shuffle master  inc and wms industries  inc 
there are several companies specifically offering electronic poker and blackjack tables including lightning poker  digideal  amaya  f  shuffle master  inc and zitro 
in addition  we compete with manual table games  internet poker websites and other forms of internet gaming 
product supply 
we purchase all parts  including hardware components  table game felts  signs and accessories for the pokerpro and procore systems from third party suppliers 
we assemble our electronic tables from such component parts at our facility in matthews  north carolina 
we believe that our facility has sufficient capacity to meet demand and that our sources of supply are adequate 
several key components we use in the manufacture of our products are proprietary and are currently manufactured by icp electronics inc icp electronics  which owns approximately of our common stock 
these components include certain complex integrated circuits which are critical to our product designs 
changing manufacturers for any of these components would require significant time and effort on the part of our management team  may require additional engineering development work  and could have a disruptive impact on our operations 
the components we use are produced primarily in taiwan and china and are subject to long lead times and other challenges associated with managing an international supply chain 
furthermore  we compete with other companies for the production capacity of third party manufacturers and suppliers for displays and for other components 
we believe that our contract manufacturer has ample capacity to meet demand and that sources of supply are adequate 
however  because our supply chain crosses the ocean and we rely on a third party  our ability to meet demand is dependent on their performance as well as our ability to provide accurate production forecasts and manage long logistical lead times 
distribution method 
we distribute our gaming products on a direct basis using our own internal sales force and third party distributors in specific markets 
we employ account managers who are assigned geographic sales territories and continue to be closely involved with our customers following the deployment of tables to provide advice and manage the overall customer relationship 
effective january   we obtained the international distribution rights for pokerpro from aristocrat  which allows us to target markets in europe  africa and asia 
we believe that significant opportunity exists to increase penetration of pokerpro in those markets 
gaming regulations and licensing regulatory overview 
generally  the manufacture  sale and use of gambling devices are subject to extensive federal  state  local and tribal regulation 
in order to sell  lease and distribute our electronic table games to our target markets  we must comply with the applicable regulations of each jurisdiction in which we operate 
the regulatory approval process varies widely from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and can take up to twenty four months or longer 
further  the laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate or intend to operate are subject to amendment and reinterpretation from time to time  and therefore it is possible that even if our products are approved at one time  its use may be restricted  conditioned or prohibited in the future 
the following is a brief description of the significant regulations that may apply to us federal regulation 
gaming devices are governed by the federal gambling devices act of the johnson act 
the johnson act generally prohibits the transportation of a gambling device from one state to another unless the receiving state has legalized the use of the gambling device 
the johnson act also requires registration for manufacturers of gaming devices 
commercial casinos 
jurisdictions that allow some form of casino style gambling usually have extensive regulatory requirements that must be met before gaming products can be marketed to commercial casinos located in these states 
generally  each jurisdiction s respective gaming commission requires that a license or finding of suitability be issued with respect to the company  the product  or both 
some jurisdictions also require that gaming products be placed in the market on a trial basis before receiving final approvals 
some jurisdictions require the licenses and findings of suitability to be renewed on a regular basis 
jurisdiction commissions can deny our applications for licenses and findings of suitability or revoke our licenses or prior findings of suitability for any cause 
if a jurisdiction requires that we obtain company approval in addition to the product approval required for the pokerpro system  we are required to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish other information 
our officers  directors  certain key employees and any person having a material relationship with us may have to qualify with the jurisdiction commission and obtain a finding of suitability 
our beneficial owners  especially beneficial owners of more than of our outstanding common stock  may also be required to obtain a finding of suitability 
tribal casinos 
gaming on tribal lands is governed by the indian regulatory gaming act of the igra  the national indian gaming commission the nigc  specific tribal ordinances and regulations and  in some instances  agreements between native american tribes and their respective states  referred to under the igra as a tribal state compact 
the igra provides a statutory basis for native american tribes to operate certain gaming activities  depending on how a particular game is classified and whether the laws of the state where the native american tribe is located allow or prohibit the particular game 
the gaming classifications are class i  class ii and class iii 
class i gaming includes traditional native american social and ceremonial games and is regulated only by the tribes 
class ii gaming includes bingo and certain card games such as poker  so long as the card game is not prohibited by the laws of the state where the tribe is located  the card game is played somewhere in the state and the playing of the card game conforms to any applicable state law 
class iii gaming consists of all forms of gaming that are not class i or class ii  such as video lottery games  slot machines  most table games and keno 
the classification of a gaming device is determined by the operator in each jurisdiction 
we must also obtain prior certification from an independent testing laboratory in certain tribal jurisdictions 
we must also become approved as a gaming supplier with each federally recognized tribe 
card clubs 
states that allow poker to be played in card clubs have various regulatory requirements that apply to manufacturers of gambling devices similar to commercial casinos 
cruise ships 
the cruise ship market is authorized under the johnson act  and not subject to regulatory oversight  therefore  the pokerpro system is currently under no regulatory restrictions aboard cruise ships 
international casinos 
internationally  the regulatory environment is complex and varies by jurisdiction 
certain foreign countries permit the importation  sale and operation of gaming equipment in casino and non casino environments 
in some foreign jurisdictions  such as canada or france for example  we are required to obtain company and product approvals  similar to those in us commercial jurisdictions 
in other foreign jurisdictions  such as mexico  we are required to obtain electrical certifications and comply with certain government regulations  but formal company and product approval processes do not currently exist 
other jurisdictions in latin america  asia  europe  australia and africa have varying degrees of regulation and we evaluate the requirements for each jurisdiction independently prior to entering new markets 
in addition  the regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions are subject to change over time 
regulatory approvals 
as of december  we have obtained regulatory approvals for the company and pokerpro from the following regulatory bodies nevada gaming control board soci t des casinos du qu bec inc arkansas racing commission state of california gambling control commission iowa racing and gaming commission indiana gaming commission mississippi gaming commission west virginia lottery commission tuolumne me wuk tribal gaming agency pokagon band of potawatomi indians eastern band of cherokee indians tribal gaming commission atlantic lottery corporation pokertek holds company licenses from the washington state gambling commission and the alcohol and gaming commission of ontario 
those jurisdictions have not approved pokerpro 
we have received product certifications from gaming laboratories international gli and bmm international bmm  independent testing laboratories for our pokerpro products 
other electrical  communications and safety certifications include conformit europ enne ce  a mandatory european marking for certain product groups to indicate conformity with the essential health and safety requirements set out in european directives  federal communications commission fcc  which regulates radio emissions of electronic devices  the rohs directive rohs  which bans the placing on the european union market of new electrical and electronic equipment containing more than agreed levels of certain hazardous materials  underwriters laboratories  inc ul  a product safety compliance testing laboratory  and nom norma oficial mexicana  a product safety compliance testing standard

seasonality and business fluctuations our business is not generally subject to seasonality 
however  quarterly revenue and net income loss may vary based on the timing of product sales  the introduction of new products and changes in our installed base of pokerpro systems 
in addition  revenues from cruise ships and casinos may vary from quarter to quarter depending on a number of factors  including the time of year  cruise itinerary and length  and customer demographics 
backlog we are generally able to fulfill customer orders with relatively short lead times and do not carry a significant backlog of unshipped orders 
customer dependence for the year ended december   five of our customers made up approximately of our total revenues from continuing operations 
the loss of any of these customers or changes in our relationship with any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business 
employees as of december   we had full time employees 
we consider our relationships with our employees to be satisfactory 
none of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
financial information for information with respect to revenue  operating profitability and identifiable assets attributable to our business segments and geographic areas  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
risk factors 
our business is closely tied to the casino industry and factors that negatively impact the casino industry may also negatively affect our ability to generate revenues 
casinos and other gaming operators represent a significant portion of our customers 
therefore  factors that may negatively impact the casino industry may also negatively impact our future revenues 
if casinos experience reduced patronage  revenues may be reduced as our games may not perform well and may be taken off of the casino floor altogether 
the levels of casino patronage  and therefore our revenues  are affected by a number of factors beyond our control  including general economic conditions  levels of disposable income of casino patrons  downturn or loss in popularity of the gaming industry in general  and table and slot games in particular  the relative popularity of entertainment alternatives to casino gaming  the growth and number of legalized gaming jurisdictions  local conditions in key gaming markets  including seasonal and weather related factors  increased transportation costs  acts of terrorism and anti terrorism efforts  changes or proposed changes to tax laws  increases in gaming taxes or fees  legal and regulatory issues affecting the development  operation and licensing of casinos  the availability and cost of capital to construct  expand or renovate new and existing casinos  the level of new casino construction and renovation schedules of existing casinos  and competitive conditions in the gaming industry and in particular gaming markets  including the effect of such conditions on the pricing of our games and products 
these factors significantly impact the demand for our products and technologies 
our business would suffer if demand for gaming in general  or poker in particular  decreases 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from the licensing and sale of the pokerpro system and from providing related maintenance and support services 
although the popularity of poker in particular and gaming in general has recently been growing in the united states and abroad  gaming has historically experienced backlash from various constituencies and communities 
public tastes are unpredictable and subject to change and may be affected by changes in the country s political and social climate 
a change in public tastes or a backlash among certain constituencies or in certain communities could result in reduced popularity of poker or increased regulation of the gaming industry  either of which could significantly reduce demand for the pokerpro system 
moreover  the market for the pokerpro system is limited 
although we believe that there is a significant opportunity for pokerpro  the number of venues in which the pokerpro system can be placed is finite  as the number of jurisdictions in which gaming is legal is limited 
we are impacted by changes in consumer spending in general  and specifically with regard to discretionary spending on gaming activities 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from the leasing  licensing and sale of the pokerpro system and from providing related maintenance and support 
gaming revenues and occupancy in major gaming markets have been more volatile in recent years  causing many casino operators to reevaluate their operations  reduce expenses  and in some cases to cease operations or seek bankruptcy protection 
we also understand that electronics and other vendors in the far east have experienced volatility of demand from their customers  which could possibly impact their ability to manufacture and deliver products efficiently and at acceptable costs to us 
a prolonged decline in consumer spending on gaming activities could have a significant impact on our customers and our vendors 
accordingly  such a prolonged downturn could have a significant impact on our business operations and financial condition 
we have debt financing arrangements  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial health and our ability to obtain financing in the future  and may impair our ability to react quickly to changes in our business 
our exposure to debt financing could limit our ability to satisfy our obligations  limit our ability to operate our business and impair our competitive position 
for example  it could increase our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions  including interest rate fluctuations  because a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest  require us to dedicate future cash flows to the repayment of debt 
this could reduce the availability of cash to fund working capital  capital expenditures or other general corporate purposes  limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and industry  and limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing due to applicable financial and restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements 
we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future  which could materially increase the impact of these risks on our financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to repay our debt depends on many factors beyond our control 
we may raise equity capital in the future  subjecting our current shareholders to significant dilution 
if we are unable to raise sufficient capital in the future  we may seek other avenues to fund the business  including sale leaseback arrangements  transitioning pokerpro from a capital intensive leasing strategy to a product sale strategy  or seeking to sell assets of all  or a portion of  our operations 
payments on our debt will depend on our ability to generate cash or secure additional financing in the future 
this ability  to an extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
if our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations  and sufficient future financing is not available to us  we may not be able to repay our debt  operate our business or fund our other liquidity needs 
if we cannot meet or refinance our obligations when they become due  this may require us to attempt to raise capital  sell assets  reduce expenditures or take other actions which we may be unable to successfully complete or  even if successful  could have a material adverse effect on us 
if such sources of capital are not available or not available on sufficiently favorable terms  we may seek other avenues to fund the business  including sale leaseback arrangements  transitioning pokerpro from a capital intensive leasing strategy to a product sale strategy  or seeking to sell assets of all  or a portion of  our operations 
if we decide to raise capital in the equity markets or take other actions  our shareholders could incur significant dilution or diminished valuations  or  if we are unable to raise capital  our ability to effectively operate our business could be impaired 
in addition  if we are successful in raising capital in the equity markets to repay our indebtedness  or for any other purpose in the future  our shareholders would incur significant dilution 
the agreements and instruments governing our debt contain restrictions and limitations which could significantly impact our ability to operate our business 
our credit facility with silicon valley bank contains covenants that could adversely impact our business by limiting our ability to obtain future financing  withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general  conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise 
the credit facility includes covenants requiring the achievement of specified financial ratios and thresholds and contains other terms and conditions qualifying the terms upon which silicon valley bank is required to extend funds 
our ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control 
we are dependent on a small number of key suppliers and customers 
changes in our relationships with these parties  or changes in the economic or regulatory environments in which they operate  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our revenues are concentrated with a small number of customers 
the loss of any of these customers or changes in our relationship with them could have a material adverse effect on our business 
to manufacture our gaming products  we purchase components from independent manufacturers  many of whom are located in the far east 
an extended interruption in the supply of these products or suitable substitute inventory would disrupt our operations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for a number of our key inventory components  we rely on a single supplier 
we cannot estimate with any certainty the length of time that would be required to establish alternative supply relationships  or whether the quantity or quality of materials that could be so obtained would be sufficient 
furthermore  we may incur additional costs in sourcing materials from alternative producers 
the disruption of our inventory supply  even in the short term  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a significant portion of our business is conducted with customers and suppliers located outside of the united states 
currency  economic  regulatory  political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our operating results 
our revenues from international customers and our inventory costs from international suppliers are exposed to the potentially adverse effects of currency exchange rates  local economic conditions  political instability and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
to the extent that our revenues and purchases from international business partners increase in the future  our exposure to changes in foreign economic conditions and currency fluctuations will increase 
our dependence on foreign customers and suppliers means  in part  that we may be affected by changes in the relative value of the us dollar to foreign currencies 
although our receipts from foreign customers and our purchases of foreign products are principally negotiated and paid for in us dollars  a portion of our business is denominated in other currencies and changes in the applicable currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of our customers and vendors 
this  in turn  might cause such vendors to demand higher prices  delay shipments  or discontinue selling to us 
this also might cause such customers to demand lower prices  delay or discontinue purchases of our products or demand other changes to the terms of our relationships 
these situations could in turn ultimately reduce our revenues or increase our costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a limited operating history and a history of losses 
we may be unable to generate sufficient net revenue in the future to achieve or sustain profitability 
we have experienced net losses for each quarterly and annual period since our inception in august we may continue to incur losses and cash flow deficits 
for the reasons discussed above and elsewhere in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december   it is possible that we may not generate significant revenues or profits in the foreseeable future or at all 
even if we achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis  and our failure to do so would adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock and may require us to raise additional capital  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our success depends on achieving and maintaining acceptance by casinos and players worldwide 
our success depends on continued market acceptance of our gaming products among casinos and players 
casinos and players may not prefer to use our gaming products for a number of reasons  including preference for live dealers  mistrust of technology and perceived lack of reliability 
we are launching a new product  blackjack pro and expanding into house banked games which have different attributes than our traditional pokerpro business 
the launch of a new product may increase financial pressures and the new product may not be accepted by players or operators  or may not generate sufficient revenue to cover costs 
if we fail to successfully manage our new product development  or if we fail to anticipate the issues associated with such development and expansion  our business may suffer 
the success of our new product introductions depends on a number of factors  including our ability to anticipate and manage a variety of issues such as operator and player acceptance  effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand  and quality problems or other defects in the early stages of new product introduction that were not anticipated in the design of those products 
our business may suffer and we may encounter financial pressure and increased costs if we fail to successfully anticipate and manage these issues associated with the expansion of our product line 
if we fail to obtain or maintain gaming licenses and regulatory approvals  we will be unable to license or sell our gaming products 
the manufacture and distribution of gaming machines is subject to extensive federal  state  local and tribal regulation 
most jurisdictions require licenses  permits and other forms of approval for gaming devices 
most  if not all  jurisdictions also require licenses  permits and documentation of suitability  including evidence of financial stability  for the manufacturers and distributors of such gaming devices and for their officers  directors  major shareholders and key personnel 
our failure to obtain regulatory approval in any jurisdiction will prevent us from distributing our products and generating gaming revenue in that jurisdiction 
any registrations  licenses  approvals or findings of suitability that we currently have or may obtain in the future may be revoked  suspended or conditioned at any time 
the revocation or denial of a license in a particular jurisdiction will prevent us from distributing our gaming products in that jurisdiction  and could adversely affect our ability to obtain and or maintain licenses in other jurisdictions 
gaming authorities in multiple jurisdictions have determined that certain of our executive officers  key employees  directors and significant shareholders are suitable 
the inability of an executive officer  key employee  director or significant shareholder to obtain or maintain a determination of suitability in a jurisdiction may adversely affect the sale or licensing of our gaming products in that jurisdiction 
gaming authorities in some jurisdictions may investigate any individual who has a material relationship with us and any of our shareholders to determine whether the individual or shareholder is suitable to those gaming authorities 
certain of our executive officers  key employees  directors and significant shareholders have been found suitable in multiple jurisdictions by various gaming authorities 
if a gaming authority in any jurisdiction fails to find any of our executive officers  key employees  directors or significant shareholders suitable  we may be prohibited from leasing  licensing or selling our gaming products in that jurisdiction 
a finding of suitability is generally determined based upon numerous facts and circumstances surrounding the entity or individual in question and many gaming authorities have broad discretion in determining whether a particular entity or individual is suitable 
we are unaware of circumstances that would categorically prevent a gaming authority from finding any of our officers  key employees  directors or significant shareholders suitable 
gehrig h 
white  our vice chairman of the board of directors and beneficial owner of approximately of our common stock  has disclosed in applications for the determination of suitability filed with gaming authorities that the irs completed an examination of his and federal individual income tax returns 
the irs issued an examination report showing a proposed income tax deficiency for mr 
white s federal income tax return of  plus additional interest and penalties attributable to that underpayment of tax 
in  mr 
white reached a settlement for his federal individual tax returns 
these amounts have been paid  which successfully completes the examination process for mr 
white s return 
due to the broad discretionary powers of gaming authorities  it is unknown what effect the irs examinations of mr 
white s federal income tax returns may have on mr 
white s applications for a determination of suitability 
if any of our executive officers  certain key employees  directors or significant shareholders is not found suitable in a jurisdiction requiring a finding of suitability  we would be prevented from leasing  licensing or selling our gaming products in that jurisdiction as long as the individual or entity in question remained an officer  key employee  director or a significant shareholder 
such an occurrence would likely delay introduction of our gaming products into such jurisdiction or prevent us from introducing our gaming products in such jurisdiction altogether 
depending on how material such a jurisdiction is to our plan of operations  failure to obtain such findings of suitability could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  a finding that one of our executive officers  certain key employees  directors or significant shareholders is not suitable in any jurisdiction may hinder our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions 
conversely  however  a finding of suitability by one or more gaming authorities does not ensure that similar suitability determinations will be obtained from any other gaming authorities 
although we have the ability to terminate the employment of an executive officer or key employee in the event that such executive officer or key employee fails to be found suitable  such termination would disrupt the management of our company  may trigger severance provisions under certain employment agreements and would likely have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
in addition  the removal of a director under the provisions of our restated bylaws requires action on the part of our shareholders at a shareholders meeting 
our restated articles of incorporation provide that we may redeem at fair market value any or all shares of our capital stock held by any person or entity whose status as a shareholder  in the opinion of our board of directors  jeopardizes the approval  continued existence  or renewal of any federal  state  local or tribal license we hold 
however  we may not have the funds available for such a redemption  especially if the shareholder in question holds a significant amount of our common stock 
we have not determined what action we would take in such an event 
we will also be prevented from effecting such a redemption if it would violate north carolina law 
if the johnson act is found to apply to the pokerpro system  the department of justice may institute criminal and or civil proceedings against us 
gaming devices are regulated at the federal level by the johnson act 
the johnson act broadly defines an illegal gambling device as any machine or mechanical device designed and manufactured primarily for use in connection with gambling and that  when operated  delivers money or other property to a player as the result of the application of an element of chance 
we believe the johnson act does not apply to the use of the pokerpro system by tribal casinos because several courts have held that electronic aids to permitted class ii gaming devices under the igra are not prohibited by the johnson act 
however  there is no guarantee that our belief is correct 
these decisions have focused on the use by tribal casinos of electronic aids to bingo 
we are not aware of any court or regulatory body that has considered how the johnson act applies to the pokerpro system or any other form of electronic poker table 
the department of justice  the primary law enforcement entity responsible for enforcing the johnson act  has traditionally taken a broad view as to what constitutes a gambling device prohibited by the johnson act 
it is possible that the department of justice may institute criminal and or civil proceedings against us and that a court may rule that the johnson act prohibits the use of the pokerpro system by tribal casinos unless the tribe and state have entered into an appropriate tribal state compact 
any such proceedings could interfere with our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
we could face substantial competition  which could reduce our market share and negatively impact our net revenue 
there are a number of companies that manufacture and distribute automated gaming machines 
these companies may have greater financial resources than we have 
the primary barriers to entry are the establishment of relationships with the owners and operators of casinos and card clubs  the receipt of necessary regulatory approvals and the development of the technology necessary to create an automated poker table 
it is likely that our potential competitors could include manufacturers of gaming devices that have already established such relationships and that have received some  if not all  of the regulatory approvals that would be required to market and sell automated poker tables in our target markets 
therefore  the barriers to entry discussed above may not pose a significant obstacle for such manufacturers if they sought to compete with us 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  competitors may be able to use our technology  which could weaken our competitive position  reduce our net revenue and increase our costs 
our long term success will depend to some degree on our ability to protect the proprietary technology that we have developed or may develop or acquire in the future 
patent applications can take many years to issue and we can provide no assurance that any of these patents will be issued 
if we are denied any or all of these patents  we may not be able to successfully prevent our competitors from imitating the pokerpro system or using some or all of the processes that are the subject of such patent applications 
such imitation may lead to increased competition within the finite market for the pokerpro system 
even if our pending patents are issued  our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently comprehensive to prevent our competitors from developing similar competitive products and technologies 
although we may aggressively pursue anyone whom we reasonably believe is infringing upon our intellectual property rights  initiating and maintaining suits against third parties that may infringe upon our intellectual property rights will require substantial financial resources 
we may not have the financial resources to bring such suits and if we do bring such suits  we may not prevail 
regardless of our success in any such actions  we could incur significant expenses in connection with such suits 
third party claims of infringement against us could adversely affect our ability to market our products and require us to redesign our products or seek licenses from third parties 
we are susceptible to intellectual property lawsuits that could cause us to incur substantial costs  pay substantial damages or prohibit us from distributing our products 
whether a product infringes a patent involves complex legal and factual issues  the determination of which is often uncertain 
in addition  because patent applications can take many years to issue  there may be applications now pending of which we are unaware  which later may result in issued patents that our products may infringe 
if any of our products infringe a valid patent  we could be prevented from distributing that product unless and until we can obtain a license or redesign it to avoid infringement 
a license may not be available or may require us to pay substantial royalties 
we also may not be successful in any attempt to redesign the product to avoid any infringement 
infringement and other intellectual property claims  with or without merit  can be expensive and time consuming to litigate  and we may not have the financial and human resources to defend ourselves against any infringement suits that may be brought against us 
defects in  and fraudulent manipulation of  our products could reduce our revenue  increase our costs  burden our engineering and marketing resources  involve us in litigation and adversely affect our gaming licenses 
our success will depend on our ability to avoid  detect and correct software and hardware defects and prevent fraudulent manipulation of our products 
our electronic gaming products are subject to rigorous internal testing  and additional testing by regulators in certain gaming jurisdictions 
we may not be able to maintain products that are free from defects or manipulation and that continue to satisfy these tests 
although we have taken steps to prevent defects  our products could suffer such defects and our products could be subject to manipulation after they have been widely distributed 
although we do not believe it is likely  it is possible that an individual could breach the security systems of a casino or card club  gain access to the server and fraudulently manipulate its operations 
the occurrence of such fraudulent manipulation or of defects or malfunctions could result in financial losses for our customers and the subsequent termination of agreements  cancellation of orders  product returns and diversion of our resources 
even if our customers do not suffer financial losses  customers may replace our products if they do not perform according to expectations 
any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  loss of sales and  in the case of gaming products  loss of regulatory approvals 
in addition  the occurrence of defects or fraudulent manipulation may give rise to claims for lost revenues and related litigation by our customers and may subject us to investigation or other disciplinary action by regulatory authorities that could include suspension or revocation of our regulatory approvals 
if the network infrastructure of certain of the casinos in which our electronic gaming products are or will be installed proves unreliable  market acceptance could be materially and adversely affected 
we have entered into agreements with customers that operate casinos and card clubs in more than one location 
in such cases  our agreement with such customer provides that such customer will be responsible for providing  at its expense  a dedicated high speed connection between the tables in the various locations operated by the customer to a remote central server supporting such tables 
failures or disruptions of a customer s dedicated high speed connection that result in the stoppage of play or in reduced performance of the system could reduce players gaming experience  adversely affect the casinos or card clubs satisfaction with automated gaming devices in general and delay or prevent market acceptance of our electronic gaming tables 
the use of our electronic table games could result in product liability claims that could be expensive and that could damage our reputation and harm our business 
our business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims 
subject to contractual limitations  we will face financial exposure to product liability claims if our products fail to work properly and cause monetary damage to either players or casinos and card clubs 
in addition  defects in the design or manufacture of our products might require us to recall those products 
although we maintain product liability insurance  the coverage limits of policies available to us may not be adequate to cover future claims 
if a successful claim brought against us is in excess or outside of our insurance coverage  we may be forced to divert resources from the development of new products  the pursuit of regulatory approvals and other working capital needs in order to satisfy such claims 
the loss of key personnel or the inability of replacements to quickly and successfully perform in their new roles could adversely affect our business 
all of our existing personnel  including our executive officers  are employed on an at will basis 
if we lose or terminate the services of one or more of our current executives or key employees or if one or more of our current or former executives or key employees joins a competitor or otherwise competes with us  it could impair our business and our ability to successfully implement our business plan 
additionally  if we are unable to timely hire qualified replacements for our executive and other key positions  our ability to execute our business plan would be harmed 
even if we can timely hire qualified replacements  we would expect to experience operational disruptions and inefficiencies during any transition 
if we fail to manage our growth  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we have reduced our operating expenses and significantly reduced the number of employees  placing significant demands on our operational and financial infrastructure 
if we do not effectively manage our growth  our ability to develop and market the pokerpro system could suffer  which could negatively affect our operating results 
our success will depend on the reliability and performance of third party distributors  manufacturers and suppliers 
we compete with other companies for the production capacity of third party suppliers for components 
certain of these competing companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than we have and thus we may be at a competitive disadvantage in seeking to procure production capacity 
our inability to contract with third party manufacturers and suppliers to provide a sufficient supply of our products on acceptable terms and on a timely basis could negatively impact our relationships with existing customers and cause us to lose revenue generating opportunities with potential customers 
we also rely on operators and distributors to market and distribute our products  and we rely on casino customers to operate poker rooms 
if our operators or distributors are unsuccessful  we may miss revenue generating opportunities that might have been recognized our failure to obtain any necessary additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our business 
in order to execute our business plan  we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing 
we may not be able to obtain such additional equity or debt financing when we need it or at all 
even if such financing is available  it may not be available on terms that are favorable to us or in sufficient amounts to satisfy our requirements 
if we require  but are unable to obtain  sufficient additional financing in the future we may be unable to further protect our intellectual property sufficiently  meet customer demand or withstand adverse operating results 
more importantly  if we are unable to raise further financing when required  our continued operations may have to be scaled down or even terminated and our ability to generate revenues would be negatively affected 
enforcement of remedies or contracts against native american tribes could be difficult 
contracts with native american tribes are subject to sovereign immunity and tribal jurisdiction 
if a dispute arises with respect to any of those agreements  it could be difficult for us to protect our rights 
native american tribes generally enjoy sovereign immunity from suit similar to that enjoyed by individual states and the united states 
in order to sue a native american tribe or an agency or instrumentality of a native american tribe  the tribe must have effectively waived its sovereign immunity with respect to the matter in dispute 
moreover  even if a native american tribe were to waive sovereign immunity  such waiver may not be valid and in the absence of an effective waiver of sovereign immunity by a native american tribe  we could be precluded from judicially enforcing any rights or remedies against that tribe 
change in business strategies could adversely impact market success or financial performance 
we recently changed our strategic focus from traditional north american poker markets to a more international focus 
the product may not be successful in those markets and operating in foreign countries carries additional operational  regulatory and currency risk than traditional us markets 
if we are unsuccessful in those markets  or incur significant additional expenses to operate in those markets  our financial results could be negatively affected 
the concentration of our common stock ownership by our founders will limit your ability to influence corporate matters 
our board members and corporate officers combined own approximately of our common stock and therefore have significant influence over our management and affairs and over all matters requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions  such as a merger or other sale of our company or our assets  for the foreseeable future 
this concentrated control will limit your ability to influence corporate matters and  as a result  we may take actions that some of our shareholders do not view as beneficial 
in addition  such concentrated control could discourage others from initiating changes of control 
as a result  the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected 
our board of directors ability to issue blank check preferred stock and any anti takeover provisions we adopt may depress the value of our common stock 
our authorized capital includes  shares of blank check preferred stock 
our board of directors has the power to issue any or all of the shares of such preferred stock  including the authority to establish one or more series and to fix the powers  preferences  rights and limitations of such class or series  without seeking shareholder approval  subject to certain limitations on this power under the listing requirements of the nasdaq stock market llc 
we may  in the future  consider adopting certain other anti takeover measures 
the authority of our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock and any future anti takeover measures we may adopt may in certain circumstances delay  deter or prevent takeover attempts and other changes in control of our company not approved by our board of directors 
as a result  our shareholders may lose opportunities to dispose of their shares at favorable prices generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal and the market price of our common stock and the voting and other rights of our shareholders may also be affected 
there are certain limitations on ownership of five percent or more of our common stock and we will have the right to redeem your shares of common stock if your ownership jeopardizes any regulatory certifications  licenses or approvals we hold 
our restated articles of incorporation provide that no person or entity may become the beneficial owner of or more of our outstanding shares of common stock unless such person or entity agrees to provide personal background and financial information to  consent to a background investigation by and respond to questions from the applicable gaming authorities in any jurisdiction in which we do business or desire to do business 
our restated articles of incorporation also provides that we may redeem any or all shares of common stock held by any person or entity whose status as a shareholder  in the opinion of our board of directors  jeopardizes the approval  continued existence or renewal of any regulatory approval we hold 
the amount that we will pay for such redeemed shares will equal the highest closing price of our common stock  as reported on the nasdaq capital market or other exchange or quotation service on which our common stock is then listed or quoted  during the days immediately preceding the date on which notice of redemption is given 
this provision may force you to sell your shares of common stock before you would choose to do so and may cause you to realize a loss on your investment 
our common stock price has been volatile 
fluctuations in our stock price could impair our ability to raise capital and make an investment in our securities undesirable 
historically  the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly 
we believe factors such as the market s acceptance of our products and the performance of our business relative to market expectations  as well as general volatility in the securities markets  could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations  resulting in changes in the market prices of the stock of many companies  which may not have been directly related to the operating performance of those companies 
fluctuations in our stock price could impair our ability to raise capital and make an investment in our securities undesirable 
during the one year period ending december   the closing price of our common stock as quoted on the nasdaq capital market ranged from a low of to a high of 
over the last year  our shares of common stock were at risk of being delisted by nasdaq from trading since they traded at less than per share 
over the last year  our shares have traded below the minimum bid price required for continued listing on nasdaq 
if we do not ultimately increase our stock price above per share and maintain all other listing conditions  we could be required to take certain actions to remain listed 
if unsuccessful  our common stock could be delisted and transferred to the over the counter bulletin board quotation service 
on march   we received a letter from nasdaq s listing qualifications department dated march  that stated that the staff had made a determination that our common stock would be delisted from the nasdaq capital market 
the determination was based on the fact that the bid price of our common stock had not closed above for a consecutive period of ten days during the preceding days 
we appealed the staff s determination to a hearing panel and presented its plan to regain compliance 
on may   we received notification from nasdaq indicating that the company s shares had traded above the minimum bid price requirement for ten consecutive days and we were compliant with the applicable listing requirement for the nasdaq capital market 
on july   we received a letter from the nasdaq stock market indicating that the closing bid price of its common stock had fallen below for the consecutive business days from may  to june   and therefore  we were not in compliance with nasdaq listing rule a as of july  nasdaq provided an automatic day grace period  through december   to regain compliance with the bid price rule by maintaining a closing bid price of per share for a minimum of consecutive business days 
on december   we received a letter from the nasdaq listings qualifications department which indicated that a staff determination had been made to the effect that our common stock would be delisted from the nasdaq capital market since we have not regained compliance with the rule during the day period 
the bid price of our common stock did not close above for a day period between july  and december  we appealed the staff s determination to a hearing panel and presented its plan to regain compliance which included a reverse stock split 
as of february   we implemented a for reverse stock split to increase the bid price of our common stock see note subsequent events 
following the reverse stock split  our shares have closed above the minimum bid price requirement  however the hearings panel has elected to exercise its discretion to require trading above in excess of ten trading days before determining compliance 
nasdaq also requires listed companies to maintain a minimum shareholder s equity balance of million 
as of december   our shareholder s equity was million  which is in compliance with the nasdaq requirement 
however  we have a historyof net losses and the hearings panel has requested additional information to aid in assessing our long term compliance plans with regard to the minimum bid price  shareholder s equity and other listing requirements  before determining compliance
