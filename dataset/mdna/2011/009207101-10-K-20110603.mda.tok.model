item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company operates in three business segments 
the overnight air cargo segment  comprised of its mountain air cargo  inc mac and csa air  inc csa subsidiaries  operates in the air express delivery services industry 
the ground equipment sales segment  comprised of its global ground support  llc ggs subsidiary  manufactures and provides mobile deicers and other specialized equipment products to passenger and cargo airlines  airports  the u 
s 
military and industrial customers 
the ground support services segment  comprised of its global aviation services  llc gas subsidiary  provides ground support equipment maintenance and facilities maintenance services to domestic airlines and aviation service providers 
each business segment has separate management teams and infrastructures that offer different products and services 
the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on operating income 
following is a table detailing revenues by segment and by major customer category dollars in thousands year ended march  overnight air cargo segment fedex ground equipment sales segment military commercial domestic commercial international ground support services segment mac and csa are short haul express airfreight carriers and provide overnight air cargo services to one primary customer  fedex corporation fedex 
mac also on occasion provides maintenance services to other airline customers and the u 
s 
military 
under the terms of dry lease service agreements  which currently cover all of the revenue aircraft  the company receives a monthly administrative fee based on the number of aircraft operated and passes through to its customer certain cost components of its operations without markup 
the cost of fuel  flight crews  landing fees  outside maintenance  parts and certain other direct operating costs are included in operating expenses and billed to the customer as cargo and maintenance revenue  at cost 
pursuant to such agreements  fedex determines the type of aircraft and schedule of routes to be flown by mac and csa  with all other operational decisions made by the company 
these agreements are renewable on two to five year terms and may be terminated by fedex at any time upon days notice 
the company believes that the short term and other provisions of its agreements with fedex are standard within the airfreight contract delivery service industry 
fedex has been a customer of the company since loss of its contracts with fedex would have a material adverse effect on the company 
mac and csa combined revenues increased by  in fiscal see the following comparison of fiscal year to for details of the increase 
ggs manufactures and supports aircraft deicers and other specialized industrial equipment on a worldwide basis 
ggs manufactures five basic models of mobile deicing equipment with capacities ranging from to  gallons 
ggs also offers fixed pedestal mounted deicers 
each model can be customized as requested by the customer  including single operator configuration  fire suppressant equipment  open basket or enclosed cab design  a patented forced air deicing nozzle and on board glycol blending system to substantially reduce glycol usage  color and style of the exterior finish 
ggs also manufactures five models of scissor lift equipment  for catering  cabin service and maintenance service of aircraft  and has developed a line of decontamination equipment  flight line tow tractors  glycol recovery vehicles and other special purpose mobile equipment 
ggs competes primarily on the basis of the quality  performance and reliability of its products  prompt delivery  customer service and price 
in june  ggs was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the usaf 
ggs was awarded two three year extensions of that contract through june on july   the company announced that ggs had been awarded a new contract to supply deicing trucks to the usaf 
the contract award was for one year with four additional one year extension options that may be exercised by the usaf 
in june  the first option period under the contract was exercised  extending the contract to july ggs revenues decreased by  less than in fiscal see the following comparison of fiscal year to for details of the decrease 
gas was formed in september to operate the aircraft ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services business of the company 
gas is providing aircraft ground support equipment and airport facility maintenance services to a wide variety of customers at a number of locations throughout the country 
gas revenues decreased by  in fiscal see the following comparison of fiscal year to for details of the decrease 
fiscal highlights after three consecutive years of record gross revenues and net profits  the company experienced a decline in both in our prior fiscal year ended march   reflecting very difficult economic and industry conditions 
while revenues have increased by  in the fiscal year ended march   net profits have further declined  as discussed below 
our overnight air cargo segment was a strong performer  as revenues for the segment totaled  for the year ended march   representing a  increase over the prior year 
the segment also saw its operating income increase by  or in fiscal during the second quarter of our fiscal  fedex delivered four additional atr passenger aircraft to mac for heavy maintenance work 
during the third quarter  one of the aircraft was completed and put onto mac s operating certificate and is being operated by mac as of november we are unable to determine at this time whether mac will ultimately operate the other three aircraft as revenue aircraft 
however  we are receiving administrative fee revenue and maintenance labor revenue on the aircraft as we perform heavy maintenance services and prepare the aircraft for conversion to freighter configuration 
the heavy maintenance work to be performed by mac on the remaining three aircraft was essentially completed as of the end of fiscal revenues for ggs for the year ended march  were down less than from the prior year  while operating income decreased by  or 
while ggs revenues were fairly flat overall  there was a significant shift in the composition of revenues 
revenues from the u 
s 
military decreased to of ggs revenues in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
while ggs was able to renew the deicer contract with the air force in july  ggs did not deliver any orders under this contract during fiscal revenues from domestic commercial customers increased to of ggs revenues in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
in november  ggs was awarded a contract to provide million of deicing trucks and training simulators to the city of charlotte  north carolina  for use at the charlotte douglas international airport 
as of march   ggs had delivered million of units under the contract with the remainder delivered in the first quarter of fiscal and finally  revenues from international customers increased to of ggs revenues in fiscal compared to in the prior year 
ggs s gross margin percentage was dramatically affected by these changes in customer base as the commercial business  both domestically and internationally  has been a highly competitive environment 
in addition  the air force work allowed us to be much more flexible in our deliveries and production  which contributed to greater efficiencies and a lower overall cost structure 
during the year ended march   revenues from our gas subsidiary totaled  representing a  decrease from the prior year 
in july  after a highly competitive bidding process  gas was notified of changes to its contract with delta airlines  which has resulted in a significant reduction in the scope of work performed for delta  principally beginning in september the services that were reduced  which included the elimination of services at gas s largest delta location  accounted for almost half of gas s historical revenues and a greater proportion of its operating income 
the impact of the reductions is reflected in the operating results for the second half of fiscal gas continues to seek out new customers and locations to build its revenue base but expects to see lower margins than it produced prior to the delta contract revisions 
fiscal vs 
consolidated revenue increased  to  for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the prior fiscal year 
the increase in revenue resulted from a number of offsetting factors 
revenues in the overnight air cargo segment increased  to  largely as a result of increases in administrative fee revenue and maintenance labor revenue relating to the four atr aircraft that were delivered by fedex during the second quarter  as well as increases in flight and maintenance operating costs passed through to our customer at cost 
heavy maintenance on one of the atr aircraft was completed and it was placed into revenue service during the third quarter and heavy maintenance work on the remaining three aircraft has been substantially completed at march  revenues in the ground equipment sales segment decreased by  less than to  while the overall decrease in that segment was minimal  there was a significant swing in the product and customer mix principally resulting from the lack of deicer sales to the usaf during fiscal  offset by increased deicer sales in both the commercial domestic and international markets 
revenues in the ground support services segment decreased by  to  resulting from the reduction in scope of work performed for delta within this segment during the last half of fiscal operating expenses on a consolidated basis increased  to  for fiscal compared to fiscal the increase was due to a number of factors 
operating expenses in the overnight air cargo segment were up  corresponding to the increase in revenues within that segment 
ground equipment sales operating costs increased  
ggs s gross margin percentage was dramatically affected by changes in customer base as the commercial business  both domestically and internationally  has increased significantly in a highly competitive environment 
in addition  the air force work  which decreased dramatically  allowed us to be much more flexible in our deliveries and production  which contributed to greater efficiencies and a lower overall cost structure 
operating expenses in the ground support services segment decreased by  largely a result of the reduction in work performed for delta 
general and administrative expense decreased  to  in fiscal the company incurred reduced compensation expense of  related to stock options 
profit sharing expense decreased by  directly related to the decreased profit generated by the company in fiscal these large decreases were offset by an  increase in employee benefit costs  a  increase in the provision for bad debts and lesser increases in salary and other overhead costs 
the increase in provision for bad debts was due to fully reserving for an  non trade receivable that was deemed uncollectible in the fourth quarter of fiscal operating income for the year ended march  was  a  decrease from fiscal the reduction was principally the result of the reduced gross margin and profitability in the ground equipment sales segment as previously discussed 
non operating income  net for the year ended march  was  is principally interest income  and is consistent with the prior year 
income tax expense of  in fiscal represented an effective tax rate of  which included the benefit of current year foreign tax credits  as well as the us production deduction 
in addition  the fiscal tax provision included other adjustments for an over statement of puerto rico tax credits and other accumulated items in prior periods 
income tax expense of  in fiscal represented an effective tax rate of  which included the true up of federal income taxes on prior year filings  the benefit of prior and current year foreign tax credits  as well as the us production deduction 
net earnings were  or 
per diluted share for the year ended march   a decrease from earnings of  or per diluted share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of march   the company held approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
of this amount  million was invested in liquid money market accounts and a month bank certificate of deposit 
all invested amounts are fully insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  with the exception of million held in money market accounts 
as of march   the company s working capital amounted to  an increase of  compared to march  the increase resulted principally from the earnings generated from operations  which is our primary source of liquidity 
the company has a  secured long term revolving credit line with an expiration date of august  the revolving credit line contains customary events of default  a subjective acceleration clause and a fixed charge coverage requirement  with which the company was in compliance at march  the company had no outstanding obligations under its line of credit at march  and see note in the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this report  for further discussion 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on its line of credit 
although the line had no outstanding balance at march  and  the line of credit did have a weighted average balance outstanding of approximately  during the year ended march  if the libor interest rate had been increased by one percentage point  based on the weighted average balance outstanding for the year  the change in annual interest expense would have been negligible 
following is a table of changes in cash flow for the respective years ended march  and year ended march  net cash provided by used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash provided by operating activities was  less for fiscal compared to fiscal the major components of this cash flow decrease were a significant increase in accounts receivable in fiscal  while decreasing only marginally in fiscal and a significant increase in inventories in fiscal compared to a decrease in fiscal there was a lesser offsetting impact related to the increase in accounts payable in fiscal accounts receivable increased due to significant deliveries in march as well as increased sales to international customers with extended payment terms in fiscal inventories have increased as a result of increased backlog in march cash flows from investing activities were  higher in fiscal  largely due to the company decreasing its position in short term investments in fiscal whereas the company had increased its investment in short term investments in fiscal the change in investments was solely due to seeking appropriate returns and risk on invested cash 
capital expenditures increased by  in fiscal compared to the prior year 
cash used in financing activities was  less in fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to the payoff of an aircraft term loan in fiscal there are currently no commitments for significant capital expenditures 
the company s board of directors  on august   adopted the policy to pay an annual cash dividend in the first quarter of each fiscal year  in an amount to be determined by the board 
on may  the company declared a 
per share cash dividend  to be paid on june  to shareholders of record june  off balance sheet arrangements the company defines an off balance sheet arrangement as any transaction  agreement or other contractual arrangement involving an unconsolidated entity under which a company has made guarantees  a retained or a contingent interest in transferred assets  an obligation under derivative instruments classified as equity  or any obligation arising out of a material variable interest in an unconsolidated entity that provides financing  liquidity  market risk or credit risk support to the company  or that engages in leasing  hedging  or research and development arrangements with the company 
the company is not currently engaged in the use of any of these arrangements 
impact of inflation the company believes that inflation has not had a material effect on its manufacturing operations  because increased costs to date have been passed on to its customers 
under the terms of its overnight air cargo business contracts the major cost components of its operations  consisting principally of fuel  crew and other direct operating costs  and certain maintenance costs are reimbursed by its customer 
significant increases in inflation rates could  however  have a material impact on future revenue and operating income 
seasonality ggs s business has historically been seasonal 
the company has continued its efforts to reduce ggs s seasonal fluctuation in revenues and earnings by increasing military and international sales and broadening its product line to increase revenues and earnings throughout the year 
in june  ggs was awarded a four year contract to supply deicing equipment to the united states air force  and subsequently was awarded two three year extensions on the contract  which expired in june in july  ggs was awarded a new one year contract with the united states air force with four additional one year extension options 
although sales remain somewhat seasonal  particularly with regard to commercial deicers which typically are delivered prior to the winter season  this diversification has lessened the seasonal impacts in the past when sales under the contract with the united states air force were a significant component of the company revenues 
if sales to the united states air force do not continue to be a significant component of ggs s sales  seasonal patterns of revenues and earnings attributable to its commercial deicer business may resume 
the overnight air cargo and ground support services segments are not susceptible to seasonal trends 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements in
