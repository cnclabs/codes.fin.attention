shermen renamed westway group  inc upon completion of the business combination in exchange for common and preferred stock and cash 
previously  shermen was organized in as a special purpose acquisition company solely for the purpose of acquiring  through a merger  capital stock exchange  asset acquisition  stock purchase or other similar business combination  an operating business 
the business combination was completed on may   whereby the bulk liquid storage and liquid feed supplements businesses of the ed f man group were acquired by shermen 
in exchange  we paid million in cash and issued  shares of our class b common stock and  shares of our series a convertible preferred stock to a subsidiary of ed f man of which  shares of series a convertible preferred stock were deposited in escrow for release upon our achievement of certain earnings or share price targets 
we also incurred one time business combination expenses of million for advisory  investment 
table of contents banking  accounting  legal  and other professional and consulting fees 
ed f man and its affiliates became our largest stockholder  owning of our total outstanding common stock and of our series a convertible preferred stock 
shermen s name was changed to westway group  inc upon completion of the business combination 
to facilitate the business combination and for other purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures  we and ed f man treasury management plc ed f man treasury  an affiliate of ed f man  entered into a credit facility agreement whereby ed f man treasury agreed to make available a million two year revolving credit facility to us 
additionally  ed f man treasury agreed to provide an incremental million foreign exchange facility  an incremental million foreign currency overdraft facility  and a facility for standby and documentary letters of credit  bonds  and guarantees to us 
the credit facility agreement was paid off and terminated in its entirety in november when we directly obtained a million year revolving credit facility from a syndicate of banks 
lines of business  locations of operations  and principal products and services we currently own and operate an extensive global network of operating bulk liquid storage facilities  providing approximately million gallons of total capacity  and operating liquid feed supplement manufacturing facilities  producing approximately million tons of liquid feed supplements annually 
our bulk liquid storage business is a global business with infrastructure that includes a network of terminals offering storage to manufacturers and consumers of agricultural and industrial liquids  located at key port and terminal locations throughout north america  in western europe  and in asia 
we coordinate closely with our customers in designing and adapting the customized product handling systems required for their specific products 
our value added services are customer specific and also include transloading of bulk liquids and acting as regional distribution centers for our customers 
a key strategic aspect of our storage business is the fact that it has maintained a long term presence in a number of highly critical  deep water ports from which it can offer its international customers access to multiple storage locations combined with the highest level of service in these important markets 
our liquid feed supplements business produces liquid animal feed supplements that are sold directly to end users  feed manufacturers  distributors primarily supplying beef and dairy  and livestock industries 
by using formulation processes that are tailored specifically to the needs of our customers  we blend molasses and essential nutrients to form feed rations that help livestock to reach their genetic potential 
our manufacturing and distribution locations allow us to provide nutritional liquid feed supplements to the majority of the us and canadian livestock market 
in addition  of our facilities are positioned at deep water port locations  allowing for the more efficient receipt of imported ingredients such as molasses and condensed molasses solubles  and therefore provide a competitive advantage to us since approximately of the molasses consumed for livestock supplements in the us is imported 
the balance of our manufacturing locations are either strategically located on navigable inland river systems or have direct railroad access 
we believe that our liquid feed supplements business is the leading north american manufacturer of liquid animal feed supplements and the only such supplier with a true national footprint in the us our corporate segment includes unallocated general and administrative expenses including  in part  executive  legal  finance  information technology  human resources  and health  safety  environmental  and quality expenses  as well as interest expenses related to corporate debt 
the company is headquartered in new orleans  la and has employees worldwide as of march

additionally  we began several construction projects  including capacity expansions at our amsterdam  netherlands terminal to add million gallons of storage capacity and our houston terminal to add million gallons of storage capacity  a rail expansion at our houston facility to increase our rail storage  and a new dock line at our gray s harbor facility to providing multiple dock access 
warrant tender offer in august  we commenced a tender offer for approximately million of our outstanding publicly traded warrants 
ultimately  by the expiration of our tender offer in september  approximately million warrants were tendered  and they were exchanged shortly thereafter for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million and  shares of our class a common stock

expanded credit facility in november  our bank credit facility was amended to include certain financial covenants in our credit agreement which provides financial capacity for planned expansions and possible future acquisitions 
we also exercised the accordion feature of our credit facility  with the unanimous consent of the banks committing additional funds  increasing the total lender commitment under the facility by million  to a total of million 
we were pleased with the willingness of our syndicate of quality banks to commit significant additional funding to us 
liquid feed supplement achievements in  we signed an exclusive supply agreement to market condensed molasses solubles within the us  mexico  canada  australia  and new zealand  as well as brought to market two new products 
also in  we entered into an addendum to our molasses supply agreement with the ed f man group to provide us with a more favorable supply and pricing through september we also completed construction of two additional tanks totaling  gallons of capacity at our catoosa  ok facility 
for more detailed information on events  please see our recent developments section in item commercial arrangements with the ed f man group as a result of the business combination on may   ed f man and its affiliates became our largest stockholder  owning of our outstanding class b common stock  which constitutes of all of our outstanding common stock  and of our outstanding series a convertible preferred stock  a portion of which was deposited into escrow for release upon the achievement of certain earnings or stock price targets 
the acquired business was owned by ed f man prior to the business combination and had a commercial relationship with the ed f man group 
after the business combination  a commercial relationship has continued and it now centers on the following agreements 
bulk liquid storage arrangements our long term relationship as a supplier of bulk liquid storage to the ed f man group s various trading divisions has contributed to our performance 
we believe that our relationship with the ed f man group provides us with global expansion opportunities 
as a supplier  we expect to capitalize on the relationship  which should provide new business to both our existing and new locations 
we and the ed f man group have a long term storage agreement that addresses our supplier status 
the terms of our agreement have a pricing mechanism that approximates fair market value for the services provided 
in  our bulk liquid storage net revenue earned from the ed f man group was million  representing of our total bulk liquid storage revenue 

table of contents molasses supply arrangements molasses is an important ingredient utilized in our liquid feed supplement formulations 
we and the ed f man group have a long term molasses supply agreement  pursuant to which the ed f man group is our primary supplier of cane molasses 
the pricing for the purchase of molasses is based on formula pricing determined in part by prices charged by the ed f man group to third parties as specified in the supply agreement 
in  our cost of purchases from the ed f man group was million  representing of total liquid feed supplements cost of sales 
insurance participation agreement we have a participation agreement with a captive insurance company owned by the ed f man group

as of december   the net deposits were million 
our international subsidiaries are currently transitioning these treasury management services to jpmorgan chase bank 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap requires management to make assumptions  judgments  and other estimates that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
in any given period  the actual facts and results could differ materially from the estimates used in preparing financial statements 
a detailed summary of our significant accounting policies appears in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
certain of these policies involve accounting estimates that we deem critical due to the subjectivity  complexity  or difficulty of the assumptions  judgments  or other estimates required to be made  the degree of uncertainty at the time the assumption  judgment  or other estimate is made  and the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported using different assumptions  judgments  or other estimates 
management periodically discusses the development  selection  application  and disclosure of our key accounting policies  as well as the critical accounting estimates  with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the accounting estimates we currently consider to be critical are as follows acquisitions our acquisitions of businesses that resulted in our control of these businesses are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition  with 
table of contents the remainder  if any  recorded as goodwill 
the fair values are determined by our management  taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired business and other relevant information 
such information includes valuations supplied by independent appraisal for significant business combinations 
the valuations are based on one or more of three methods future cash flow projections for the acquired assets  discounted to present value income approach  the price at which comparable assets are purchased under similar circumstances market approach  and an estimate of the current cost to purchase or replace the asset cost approach 
the determination of fair value requires significant judgment by management 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the final allocation is expected to be made within one year of the acquisition 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we perform at least an annual impairment review of goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset is greater than its fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  identification of other impaired assets within a reporting unit  the disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit  significant adverse changes in business climate or regulations  significant changes in senior management  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  a decline in our credit rating  or a reduction of our market capitalization relative to net book value 
determining whether a triggering event has occurred requires management to make significant judgments 
our annual impairment review is based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on projected discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of our reporting units based on comparable market multiples 
the determination of the fair value of the reporting units requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include but are not limited to  in the case of the market approach  to the selection of appropriate peer group companies  control premiums appropriate for acquisitions in the industries in which we compete  and in the case of the income approach  to the selection of the discount rate  terminal growth rates  forecasts of revenue and expense growth rates  changes in working capital  depreciation and amortization  and capital expenditures 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making our estimates  actual financial results could differ from those estimates 
changes in assumptions concerning future financial results or other underlying assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value of the reporting unit or the amount of any possible goodwill impairment charge 
for purposes of goodwill assignment and subsequent review  it is necessary to determine appropriate reporting units for the company 
we determined that it was appropriate to use reporting units  consisting of one reporting unit for our liquid feed supplements business and reporting units related to our bulk liquid storage sites 
the determination of reporting units is based whether discrete financial information is available which management regularly reviews  along with aggregation criteria based on geographic location  sizes  and economic characteristics 
our five bulk liquid storage operating facilities located in the united kingdom have been grouped into a single reporting unit due to their similar location  size  and economic characteristics 
our total goodwill of million related to the may business combination was allocated between our two businesses  bulk liquid storage and liquid feed supplements  based on fair value concepts including a combination of income  market  and cost approaches used in the may purchase price allocation 
with respect to our bulk liquid storage business  we further allocated the goodwill to the united kingdom reporting unit and the other bulk liquid storage reporting units based on historical profitability percentages 
as of october   our reporting units had an aggregate goodwill balance of million prior to our annual impairment assessment 
we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment as of october  and compared the weighted average fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value as of october  this indicated that out of the reporting units  one reporting unit  our ireland site  had a carrying value 
table of contents which exceeded its fair value 
accordingly  we then determined the implied fair value of goodwill of the ireland reporting unit by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the aggregate fair value of all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
as a result  we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill of the ireland reporting unit was zero and therefore recorded a non cash impairment charge to our goodwill of approximately million  which was the entire amount of goodwill that had been allocated to the ireland reporting unit 
the impairment of the goodwill at our ireland reporting unit  which consists of storage tanks in dublin with an aggregate capacity of million gallons  was primarily due to a continued decline in the irish economy and the consequent reductions in our future revenue projections for the facility 
the original allocation of goodwill was based on historical performance in the irish economy  but later quarters in indicated a significant reversal of gains seen in the first quarter of as of october   the fair value of our other reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values 
the fair value of our liquid feed supplements segment reporting unit exceeded its carrying value with coverage of coverage of equals to 
the fair values of five of our bulk liquid storage reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values with coverage less than and the average amount of goodwill allocated to each was million 
all other reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values with coverages greater than 
as of october   the amount of goodwill allocated to our liquid feed supplements reporting unit was million and the amount of goodwill allocated to our bulk liquid storage segment business as a whole was million 
key assumptions that drive the fair value of our reporting units include projected revenue and expense growth rates  discount rates  and weighted average cost of capital 
potential events and circumstances that could negatively affect these assumptions  and adversely affect the fair values  are discussed at length in the risk factors section  item a of this form k 
property  plant equipment when purchased  the values of our property  plant equipment are recorded initially at historical cost 
however  when an item is acquired as part of the acquisition of a business including the business combination on may   as has been the case for most of our property  plant equipment  its value is initially recorded according to its estimated fair value 
this value reflects management s assumptions about the assumptions that would be made by market participants if they were to buy or sell each identified asset on an individual basis 
once an item is initially recorded  however purchased  it is later depreciated using the straight line method over its estimated useful life  subject to adjustments due to economic or functional obsolescence 
the major portion of our property  plant equipment consists of storage tanks that were purchased as part of the business combination or an acquisition 
we estimated the fair value of each such tank by estimating the cost to construct or buy a similar asset of equivalent utility at current prices 
in order to establish a depreciation schedule  we also estimated the remaining useful lives of the storage tanks 
the estimation of useful lives of such length is inherently uncertain  difficult  and imprecise 
factors such as changes in competition  regulation  or environmental matters may cause us to change our estimates 
changes in the estimated useful lives of the property  plant and equipment could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
us gaap requires write downs to be recorded on property  plant equipment used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the assets carrying amount 
in assessing potential impairment  we consider the operating performance and projected undiscounted cash flows of the relevant assets 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows are estimated to be less than the assets carrying value  we have to record impairment charges equal to the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the assets 
our assessment of property  plant equipment impairment did not result in any write downs 

table of contents income taxes we record deferred tax assets or liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities using currently enacted rates and laws that we assume will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse in the future 
due to changing tax laws and different rates of tax in the many us states and foreign jurisdictions where we operate  significant judgment is required to estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to these differences 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carryforward periods available for tax reporting purposes and other relevant factors 
we comply with accounting standards that prescribe a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
results of operations actual results compared to pro forma results the actual results of operations of the company for do not provide a very meaningful basis for comparison since we were only an operating company for days during through may   our efforts were limited to organizational activities  activities relating to the initial public offering  activities relating to identifying and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates  activities relating to negotiating and consummating the acquisition  and activities relating to general corporate matters  we neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue  other than interest income earned on the proceeds of the initial public offering 
to provide readers with a more meaningful set of figures against which to compare our actual results for  we have presented pro forma results of operations of the company for  as if the company and the acquired business were combined as of january   and compared them with the actual results of operations of the company for we derived the unaudited pro forma results of operations from the unaudited consolidated financial statements of the acquired business from january  to may  and from the audited consolidated statements of the company from may  to december   and then made certain adjustments 
the pro forma results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results of operations that may have actually occurred had the business combination taken place on january   or the future financial position or operating results of the company 
the pro forma adjustments are based upon available information and assumptions that we believe are reasonable 
the presentation of the adjusted pro forma results is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the actual historical financial information prepared and presented in accordance with us gaap 
the pro forma results of operations do not include business combination expenses of million that were incurred the pro forma adjustments include an additional imputed interest expense of million for the year ended december  relating to the period from january  through may   based on historical borrowings and average interest rates of the acquired business  since before the business combination the ed f man group s debt and interest and other financing related costs were not specifically identified as corporate borrowings from the ed f man group 
the pro forma adjustments for include assumed corporate public company costs of million within general and administrative expenses associated with operating as a public company from january  through may   comparable in amount to the actual corporate public company costs incurred during after the business combination 
the pro forma results include an adjustment that assumes a full year of dividends payable on  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  including escrowed shares  at per share per quarter for the pro forma numbers include an adjustment to increase depreciation expense for pro forma information in the amount of 
table of contents million 
this adjustment was made as a result of the company finalizing the purchase price allocation of the acquired bulk liquid storage and liquid feed supplements businesses during and represents the updated useful life depreciation expense attributable to the period from january  to december  on assets existing at the acquisition date 
the pro forma results of operations do not include  of formation and operating costs associated with shermen or interest income from the trust account held by shermen of  for the pro forma results include the operating results of the southside river rail terminal acquisition on october   as well as amortization of debt issuance costs incurred as a result of the syndicated bank credit facility entered into on november   along with additional facility fees related to this new facility 
in addition to providing a more meaningful basis for comparison  the pro forma information is also useful because it provides investors with information about the continuing impact of the business combination on may  by showing how it might have affected our historical financial statements if the business combination had been consummated on january  instead 
the pro forma information should assist investors in analyzing our future prospects because it illustrates the possible scope of the change in our historical financial position and results of operations caused by the business combination

table of contents the following is a discussion of actual operating results for the year ended december   compared to the pro forma operating results for the year ended december  net revenue year ended december  in thousands actual pro forma change net revenue total net revenue  including transactions between us and the ed f man group  decreased million  or  to million for when compared to million for bulk liquid storage in the bulk liquid storage business  net revenue increased by million  or  to million for from million for  reflecting our expansion in this business 
we added additional capacity through the acquisition of our cincinnati  oh facility in october  completion of construction of our grays harbor  wa facility in december  expansion of our houston  tx facility during the second half of and in the fourth quarter of  and the expansion of our port allen  la facility during the first half of the net revenue increase was primarily due to a full year of operating our grays harbor  wa and cincinnati  oh facilities which increased our volume  as well as standard increases in our storage contract prices based on consumer price index adjustments 
bulk liquid storage revenue from outside of the united states  which accounted for of total bulk liquid storage revenue for  stayed consistent compared to  as a result of increased throughput that was offset by slightly lower exchange rates for the euro and pound sterling compared to our total capacity net of disposed capacity increased by the end of to approximately million gallons from approximately million gallons at the end of percentage capacity utilization of our bulk liquid storage facilities increased to at the end of the from at the end of we believe that capacity and capacity utilization are key to the profitability of our bulk liquid storage business 
once the high fixed cost of constructing a terminal has been incurred  the marginal cost of providing each additional increment of storage services is much less than the marginal revenues received from such services 
once current capacity is utilized  additional tanks may be built on available land to further leverage the property we already possess 
additionally  we may grow profitability by identifying new strategic locations and either acquiring existing bulk liquid terminals or constructing new bulk liquid terminals 
we continue to evaluate opportunities to increase our bulk liquid storage capacity while maintaining our high utilization rate  including possible projects for greenfield expansions and target infill development planned for the future 
additionally  we are evaluating global expansion opportunities through acquisitions consistent with our criteria for investment 
the trend demonstrated thus far in and of increased bulk liquid storage revenue may continue into the future  depending on our successful execution and completion of expansion and acquisition projects 
liquid feed supplements for net revenue for the liquid feed supplements business was million  which was a decrease of million  or  compared to net revenue of million for volume for stayed consistent with volume for at million tons 
the decrease in net revenue was primarily due to our lower sales prices  which were accompanied by a decrease in raw material prices 
this decrease in our sales price was a consequence of several factors liquid feed supplement products being marginally less competitive in the first and second quarter of compared to dry feed products  the continued decline in total cattle numbers  and competitive conditions 

table of contents we view volume  selling price  product mix  and gross profit margin percentage as key performance indicators to the profitability of our liquid feed supplements business 
once the fixed costs of an operating facility are covered  all revenue that exceeds the variable costs contributes to the profitability of our business 
generally  revenues are considered an incomplete indicator of performance because large fluctuations can occur from period to period due to volatility in the underlying commodity ingredient prices  which affect both competitive sales pricing and the cost of sales  as well as due to general seasonal trends 
thus far  the trend in and for the liquid feed supplement business has been a decline in both net revenue and the cost of ingredients 
the decline in our net revenue has been somewhat greater than the decline in the cost of ingredients  mainly due to pricing differences in the purchasing of ingredient inputs  which has negatively affected our margins 
margins may improve in the future as our products become more competitive to other commodities  assuming that these inputs continue their current trend of price escalation  making molasses based products more attractive than dry based feed products 
cost of sales year ended december  in thousands actual pro forma change cost of sales gross profit margin for  cost of sales for our liquid feed supplements business  including related party purchases from the ed f man group  was million  which was a decrease of million  or  compared to cost of sales of million for the decrease was mainly due to a decrease in purchased raw material prices 
gross profit margin net revenue less cost of sales in our liquid feed supplements business decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for this decrease resulted from various competitive pressures  including a decline in the size of the us cattle herd which affected the purchases of feed supplements 
gross profit margin percentage net revenues minus cost of sales  divided by net revenues for the liquid feed supplement business increased slightly from for to for due to effective implementation of marketing initiatives and improvement in our industrial sales initiatives 
we believe that gross profit margin is a key performance indicator to the profitability of our liquid feed supplements business 
this highly visible indicator provides us with measurable guidelines to monitor our cost of goods  which in the liquid feed supplements business can be somewhat volatile 
other operating costs and expenses year ended december  in thousands actual pro forma change other operating costs and expenses other operating costs and expenses of million increased by million  or  for from million for  principally as a result of operating our new cincinnati and grays harbor bulk liquid storage facilities 
major components of other operating costs and expenses included payroll  repairs  utilities  and insurance 

table of contents depreciation and amortization year ended december  in thousands actual pro forma change depreciation depreciation and amortization costs increased by million  or  to million for from million for the increase was mainly due to our recent capital investments in the united states  including the addition of our cincinnati and grays harbor facilities  as well as our expansion in houston and port allen 
selling  general  and administrative expenses year ended december  in thousands actual pro forma change selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses for increased by million  or  to million  compared to million for  primarily as a result of increased legal  advisory  and other professional fees  specifically relating to one time costs associated with our public warrant tender  founder warrant amendment  two stock registrations  and other transactions that did not occur in the increase was also partially due to moderate increases in personnel related costs since goodwill impairment year ended december  in thousands actual pro forma change goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment 
it was determined that goodwill impairment existed at our ireland facility  one of our reporting units 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge to goodwill of million which extinguished the entire amount of goodwill at this reporting unit 
the impairment was primarily due to a decline in the irish economy and the consequent reduction in our future revenue projection for the facility 
no other goodwill adjustments were necessary for our other reporting units in founder warrant expense year ended december  in thousands actual pro forma change founder warrant expense during  our shareholders approved the founder warrant amendment which extended the expiration dates of  and otherwise amended  the outstanding founder warrants 
as a result  the company recognized a

the founder warrant amendment was also recorded as an increase in stockholders equity specifically  as additional paid in capital equal to the increase in fair value of million 
operating income year ended december  in thousands actual pro forma change operating income operating income decreased by million  or  to million for from million for this decrease was partly the result of increased depreciation  selling  general and administrative expenses  and other operating costs and expenses  as well as lower liquid feed supplement gross profit margin during the decrease was also due to a one time founder warrant expense of million and a million goodwill impairment during this was partially offset by increased revenues derived from expanded bulk liquid storage capacity during interest expense  net year ended december  in thousands actual pro forma change interest expense  net interest expense  net of interest income  was million for  an increase of million  or  from million for the increase in interest expense was driven by higher borrowings due to capital projects and slightly higher interest rates  along with additional facility financing fees and debt amortization costs associated with the new bank syndicate credit facility beginning in november income taxes year ended december  in thousands actual pro forma change income tax provision our consolidated income tax provision of million for decreased by million  or  from million for the change was due to the impact of lower operating results and our ability to apply tax benefits to our increased corporate segment costs at our highest rate during the change in our effective tax rate from for to for was mainly due to goodwill impairment charges in that were not deductible for tax purposes

goodwill impairment during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual goodwill impairment assessment 
it was determined that goodwill impairment existed at our ireland facility  one of our reporting units 
as a result  we recorded a non cash impairment charge to goodwill of million which extinguished the entire amount of goodwill at this reporting unit 
the impairment was primarily due to a decline in the irish economy and the consequent reduction in our future revenue projection for the facility 
no other goodwill adjustments were necessary for our other reporting units 
there was no goodwill impairment for founder warrant expenses during  our shareholders approved the founder warrant amendment which extended the expiration dates of  and otherwise amended  the outstanding founder warrants

total trade accounts payable  including amounts due to related parties  decreased to million at december  from million at december   due primarily to payments made during owed to the ed f man group  mainly for molasses purchases 
sources our capital requirements have generally been financed primarily with cash flows from operations supplemented by borrowings from our credit facilities 
at december   we had million of borrowing capacity available under our million bank revolving credit facility

our external sources of liquidity include our bank revolving credit facility 
our available sources of liquidity include the balance still available to be drawn down under the credit facility 
the credit facility was increased on november   by another million pursuant to its accordion feature  whereby the available credit under the facility was expanded 
uses during we used cash to fund ongoing operations  including paying for purchases of raw materials  leases of land and equipment  and payroll  to fund capital expenditures for maintenance  expansions  and acquisitions  and to pay debt service and taxes 
trends the cash flows from operations of the bulk liquid storage and liquid feed supplements businesses  both while owned by the ed f man group and after we acquired them on may   have been positive for each month fiscal year for the last years 
we expect cash flows from operations to be positive for the next twelve months as a whole 
we also note that the capital expenditures of our two businesses for expansion and acquisitions are likely to increase  consistent with our growth strategy 
our businesses have not been severely affected by the global recession  although it appears to have reduced some of our customers demand for our products and services 
recent order activity has been relatively stable 

table of contents historical cash flows our cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities  as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flow  are summarized in the following table fiscal year ended december  fiscal year ended december  predecessor november  through may  cash provided by operating activities cash used in investing activities cash provided by used in financing activities year ended december  includes only days of acquired business operations 
operating activities consolidated cash provided by operating activities mainly comprises the cash from operations of our bulk liquid storage and liquid feed supplements businesses  partially offset by expenses paid at the corporate level  such as professional fees and interest on amounts borrowed on our credit facility 
our cash flow provided by operating activities during was million  an increase of million compared to million net cash provided by operations for this increase in operating cash flow is largely due to the company operating for a full year in compared to only days of acquired business operations in  which included million of business combination expenses 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in working capital for driven by significant payments to the ed f man group for related party payables outstanding  mainly for molasses purchases  and also partially offset by payments relating to employee bonuses 
cash provided by operating activities was generated primarily from bulk liquid storage rentals  volume fees  and ancillary service fees and sales of liquid feed supplements 
cash was used in operating activities mainly for costs of raw materials such as molasses  maintenance expenses  payroll costs  utilities  professional services  interest  and taxes 
investing activities our investing activities resulted in net cash used of million for  compared to net cash used of million for the change is primarily due to the release of million in cash held in our trust account at the closing of the business combination on may   partially offset by million paid as consideration for the acquired businesses 
net cash of million and million for and respectively  was used for capital expenditures  primarily in our bulk liquid storage segment in the united states

we spent million of maintenance capital expenditures on equipment in as well 
financing activities our financing activities resulted in net cash used of million for  compared to cash provided of million for the difference between the periods is primarily due to the payment of million upon redemption of  shares of common stock  the repurchase of  class a common stock for million  and a special cash dividend of per share on class a common stock totaling million  all during the first nine months cumulative proceeds received from period borrowings under our credit facility were million for compared to million for this difference was due to additional proceeds needed at the consummation of the business combination on may  the proceeds of the credit facility are used by the company for general corporate purposes  which includes among other things working capital  capital expenditures  and acquisitions

effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents during  the effect of exchange rate changes decreased our cash and cash equivalents by  primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and pound sterling during during  the effect of exchange rate changes increased our cash and cash equivalents by  primarily due to the weakening of the us dollar against the euro and pound sterling during bank syndicate credit facility in november  the company entered into a new three year  million revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks scheduled to terminate on november   while paying off in its entirety and terminating a temporary million credit facility with ed f man 
up to million of the current bank credit facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit 
we may also make short term borrowings of up to million under a swingline facility 
we initially drew down million under the bank credit facility in november  primarily to pay off our prior credit facility with ed f man treasury 
in november  the company exercised the accordion feature of the credit facility  with the unanimous consent of the banks committing additional funds  increasing the total lender commitment under the facility by million  to a total of million 
as of december   the total balance outstanding on the bank credit facility was million 
the interest rate for each loan is  at our option  either a libor  adjusted by the statutory reserve rate  plus per year  or b per year plus the highest of i jp morgan chase s public prime rate  ii the federal funds effective rate plus  and iii the one month libor adjusted by the statutory reserve rate plus 
we must pay a commitment fee of per year on the average daily unused amount of the credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is secured by a guarantees by all of our domestic wholly owned subsidiaries one

events of default include  among other things  covenant violations  events having a material adverse effect  and change of control specially defined 
based on our december  financial position and the current market conditions for our products and services  we anticipate that we will be able to comply with our covenants through ed f man credit facility to facilitate the consummation of the business combination on may   ed f man treasury  an ed f man affiliate  provided us with a two year  million revolving credit facility that would have matured on may   and a million working capital borrowing line that was scheduled to mature on january  we initially drew down million under this facility in may in october  we drew down an additional million under this facility to finance our purchase of the southside river terminal facility 
interest accrued on amounts borrowed under the facility at libor plus 
this revolving credit facility was paid off in full and terminated in november when we entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of banks led by jp morgan chase 
future cash flows this section consists almost entirely of forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the statements in this section include changes in the expected profitability of one or both of our businesses  changes in the amount or timing of our expected investments  or changes in the amount or timing of our expected draws under our credit facilities 
capital expenditures at december   we had outstanding contracts with third parties reflecting long term commitments for capital expenditures not yet incurred totaling million in the aggregate 
for  based on our current exchange rate expectation  we budgeted approximately million of capital expenditures  including approximately million for maintenance capital expenditures and million for expansion capital expenditures  although we continue to evaluate our capital budget and may make changes as economic conditions warrant 
maintenance capital expenditures include the refurbishment of storage tanks  piping  and dock facilities  and environmental capital expenditures  principally for improvements in containment measures 

table of contents currently  we are in the process of expanding the capacity of several of our terminal sites 
at our amsterdam  netherlands terminal  nine stainless steel tanks totaling approximately million gallons of capacity in the aggregate are under construction  which has been delayed due to the extensive permitting process in the netherlands 
at our houston  texas terminal we began construction of eight tanks totaling approximately million gallons of capacity in the aggregate 
also at our houston  texas terminal we are constructing four tanks totaling million gallons in the aggregate 
completion of these projects are on schedule and expected in the latter half of other uses in the future  we expect to use cash for various purposes in addition to capital expenditures  including payment of operating expenses  interest payments  tax payments  and discretionary debt principal payments 
as part of our operating expenses  we expect to continue to make significant purchases of raw materials for our liquid feed supplements business 
we and the ed f man group have a long term molasses supply agreement  pursuant to which the ed f man group is expected to continue to be our primary supplier of cane molasses 
the initial term of the agreement is for a period of years  beginning may   after which the agreement provides for automatic renewals for successive one year periods unless either party gives notice of non renewal 
also in  we entered into an addendum to our molasses supply agreement with the ed f man group to provide us with a more favorable supply and pricing through september also as part of operating expenses  we expect to continue to make significant lease payments 
we have long term operating leases on bulk liquid storage facilities and liquid feed supplements processing and distribution facilities 
typically our leases extend beyond five years 
any liquidity in excess of our operating expenses and planned capital expenditures is expected to be utilized to repay part of our credit facility or to finance the implementation of our growth strategy  which at this time is principally focused on expanding our bulk liquid storage business 
sources we expect our principal sources of liquidity in to be our cash from operations and our credit facility  as to which the available borrowing capacity on december  was million 
we are not predicting any material changes in the mix or relative cost of our capital resources in from december  we expect our cash flow from operating activities to be positive for as a whole 
as cash flow from operations is a key source of liquidity for us  further decreases in demand for our products or services would reduce the availability of funds  especially any further decrease in demand for bulk liquid storage services by the ed f man group  our largest customer 
we expect that our operating expenses  maintenance capital expenditures  interest payments  and tax payments will generally be funded by cash from operating activities 
we believe cash generated from operations  combined with our availability to draw on our current credit facility  will be sufficient to fund our expansion and acquisition capital expenditures in our expansion and acquisition capital expenditures can generally be accelerated or scaled back depending on our liquidity 
we expect that our debt principal payments will generally be funded by refinancing as such principal payments come due 
our credit facility includes covenants that materially limit our ability to undertake other debt financing 
we believe that the recent rise of the stock market in the latter half of could provide an ability for us to use stock as consideration in acquisitions and may raise the possibility of our issuing additional shares of our class a common stock to raise additional capital depending on the market price and liquidity of our common stock at the time 

table of contents any liquidity in excess of our operating expenses and planned capital expenditures is expected to be utilized to repay part of our credit facility or to finance the implementation of our growth strategy 
short term adequacy we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  credit facility  and the cash flow expected to be generated from operating activities will provide us with sufficient liquidity to satisfy our working capital needs  fund planned capital expenditures  and to meet our commitments through at least the next months 
cash generated from operating activities can fluctuate depending on global economic conditions 
if the availability of credit is tightened due to economic conditions  this could affect the demand of some of our customers for our products and services 
nonetheless  we expect to have sufficient access to cash to complete our committed expansion projects in long term adequacy beyond  we expect to have the ability to generate sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet our future cash requirements  including our debt obligations  for the reasonably foreseeable future 
we base our assessment of the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources on the following assumptions our businesses should continue to generate sufficient operating cash flow on an annual basis  the ongoing maintenance capital expenditures associated with our businesses should be readily funded from their annual operating cash flow or available financing  and we expect be able to refinance or extend maturing debt on appropriate terms that can be supported by the performance of our businesses 
we believe that our financing arrangements provide us with sufficient financial flexibility to fund our operations  debt service requirements  and capital expenditure plans 
our ability to access additional debt or equity capital in the long term depends on the availability of capital markets  our operating and financial performance  and pricing on commercially reasonable terms 
from time to time  we review our long term financing and capital structure 
as a result of our review  we may periodically explore alternatives to our current capital structure and financing  including the issuance of additional equity or long term debt  refinancing our credit facility  and other restructurings or financings 
in addition  we may from time to time seek to repurchase a portion of our outstanding equity in open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  or otherwise  and we may also review our corporate dividend policy 
these matters  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  contractual restrictions  government regulations  bank covenants  and other factors 
the amount of these activities may be material and may involve significant amounts of cash and or financing availability 
off balance sheet arrangements in connection with our initial public offering of units in  we granted the representatives of the underwriters an option to purchase an aggregate of  units  with an option purchase price of per unit 
each unit consists of one share of common stock and two warrants 
the terms of the units subject to this option are similar to the units sold in our initial public offering and the exercise price for each warrant in the unit is per share 
this option to purchase units is now exercisable at any time  in whole or in part  and expires on may  with the exception of operating lease commitments described in note  commitments and contingencies  of our financial statements  we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents factors that affect financial performance the company s performance is affected by a number of factors that cause fluctuation in the results of operations and overall financial performance 
the most significant factors are described below 
bulk liquid storage in our bulk liquid storage business  we have long standing relationships with a range of customers  a number of which are significant both in overall market position and contribution to the company 
contracts are typically in excess of one year in length and provide a significant pipeline of future revenue  in respect of which both cost and revenue structures utilize inflationary pricing mechanisms 
although customer retention has historically been high  changes in the customer base can occur and could have an impact on profitability 
we have foreign currency exposure  which can have either favorable or unfavorable impact on our earnings from time to time  but the majority of our transactions are conducted and reported in us dollars 
refer to item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this form k for further discussion of foreign currency exchange risk 
wherever possible we endeavor to secure contractual commitments with third parties prior to construction in order to minimize the delay between construction of facilities and achievement of profitable levels of utilization 
results can be adversely affected when utilization rates are low 
our performance is linked to the underlying economic demand for access to the regional supply chain network and logistics infrastructure for delivering goods and services to the market 
our storage rates are driven by customer demand and the available bulk liquid storage capacity at each of our regional terminal locations 
fluctuations in commodity pricing and commodity imbalances can increase or reduce the market demand for storage 
demand for our services has remained consistent despite a slowdown in economic conditions due to our extensive regional network and the vital link we provide for the delivery of bulk liquid products to the downstream market 
liquid feed supplements our liquid feed supplements business provides a range of liquid feed supplements to customers both large and small across a wide range of regions within the united states  canada  and australia 
historically  customer relationships usually are long and  although particular sales are not generally contracted in excess of one month ahead of delivery  the relationships usually result in stable income streams 
even so  changes in the customer base do occur and do have an impact on our profitability 
the business can be significantly affected by the overall health of the cattle and dairy markets 
our performance is also affected by the underlying price of the agricultural by products utilized in the business 
the market prices of non liquid feed stocks that compete directly with the liquid feed supplements business are dependent on conditions affecting their supply overall  such as climatic conditions that drive crop yield  quality  and availability 
accordingly  conditions of good or poor supply affect the demand for liquid feed supplements and pricing in turn 
the liquid feed supplements business is potentially more affected by changes in the availability and quality of agricultural commodities because of its higher proportion of agricultural commodity costs to its total costs 
the liquid feed supplements business can be significantly affected by adverse weather conditions such as droughts  hard winters  and flooding 
moreover  the months of april through july are traditionally seasonal low months for our liquid feed supplements business 
the second quarter is historically weaker than the first quarter  and the fall and winter months are normally the strongest 

table of contents corporate borrowings under our corporate revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor or short term us market rates  at our option 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to interest rates  but we do review this matter on a periodic basis 
if market interest rates were to increase or decrease  there is a potential impact in our earnings 
refer to item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in this form k for further discussion of interest rate risk 
overall the company is subject to a number of risks that have the potential to influence the future profitability of both operating segments  as described below 
our businesses operate in environments that require strict adherence to environmental protection and health and safety regulation 
a significant event such as contamination  leakage  or other material damage has the potential to significantly harm our financial performance 
we believe that our compliance with each of these requirements is at or above the best practice requirements and that we have a strong track record in this regard 
price inflation that is not directly linked to agricultural commodities  such as consumer price inflation  can also affect the overall performance of the company  particularly as it is reflected in employee compensation  energy  maintenance and construction costs 
we do not consider the company to be unduly affected by this factor compared with our competitors or the industry at large 
finally  for additional information regarding important risks that may affect our business  financial condition  and operating results  see part i  item a  risk factors in this form k 
future application of accounting standards management does not believe that there are any accounting standards that have been issued  are required to be adopted by the company in the future  and are reasonably likely to have a material impact on the information reported in our future financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we are exposed to market risks  including interest rate  foreign currency  and commodity risks 
we neither hold nor issue financial instruments for trading purposes  and we have not entered into any derivative financial instrument transactions to manage or reduce market risk 
our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and commodity prices is to decrease the volatility of our earnings and cash flows affected by potential changes in underlying rates and prices 
we monitor these risks and manage such risks on specific transactions 
the risk management process primarily uses analytical techniques and sensitivity analysis 
adverse effects of potential changes in market risks to which we are exposed are discussed below 
the following discussion does not  however  consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes  such as a significant increase in interest rates 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
a limitation that may cause the sensitivity analyses discussed below not to reflect fully the net market risk of the company arises from assuming that hypothetical changes in market rates and prices move in the same direction within each risk category 
the resulting sensitivity analyses do not incorporate information regarding the sign and amount of co movements in prices or rates 
except for any historical facts  this item a consists of forward looking statements 
important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially include any significant actions the company may take in the future to manage its exposure to market risk  any entry by the company into a new credit facility on significantly different terms than the existing credit facility  and any substantial changes in the worldwide geographic distribution of our business 
interest rate risk the fair value of our cash and cash equivalents at december   approximated its carrying value due to the short term duration of the cash equivalent financial instruments 
our earnings are exposed to interest rate risk associated with borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest at a variable rate based on libor or short term us market rates  at our option 
we currently do not use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk  but we may in the future 
we continuously monitor our level of borrowings to evaluate our potential exposure to interest rate risk  including our assessment of the current and future economic environment 
at december   we had outstanding borrowings of approximately million under our revolving credit facility 
based on the outstanding balance of our variable interest rate debt at december  and  if both libor and short term us market interest rates were to increase or decrease by basis points  the potential annual decrease or increase  respectively  in our and pre tax earnings would be approximately  and  respectively  and in our after tax net earnings would be approximately  and  respectively 
we are assuming a constant outstanding principal balance under our revolving credit facility and a hypothetical shift in market interest rates in the indicated direction throughout and  respectively 
changes in our outstanding principal balance or other changes in interest rates would lead to different results 
foreign currency exchange rate risk our foreign operations represent approximately of our total bulk liquid storage and liquid feed supplements segments operating income and approximately of our asset base 
we maintain various operations in multiple foreign locations detailed in the table below 
these foreign operations generally incur local 
table of contents operating costs and generate revenues in currencies other than the us dollar 
these foreign currency revenues and expenses expose us to foreign currency risk and give rise to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
we do not presently hedge against the risks of foreign currency fluctuations 
in the event of significant fluctuations in foreign currencies  we may experience declines in revenue and adverse impacts on operating results and such changes could be material 
to manage foreign currency risk  we closely monitor the working capital requirements of our foreign operations  as well as movements in foreign exchange rates 
we are continuing to evaluate the possible future use of foreign currency hedging strategies where we deem appropriate 
the following table lists the foreign countries in which we do business and the functional currency of each functional currencies canada canadian dollar united kingdom british pound netherlands euro ireland euro denmark danish krone poland polish zloty korea korean won australia australian dollar we have identified the canadian dollar  the british pound  and the euro as the currencies with the most potential to impact our net earnings 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in all three of these foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  would have potentially increased or decreased  respectively  our annual pre tax earnings which are expressed in us dollars by approximately million and million respectively for the years ended december  and  and our after tax net earnings by approximately  and  respectively 
our accumulated other comprehensive income as presented in our consolidated statements of stockholders equity includes unrealized gains and losses from foreign currency translation 
the assets  liabilities and results of operations of certain of our foreign subsidiaries are measured using their functional currency  which is the currency of the foreign economic environment in which they operate 
upon consolidating these subsidiaries  their assets and liabilities are translated to us dollars at currency exchange rates as of the balance sheet date  their revenue and expenses are translated at the weighted average currency exchange rate for the applicable reporting period  and their stockholder s equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates during the applicable reporting periods 
gains or losses from translation of foreign subsidiaries are included in accumulated other comprehensive income 
translation adjustments potentially affecting balance sheet items and included in accumulated other comprehensive income for were million of unrealized losses primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar against the euro and pound sterling 
this exchange rate change negatively impacted the net assets used in our foreign operations and held in local currencies  resulting in a decrease in cumulative translation adjustments to a  unrealized gain as of december   compared to a million unrealized gain as of december  we do not presently hedge against the risks of foreign currency fluctuations but are continuing to evaluate the possible future use of foreign currency hedging strategies where we deem appropriate 
commodity price risk in the normal course of operations  our business is exposed to market risks arising from adverse changes in the prices of the commodities stored  consumed  and produced in our business 

table of contents bulk liquid storage we do not face significant risks relating directly to short term movements in commodity prices in our bulk liquid storage business  as we primarily store and or handle products for a fee and are not engaged in significant unmatched purchases and resale of commodity products 
liquid feed supplements the liquid feed supplements business is potentially more affected by changes in the prices of commodities because it directly consumes and produces for sale various agricultural commodities 
it has a high proportion of agricultural commodity costs to its total costs 
however  our liquid feed supplements business does not utilize many fixed price long term supply or purchase contracts  but mainly uses short term contracts or floating price long term contracts 
we believe we have adequate primary and secondary sources of supply for each of our key commodity ingredients and that  in periods of rising prices  we expect to recover a majority of the increased cost in the form of higher selling prices 
however  recoveries typically lag the effect of cost increases due to the nature of our markets 
typically greater than of our raw material inputs are purchased from markets that can be volatile and are not provided the protections of standard risk management tools 
many of these ingredients are purchased from the food industry corn  soybean  sugar milling  as well as from other industrial production 
as such  the ingredients purchased by us are by product streams ancillary to our suppliers main product stream and do not necessarily synchronize with the seasonality of our business 
this requires us to make future purchase and storage commitments based upon knowledge of our industry as well as the production and pricing of numerous other industries
