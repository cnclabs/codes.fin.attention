recent developments on february   we paid a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share on the company s convertible exchangeable preferred stock preferred stock 
the dividend was paid to the holders of record of the preferred stock as of the close business on january  on january   we opened enrollment of the seamless pivotal phase trial for our sapacitabine oral capsules as a front line treatment of elderly patients aged years or older with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia aml who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy under a special protocol assessment  or spa  reached with the us food drug administration  or fda 
corporate information our corporate headquarters are located at connell drive  suite  berkeley heights  new jersey   and our telephone number is this is also where our medical and regulatory functions are located 
our research facility is located in dundee  scotland which is also the center of our translational work and development programs 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of novel  mechanism targeted drugs to treat human cancers and other serious diseases 
we are focused on delivering leading edge therapeutic management of cancer patients based on a clinical development pipeline of novel drug candidates 
clinical programs our clinical development priorities are focused on orally available sapacitabine in the following indications aml in the elderly  myelodysplastic syndromes  or mds  and non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 

table of contents recent highlights of our sapacitabine clinical program are in january  we opened enrollment of the seamless pivotal phase trial as a front line treatment of elderly patients aged years or older with newly diagnosed aml who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy under an spa  reached with the fda  in december  we announced one year survival data for sapacitabine phase trial for older patients with mds refractory to the hypomethylating agents azacitidine and or decitabine at the american society of hematology ash annual meeting  in october  we published preclinical model data demonstrating sapacitabine works synergistically with histone deacetylase hdac inhibitors to induce tumor cell death in vitro and in vivo  in july  we announced that the fda granted orphan drug designation to our sapacitabine product candidate for the treatment of both aml and mds  and in june  we reported interim response data for the ongoing phase clinical trial of sapacitabine in older patients with mds at the american society of clinical oncology  or asco  meeting 
the planning  execution and results of our clinical programs are significant factors that can affect our operating and financial results 
advancing our additional research and development programs we have additional clinical programs in development awaiting further clinical data 
once data become available and are reviewed  we will determine the feasibility of pursuing further development and or partnering these assets  including sapacitabine in combination with seliciclib  seliciclib in nsclc and nasopharyngeal cancer or npc and cyc highlights of some recent developments related to our other research and development programs include in december  we announced topline data from the appraise  phase b  randomized discontinuation  double blinded  placebo controlled study of oral seliciclib capsules as a third line or later treatment in patients with nsclc showing no difference in median progression free survival pfs between the seliciclib and placebo arms versus days respectively  but an increase in median overall survival os favoring seliciclib over placebo versus days  in december  preclinical data from a cyclacel collaboration was presented at the ash annual meeting demonstrating that cyc is cytotoxic at sub micromolar concentrations against myeloma cell lines and cd myeloma cells derived from patients 
cyc demonstrated antiproliferative activity even in the presence of the growth stimulatory effects of both cytokines and bone marrow stromal cells 
cyc induced apoptosis in myeloma cells as evidenced by the appearance of cleaved parp  in april  preclinical data from a cyclacel collaboration was presented at the annual meeting of the american association of cancer research aacr introducing cyc  cyclacel s oral cdk inhibitor  which has the same target profile as seliciclib  and showing that cyc induced apoptosis in her positive breast cancer cell lines refractory to trastuzumab herceptin 
cyc was also shown in preclinical studies to have anticancer activity in aml cell lines  including those with human mixed lineage leukemia mll rearrangements  and chronic lymphocytic leukemia cll cells  in february  a peer reviewed journal article demonstrated that seliciclib reversed resistance to the aromatase inhibitor letrozole femara and inhibited growth of hormone receptor positive breast cancer cells that had become insensitive to the effects of letrozole  and in january  a peer reviewed journal article demonstrated that seliciclib was effective against lung cancer cell lines and  in particular  those with activating mutations in k ras and n ras proteins 

table of contents our pipeline and expertise in cell cycle biology our core area of expertise is in cell cycle biology and we focus primarily on the development of orally available anticancer agents that target the cell cycle with the aim of slowing the progression or shrinking the size of tumors  and enhancing the quality of life and improving survival rates of cancer patients 
we are generating several families of anticancer drug candidates that act on the cell cycle including nucleoside analogues  cyclin dependent kinase  or cdk inhibitors and aurora kinase vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  or ak vegfr inhibitors 
although a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are currently attempting to develop nucleoside analogues  cdk inhibitor and ak inhibitor drugs  we believe that our drug candidates are differentiated in that they are orally available and interact with unique target profiles and mechanisms 
for example we believe that our sapacitabine is the only orally available nucleoside analogue to be tested in a phase trial for aml and in a phase trial in mds and seliciclib is the most advanced orally available cdk inhibitor in phase trials 
we have retained rights to commercialize our clinical development candidates and our business strategy is to enter into selective partnership arrangements with these programs 
commercial products we market directly in the united states xclair cream for radiation dermatitis and numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges for xerostomia 
all three products are approved in the united states under fda k or medical device registrations 
as described below under results of operations  for the three years ended december   and  we recognized product revenue totaling million  million and million  respectively 
general from our inception in through december   we have devoted substantially all our efforts and resources to our research and development activities 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
as of december  our accumulated deficit during the development stage was approximately million 
we expect to continue incurring substantial losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our clinical and preclinical drug candidates 
our operating expenses comprise research and development expenses and selling and general and administrative expenses 
to date  we have not generated significant product revenue but have financed our operations and internal growth through public offerings  private placements  licensing revenue  interest on investments  government grants and research and development tax credits 
prior to october  our revenue consisted of collaboration and grant revenue 
beginning in  we recognized revenue from sales of commercial products  for the first time  following the align acquisition in october we have recognized revenues from inception through december  totaling approximately million of which approximately million is derived from product sales  approximately million from fees under collaborative agreements and approximately million of grant revenue from various government grant awards 
although our resources are primarily directed towards advancing our anticancer drug candidate sapacitabine through in house development activities we are also progressing  but with significantly lower levels of investment  our other novel drug series which are at earlier stages 
taken together  our pipeline covers all four phases of the cell cycle  which we believe will improve the chances of successfully developing and commercializing novel drugs that work on their own or in combination with approved conventional chemotherapies or with other targeted drugs to treat human cancers 
as a consequence of our continued focus on sapacitabine clinical development and related cost reduction program  research and development expenditures for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  research and development expenditures for the year ended december  were reduced by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december

five common solid cancer types non small cell lung  breast  ovarian  prostate and colorectal cancers  represent over of all new cases of cancer in the united states each year and account for more than of all cancer deaths in the united states 
acute myeloid leukemia is one of the most common types of leukemia or cancer in the blood and bone marrow 
according to the american cancer society approximately  cases of leukemia are diagnosed annually in the united states of which about  are classified as aml 
leukemia is a deadly disease with an estimated  deaths annually in the united states  almost all in adults 
the average age of a patient with aml is and about two thirds of aml patients are above years old 
the prognosis of aml in the elderly is poor 

table of contents the american cancer society estimates that approximately  to  new cases of myelodysplastic syndromes are diagnosed annually in the united sates 
patients currently receive hypomethylating agents as first line treatment 
there is no approved therapy for second line treatment 
lung cancer is a cancer starting in the lungs that often takes many years to develop 
about to of all lung cancers are non small cell or nsclc type 
according to the american cancer society  an estimated  patients are diagnosed annually with nsclc in the united states 
an estimated  new cases are diagnosed annually in the european union 
nsclc is a deadly disease with an estimated  deaths annually in the united states 
npc develops in the nasopharynx  an area in the back of the nose toward the base of the skull 
although it is sometimes considered a head and neck or an oral cancer  nasopharyngeal cancer is different from these cancers 
it is frequently fatal  once the disease recurs after initial chemotherapy and radiotherapy  spreads widely and has different risk factors such as epstein barr virus  or ebv infection 
high ebv viral titers are considered an indicator of poor prognosis 
according to the american cancer society  an estimated  patients are diagnosed annually with nasopharyngeal cancer in the united states 
an estimated  are diagnosed annually in the european union  but an estimated  new cases are diagnosed annually in the asia pacific region 
lymphoma is a cancer of lymphoid tissue  a part of the lymphatic system 
lymphoid tissue is formed by several types of immune system cells that work together mainly to resist infections 
about of all lymphomas start in the skin often staying there without spreading to internal organs and are called cutaneous lymphomas 
the main cell types found in lymphoid tissue are b lymphocytes and t lymphocytes resulting in b cell or t cell lymphoma  or ctcl 
ctcl causes disfiguring skin lesions and severe itching 
according to the american cancer society  an estimated  patients are diagnosed annually with lymphoma in the skin in the united states 
oncology development programs we are generating several families of anticancer drugs that act on the cell cycle  including nucleoside analogues  cyclin dependent kinase  or cdk  inhibitors and aurora kinase vascular endothelial growth factor receptor  or ak vegfr inhibitors 
although a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are currently attempting to develop nucleoside analogues  cdk inhibitor  ak and or vegfr inhibitor drugs  we believe that our drug candidates  are differentiated in that they are orally available and interact with unique target profiles and mechanisms 
for example  we believe that our sapacitabine is the only orally available nucleoside analogue presently being tested in phase trials in aml and in phase for mds  and seliciclib is the most advanced orally available cdk inhibitor currently in phase trials 
in our development programs  we have been an early adopter of biomarker analysis to help evaluate whether our drug candidates are having their intended effect through their assumed mechanisms at different doses and schedules 
biomarkers are proteins or other substances whose presence in the blood can serve as an indicator or marker of diseases 
biomarker data from early clinical trials may also enable us to design subsequent trials more efficiently and to monitor patient compliance with trial protocols 
we believe that in the longer term biomarkers may allow the selection of patients more likely to respond to its drugs for clinical trial and marketing purposes and increase the benefit to patients 
our approach to drug discovery and development has relied on proprietary genomic technology to identify gene targets  which are then progressed by means of structure based drug design techniques through to the development stage 
this approach is exemplified by our aurora kinase  or ak  and polo like kinase  or plk  inhibitor programs 
fundamentally  this approach to drug discovery and design aims to improve our ability to select promising drug targets in the early stages of the process so as to decrease compound attrition rates during the later  more expensive stages of drug development 
by devoting resources initially to this process  we were able to focus our efforts on targets that have a higher probability of yielding successful drug candidates through the utilization of an integrated suite of sophisticated discovery and design technologies by highly skilled personnel 
however  as a result of the reduction in our workforce in and our ability to identify  optimize and develop new targets has been significantly curtailed 

table of contents sapacitabine our lead candidate  sapacitabine  is an orally available prodrug of cndac  which is a novel nucleoside analog  or a compound with a structure similar to a nucleoside 
a prodrug is a compound that has a therapeutic effect after it is metabolized within the body 
cndac has a significantly longer residence time in the blood when it is produced in the body through metabolism of sapacitabine than when it is given directly 
sapacitabine acts through a dual mechanism whereby the compound interferes with dna synthesis and repair by causing single strand dna breaks and induces arrest of the cell division cycle at g m checkpoint 
a number of nucleoside drugs  such as gemcitabine  or gemzar  from eli lilly  and cytarabine  also known as ara c  a generic drug  are in wide use as conventional chemotherapies 
both sapacitabine and its major metabolite  cndac  have demonstrated potent anti tumor activity in both blood and solid tumors in preclinical studies 
in a liver metastatic mouse model  sapacitabine was shown to be superior to gemcitabine and fu  two widely used nucleoside analogs  in delaying the onset and growth of liver metastasis 
we have retained worldwide rights to commercialize sapacitabine  except for japan  for which daiichi sankyo co  ltd  or daiichi sankyo  has a right of first negotiation 
we are currently exploring sapacitabine in both hematological cancers and solid tumors 
to date  sapacitabine has been evaluated in approximately patients in several phase and studies and has shown signs of anti cancer activity 
in january  we opened enrollment of the seamless pivotal phase trial  which will evaluate sapacitabine oral capsules as a front line treatment in elderly patients aged years or older with newly diagnosed aml who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy 
the study will be conducted under an spa 
hematological cancers phase clinical trial in patients with advanced leukemias and myelodysplastic syndromes in december  at the ash annual meeting  we reported interim results from a phase clinical trial of oral sapacitabine in patients with advanced leukemias and mds 
the data demonstrated that sapacitabine had a favorable safety profile and promising anti leukemic activity in patients with relapsed and refractory aml and mds when administered by two different dosing schedules 
the primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose  or mtd  of sapacitabine administered twice daily for seven consecutive days every days or three consecutive days per week for two weeks every days 
the mtd was reached at mg on the seven day schedule and mg on the three day schedule 
dose limiting toxicity was gastrointestinal which included abdominal pain  diarrhea  small bowel obstruction and neutropenic colitis 
one patient treated at the mtd of mg on the seven day schedule died of complications from neutropenic colitis 
among patients  with aml and with mds  in this dose escalating study  the best responses were complete remission  or cr  or complete remission without platelet recovery  or crp  in six patients for an overall response rate of 
in addition  patients had a significant decrease in bone marrow blasts including seven with blast reduction to or less 
the study was conducted at the university of texas m

anderson cancer center and is led by hagop kantarjian  md  professor of medicine and chairman of the leukemia department and dr 
william plunkett  professor and chief  section of molecular and cellular oncology  department of experimental therapeutics 
phase randomized clinical trial in elderly patients with aml previously untreated or in first relapse in december  we initiated an open label  multicenter  randomized phase clinical trial of oral sapacitabine in elderly patients with aml aged or older who are previously untreated or in first relapse 
the phase study  led by dr 
kantarjian  has a primary endpoint of year survival rate of three dosing schedules of sapacitabine in elderly patients with previously untreated or first relapsed aml 
secondary objectives are to assess cr or crp  partial remission  or pr  duration of cr or crp  or major hematological improvement and their corresponding durations  transfusion requirements  number of hospitalized days and safety 
the study uses a selection design with the objective of identifying a dosing schedule among three different arms  a 
mg twice daily for seven days every weeks  b 
mg twice daily for seven days every weeks  and c 
mg twice daily for three days per week for two weeks every weeks  which produces a better year survival rate in the event that all three dosing schedules are active 
each arm enrolled and treated patients 
approximately of patients had aml de novo and the rest had aml preceded by antecedent hematological disorder  or ahd  such as mds  or myeloproliferative disease 
eighty percent of the patients were untreated and in first relapse 
we completed enrollment of aml patients in this study in october in december  at the st annual meeting of ash we reported year survival data 

table of contents the primary endpoint of year survival was on arm a  on arm c and on arm b 
the median overall survival was days on arm c range of to over days  days on arm a range of to over days and days on arm b range of to over days 
overall response rate  or orr  a secondary endpoint  was on arm a  on arm c and on arm b with cr rate of on arm c and on arms a and b 
thirty day mortality was on arm c and arm a and on arm b 
approximately of all patients received sapacitabine for at least cycles 
fifteen patients who survived one year or more received an average of treatment cycles 
exploratory subgroup analysis suggests that i arm c may be more effective for de novo aml and ii arm a may be more effective for aml preceded by ahd  such as mds 
the day dosing schedule in arm c was selected for further clinical development in elderly patients with de novo aml based on a year survival rate of  orr of with durable crs 
the day dosing schedule in arm a was selected for further clinical development in elderly patients with aml preceded by ahd based on a year survival rate of  orr of with durable hematological improvement 
randomized phase clinical trial in older patients with mds as a second line treatment in september  we advanced sapacitabine into phase development as a second line treatment in patients aged or older with mds who are previously treated with hypomethylating agents 
the mds stratum of the study is designed as a protocol amendment expanding the ongoing phase trial of sapacitabine in aml described above  to include a cohort of patients with mds 
patients with mds often progress to aml 
the primary objective of the mds stratum is to evaluate the year survival rate of three dosing schedules of sapacitabine 
secondary objectives are to assess the number of patients who have achieved cr or crp  pr  hematological improvement and their corresponding durations  transfusion requirements  number of hospitalization days and safety 
the study uses a selection design with the objective of identifying a dosing schedule which produces a better year survival rate for each stratum in the event that all three dosing schedules are active 
in december  at the ash annual meeting  we reported year survival data from a phase randomized trial of oral sapacitabine capsules  a novel nucleoside analogue  in older patients with mds refractory to hypomethylating agents  such as azacitidine and decitabine 
the study uses a selection design with the objective of identifying a dosing schedule that produces a better year survival rate in the event that all three dosing schedules are active 
the study enrolled patients aged or older with mds refractory to hypomethylating agents randomized across three dosing schedules of sapacitabine patients in arm a  a day low dose regimen mg bid  patients in arm b  a day high dose regimen mg bid and patients in arm c  a day high dose regimen mg bid approximately of patients were aged years or older and were scored as intermediate or high risk by ipss  the international prognostic scoring system 
baseline blast counts were between and in of the patients 
all patients were previously treated with hypomethylating agents with azacitidine  with decitabine and were double refractory patients as they were treated with both azacitidine and decitabine on arm a  on arm b and on arm c 
approximately were previously treated with lenalidomide in addition to hypomethylating agents 

table of contents the primary endpoint of year survival was achieved in of the patients on arm a  of the patients on arm b and of the patients on arm c 
the median overall survival was days on arm a range of to days  days on arm b range of to over days and days on arm c range of to over days 
overall response rate  a secondary endpoint consisting of the rate of cr  crp  pr  cri or hematological improvement  was for patients on arm a  for patients on arm b and for patients on arm c 
two patients achieved a cr both on arm a 
approximately of all patients received sapacitabine for to cycles and for or more cycles 
the mortality rate from all causes within thirty days of randomization was randomized phase pivotal trial  seamless  as a front line treatment in elderly patients aged years or older with newly diagnosed aml who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy on january   we opened enrollment of the seamless pivotal phase trial for the company s sapacitabine oral capsules as a front line treatment of elderly patients aged years or older with newly diagnosed aml who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy 
the study is being conducted under an spa agreement that cyclacel reached with the fda 
seamless builds on promising year survival observed in elderly patients aged years or older with newly diagnosed aml or aml in first relapse enrolled in a phase study of single agent sapacitabine 
the seamless study is chaired by hagop m 
kantarjian  md  chairman and professor  department of leukemia  the university of texas md anderson cancer center  houston  texas 
seamless is a multicenter  randomized  phase study comparing three treatment arms 
in arm a sapacitabine is administered in alternating cycles with decitabine  in arm b sapacitabine is administered alone and in arm c decitabine is administered alone 
the primary efficacy endpoint is overall survival 
the study is designed to demonstrate an improvement in overall survival of either of two pairwise comparisons arm a versus arm c or arm b versus arm c 
approximately patients per arm or a total of patients from approximately centers will be enrolled 
seamless will be monitored by a data safety monitoring board dsmb 
a prespecified interim analysis for futility will be performed and reviewed by the dsmb 
on september   we reached agreement with the fda regarding the spa  on the design of a pivotal phase trial  the seamless trial 
an spa provides trial sponsors with an fda agreement that the design and analysis of the trial adequately address objectives in support of a submission for a marketing application if the trial is performed according to the spa 
the spa may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the fda  or if the fda becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product efficacy or safety 
however  an spa does not provide any assurance that a marketing application would be approved by the fda 
furthermore  phase clinical trials are time consuming and expensive  and because we have limited resources  we may be required to collaborate with a third party or raise additional funds 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to do so 
solid tumors phase clinical trials in patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphomas two phase studies of sapacitabine were completed by daiichi sankyo  from which we in licensed sapacitabine  evaluating patients in refractory solid tumors 
in addition  we conducted a phase b dose escalation clinical trial in patients with refractory solid tumors or lymphomas 
preliminary results of the phase b study were reported at the eortc nci aacr molecular targets and cancer therapeutics meeting in november the primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety profile of sapacitabine administered twice daily for consecutive days or consecutive days every days 
of the treated patients  received the drug twice daily for days and received the drug twice daily for days 
the dose limiting toxicity was reversible myelosuppression 
one patient treated at the maximum tolerated dose died of candida sepsis in the setting of grade neutropenia and thrombocytopenia 
non hematological toxicities were mostly mild to moderate 
the best response by investigator assessment was stable disease in patients  five with non small cell lung cancer  two with breast cancer  two with ovarian cancer and one each with colorectal cancer  adenocarcinoma of unknown primary  gastrointestinal stromal tumor  and parotid acinar carcinoma 

table of contents phase clinical trial in patients with non small cell lung cancer in january  we began treating patients in a phase  open label  single arm  multicenter  clinical trial in patients with nsclc who have had one prior chemotherapy 
this study builds on the observation of prolonged stable disease of four months or longer experienced by heavily pretreated nsclc patients involved in two phase studies of sapacitabine 
the multicenter phase trial is led by philip d 
bonomi  md  at rush university medical center  chicago 
the primary objective of the study is to evaluate the rate of response and stable disease in patients with previously treated nsclc 
secondary objectives are to assess progression free survival  duration of response  duration of stable disease  year survival  overall survival and safety 
the study will enroll approximately patients and has a lead in phase for dose escalation with the objective of defining a recommended dose followed by a second stage in which patients will be treated at the recommended dose 
phase clinical trial in patients with cutaneous t cell lymphoma  or ctcl in april  we initiated a phase clinical trial in patients with advanced ctcl  a cancer of t lymphocytes  or white blood cells  which causes disfiguring skin lesions and severe itching 
the primary objective of the study is to evaluate tolerability and response rate of mg and mg regimens of sapacitabine both twice a day for three days per week for two weeks in a three week cycle in patients with progressive  recurrent  or persistent ctcl on or following two systemic therapies 
the study uses a selection design to choose an optimal dose if both are active 
secondary objectives are to assess response duration  time to response  time to progression and relief of pruritus or itching 
non hematological toxicities were mostly mild to moderate 
the best response by investigator assessment was partial response in patients out of enrolled 
we stopped the trial in order to re direct our resources to sapacitabine clinical trials with a higher priority 
orphan designation european union during may  we received designation from the european medicines evaluation agency  or emea  for sapacitabine as an orphan medicine in two separate indications aml and mds 
the emea s committee for orphan medicinal products  or comp  adopted a positive opinion on the company s application to designate sapacitabine as an orphan medicinal product for the indications of aml and mds 
the objective of european orphan medicines legislation is to stimulate research and development of medicinal products for rare diseases by providing incentives to industry 
an orphan designation in the european union confers a range of benefits to sponsor companies including market exclusivity for a period of years  emea scientific advice on protocol development  direct access to the centralized procedure for review of marketing authorizations  emea fee reductions and eligibility for grant support from european agencies 
united states in june  we announced that the fda granted orphan drug designation to our sapacitabine product candidate for the treatment of both aml and mds 
an orphan designation in the united states confers a range of benefits to sponsor companies  including market exclusivity for a period of seven years from the date of drug approval  the opportunity to apply for grant funding from the united states government to defray costs of clinical trial expenses  tax credits for clinical research expenses and a potential waiver of the fda s application user fee 
orphan status is granted by the fda to promote the development of new drug therapies for the treatment of diseases that affect fewer than  individuals in the united states 

table of contents seliciclib although our current clinical development priorities are focused on sapacitabine only  our second drug candidate  seliciclib  is a novel  first in class  orally available  cdk inhibitor 
the compound selectively inhibits a spectrum of enzyme targets cdk  cdk and cdk that are central to the process of cell division and cell cycle control 
the target profile of seliciclib is differentiated from the published target profile of other cdk inhibitors 
its selectivity is differentiated by recent publications by independent investigators which showed that seliciclib i is more active against nsclc cells with k ras or n ras mutations than those with wild type ras and ii overcomes resistance to letrozole femara in breast cancer cells caused by a particular form of cyclin e in complex with cdk preclinical studies have shown that the drug works by inducing cell apoptosis  or cell suicide  in multiple phases of the cell cycle 
to date  seliciclib has been evaluated in approximately patients in several phase and studies and has shown signs of anti cancer activity 
we have retained worldwide rights to commercialize seliciclib 
phase clinical trials in patients with refractory solid tumors we have completed two phase trials that enrolled healthy volunteers and three phase trials that enrolled a total of cancer patients testing different doses and schedules 
the primary toxicities observed were of a non hematological nature  including asthenia or weakness  elevation of liver enzymes  hypokalemia or decreased potassium levels  nausea and vomiting and elevation in creatinine 
although these trials were designed to test safety rather than efficacy of seliciclib given alone as monotherapy in patients with solid tumors who failed multiple previous treatments  several of these patients appeared to have benefited from seliciclib treatment 
seliciclib was shown in a further phase study sponsored and conducted by independent investigators to have clinical antitumor activity in patients with nasopharyngeal cancer  measured as a decrease in the size of primary tumor and involved lymph nodes  as well as an increase in tumor cell deaths by biomarker analyses 
phase clinical trials in patients with nsclc or breast cancer four phase trials have been conducted in cancer patients to evaluate the tolerability and antitumor activities of seliciclib alone or in combination with standard chemotherapies used in the treatment of advanced nsclc or breast cancer 
interim data from two phase open label studies of a total of patients with nsclc  suggest that seliciclib treatment did not aggravate the known toxicities of standard first and second line chemotherapies nor appear to cause unexpected toxicities  although these trials were not designed to provide statistically significant comparisons 
the combination of seliciclib with a standard dose of capecitabine xeloda was not well tolerated in patients with advanced breast cancer 
on december   we announced topline results from appraise  our phase b  randomized discontinuation  double blinded  placebo controlled  study of oral seliciclib capsules as a third line or later treatment in patients with nsclc 
topline results  after unblinding the treatment assignment among randomized patients  showed that there was no difference between the seliciclib and placebo arms in terms of progression free survival  or pfs  versus days respectively but an increase in median overall survival was observed favoring the seliciclib arm over the placebo arm versus days respectively 
a total of patients from centers in the united states were entered in the study after having progressed on at least two prior therapeutic regimens for their nsclc 
of these  were randomized  on seliciclib and on placebo 
forty five out of randomized patients received or more prior therapies and out of randomized patients previously received at least one egfr inhibitor drug on seliciclib and on placebo 
fourteen patients were crossed over to the seliciclib arm after their cancer progressed while they were receiving placebo 
study data demonstrated seliciclib to be safe at the administered dose 
there was no difference between the seliciclib and placebo arms in terms of pfs of days on the seliciclib arm versus days on the placebo arm 
however an increase in median overall survival was observed of days on the seliciclib arm versus days on the placebo arm 

table of contents appraise was a double blinded  randomized study of single agent seliciclib versus best supportive care in patients with nsclc treated with at least two prior systemic therapies 
appraise was led by chandra p 
belani  md at milton s 
hershey medical center  penn state university 
the study s main objective was to learn the anti tumor activity of seliciclib as a single agent in refractory nsclc and help determine further development strategies 
the study design was randomized discontinuation 
all patients received seliciclib at a dose of mg twice a day for three days for at least three cycles of two weeks each 
patients who achieved stable disease after three cycles were randomized to continue on seliciclib or receive placebo with best supportive care 
patients in the placebo arm who progressed were given the option to cross over and again receive seliciclib 
the primary efficacy endpoint of appraise was doubling progression free survival  or pfs  measured in the randomized portion of the study 
in august  we announced that an independent data review committee  or idrc  completed a review of the first interim analysis data from the study 
the idrc assessed the safety profile of seliciclib and recommended that the study continue after reviewing data from patients with previously treated nsclc  of whom proceeded into the blinded portion of the study and were randomized to receive either seliciclib or best supportive care 
based on the interim data  the idrc reached the following main conclusions there were no safety concerns that would warrant stopping the study  there was no trend favoring the seliciclib treatment arm  and as a definitive conclusion could not be reached because of the low number of events  it was recommended that the study be continued 
based on our cost versus benefit analysis  we decided not to enroll additional patients 
the appraise trial continued with the patients already enrolled until the last enrolled patient had completed follow up 
in accordance with the protocol  we remain blinded to the study data during the whole process 
phase clinical trials in patients with npc in november  we commenced a phase multicenter  international  blinded randomized study of oral seliciclib as a single agent in patients with npc 
the primary objective is to evaluate month progression free survival  or pfs  of two dosing schedules of seliciclib in approximately patients with previously treated npc 
secondary objectives are overall survival  response rate  response duration  safety and tolerability 
the first part of the study is designed to confirm safety and tolerability of mg twice a day for four days per week or mg once a day for four days per week of seliciclib 
it is open to approximately to patients with advanced solid tumors as well as patients with npc 
the second part of the study is designed to detect major differences between the two dosing schedules of seliciclib and a placebo group in terms of month pfs in approximately patients 
the start of the second part of the study is dependent on clinical data from the lead in phase and available resources 
in may  at the asco annual meeting  we reported interim data from the lead in portion of the phase study which demonstrated that oral seliciclib could be safely administered in two dosing schedules which were well tolerated and met the criteria for proceeding to the randomized stage of the study 
seliciclib treatment resulted in prolonged stable disease in of previously treated npc patients  including with stable disease lasting longer than months  suggesting seliciclib inhibits tumor growth in npc 
the data support further clinical development of oral seliciclib in npc 

table of contents cyc in june  we initiated a multicenter phase pharmacologic clinical trial of cyc  an orally available inhibitor of aurora kinase a and b and vegfr  in patients with advanced solid tumors 
the multicenter phase trial  now completed  is designed to examine the safety and tolerability of cyc in patients with advanced solid tumors 
the primary objective of the study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose 
secondary objectives are to evaluate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of the drug and document anti tumor activity 
aurora kinases  or ak  are a family of serine threonine protein kinases discovered by professor david glover  our chief scientist  which are only expressed in actively dividing cells and are crucial for the process of cell division or mitosis 
these proteins  which have been found to be over expressed in many types of cancer  have generated significant scientific and commercial interest as cancer drug targets 
vegfr is a receptor protein that plays a key regulatory role in the angiogenesis pathway  or blood vessel formation 
vegfr is targeted by recently approved drugs such as bevacizumab and sorafenib indicated for the treatment of several solid cancers  such as breast  colorectal  kidney  liver and lung 
we have retained worldwide rights to commercialize cyc further work on cyc will be undertaken when appropriate levels of resource are available to direct to the program 
cyc in december  at the ash conference  we announced the presentation of new preclinical data for cyc  a novel  orally available  cell cycle kinase inhibitor currently in ind directed development 
cyc and other compounds in a related series target the same key cdk cyclin complexes which are targeted by seliciclib 
cyc retains the specificity and mechanism of action of seliciclib  but has increased anti proliferative potency and improved pharmaceutical properties 
the data was presented by noopur raje  md  director of the center for multiple myeloma at massachusetts general hospital cancer center in boston and associate professor of medicine at harvard medical school 
dr 
raje and colleagues presented results of a study entitled  cyc  a potent derivative of seliciclib is active in multiple myeloma in preclinical studies 
the data demonstrate that cyc is cytotoxic at sub micromolar concentrations against myeloma cell lines and cd myeloma cells derived from patients 
cyc demonstrated antiproliferative activity even in the presence of the growth stimulatory effects of both cytokines and bone marrow stromal cells 
cyc induced apoptosis in myeloma cells as evidenced by the appearance of cleaved parp 
cyclacel discovered cyc and other novel cdk inhibitors in collaboration with the cancer research uk centre for cancer therapeutics at the institute of cancer research icr  london  uk 
other programs we have allocated limited resources to other programs allowing us to maintain and build on our core competency in cell cycle biology and related drug discovery 
in our second generation cdk inhibitor program  we have discovered several series of cdk inhibitors that we believe may prove to be more potent anticancer agents than seliciclib based on preclinical observations 
in our polo like kinase or plk inhibitor program we have discovered potent and selective small molecule inhibitors of plk  a kinase active during cell division  targeting the mitotic phase of the cell cycle 
plk was discovered by professor david glover  our chief scientist 
the company has a number of earlier stage programs for which limited or no resources will be allocated 
for example  extensive preclinical data published by independent investigators evidence activity by our cdk inhibitors  including seliciclib  in various autoimmune and inflammatory diseases and conditions associated with aberrant cell proliferation including glaucoma  graft versus host disease  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  lupus nephritis  polycystic kidney disease and rheumatoid arthritis 
in our gsk inhibitor program we have demonstrated evidence of activity in preclinical models of type diabetes 

table of contents where appropriate we intend to progress such programs through collaboration with groups that specialize in the particular disease area until such times that these programs can be partnered and or progressed should funding become available 
hdm inhibitors one of the key cell cycle regulatory proteins is p  a protein discovered by our founder  professor sir david lane 
when active  p causes cell arrest at the g s checkpoint  inducing apoptosis in cancer cells 
under normal circumstances  p is held in an inactive form by binding to another regulatory protein  hdm in this program  we have investigated ways of disrupting the interaction between hdm and p  thus activating p through virtual screening technologies  we have identified two small molecule classes capable of breaking the binding between p and hdm cyclin binding groove inhibitors the activity of cdk can be inhibited by various methods  such as by blocking the atp site  as is the case with seliciclib  or by inhibiting the substrate binding site on the associated cyclin protein 
preventing cyclin a from binding to its substrates results in cell cycle arrest and induces apoptosis in cancer cells 
this was the subject of a two year collaboration with astrazeneca that concluded in mid we have retained all intellectual property rights associated with this program 
non oncology programs cell cycle inhibitors in autoimmune inflammatory diseases preclinical results from several independent investigators suggest that cell cycle inhibitors such as seliciclib and its backup molecules arrest the progress of the cell cycle and may have therapeutic benefit in the treatment of patients with autoimmune and inflammatory diseases as well as in diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation 
published data indicate potential benefit in graft versus host disease  idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis  glomerulonephritis  lupus nephritis  polycystic kidney disease and rheumatoid arthritis 
cdk inhibitors in virology cell cycle inhibitors may be useful in the treatment of viral diseases to the extent that drugs can be developed that prevent the replication of virus in infected host cells while sparing most uninfected cells 
if this is proven in humans  cell cycle inhibitors may have significant potential in this area  as they do not rely on viral targets and are less likely to induce viral resistance  a major cause of failure of currently available antiviral drugs 
we have investigated a number of compounds in this program  some of which appear to reduce hiv levels in biological tests with antiviral potency equivalent to some existing hiv aids therapeutic agents 
we intend to progress this program through collaboration with groups that specialize in virology research 
gsk inhibitors in type diabetes inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase or gsk  downstream of insulin action  is an essential element in the body s regulation of blood sugar  and is a recognized target for the treatment of type diabetes 
gsk is a serine threonine protein kinase that is structurally very similar to cdk 
we have identified four chemical families of gsk inhibitors some of which are potent at picomolar concentrations which we believe are among the most potent gsk inhibitors disclosed in relevant research literature 
we have selected two lead compounds from the series  both of which have achieved proof of concept in the standard obese zucker rat model of diabetes  demonstrating stimulation of glycogen synthase  improvement in glucose tolerance and regulation of triglycerides 
we intend to progress this program through collaboration with groups that specialize in diabetes research 

table of contents commercial products we have exclusive rights to sell and distribute three products in the united states and canada used primarily to manage the effects of radiation or chemotherapy in cancer patients xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges 
all three products are approved in the united states under fda k or medical device registrations 
xclair cream xclair is an aqueous cream containing sodium hyaluronate  or hyaluronic acid  and glycyrrhetinic acid that is formulated to relieve symptoms associated with radiation dermatitis 
sodium hyaluronate is the key water regulating substance in human skin 
sodium hyaluronate has high viscoelasticity and lubricity 
when sodium hyaluronate solution is applied on the surface of skin  it forms an air permeable layer that keeps skin moist and smooth 
small molecular weight sodium hyaluronate can penetrate into the dermis where it combines with water to promote microcirculation  nutrient absorption  and metabolism 
glycyrrhetinic acid reduces inflammation and is believed to have immunomodulatory properties 
numoisyn liquid numoisyn liquid is an oral solution used to replace natural saliva when salivary glands are damaged 
the viscosity of numoisyn liquid is similar to that of natural saliva 
linseed extract in numoisyn liquid contains mucins that provide superior viscosity and reduced friction compared to water or carboxymethylcellulose or cmc solutions 
linseed extract significantly reduces the symptoms of dry mouth with increasing effect over time while numoisyn liquid is used 
numoisyn lozenges numoisyn lozenges dissolve slowly while moved around in the mouth 
they contain sorbitol and malic acid to stimulate normal salivation and provide temporary relief of dry mouth in patients who have some residual secretory function and taste perception 
numoisyn lozenges support saliva s natural protection of teeth so that teeth are not damaged with repeated use of the lozenges 
they are sugar free and buffered with calcium to protect teeth 
numoisyn lozenges have been demonstrated to be safe and effective for long term use and are well tolerated by patients 
use of numoisyn lozenges improves subjective symptoms of dry mouth and does not cause bacteria or plaque formation or loss of tooth enamel hardness 
business strategy in september  we announced a revision of our operating plan to concentrate our resources on the advancement of our lead drug sapacitabine 
consistent with the revised operating plan  during and  we reduced our workforce across all locations 
with the execution of the revised operating plan and continued cost containment efforts  we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  is sufficient to meet our anticipated short term working capital needs and to fund our on going sapacitabine clinical trials for the next twelve months 
however  we cannot be certain that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to complete the development and commercialize any of our product candidates currently in clinical development  should they succeed 

table of contents focus on the cell cycle and cancer our core area of expertise is in cell cycle biology and our scientists include recognized leaders in this field 
in addition  our senior management has extensive experience in research  preclinical and clinical development and sales and marketing 
thus  we believe that we are well placed to exploit the significant opportunities that this area offers for new drug discovery and development for the following reasons the novel  mechanism targeted cell cycle drugs we are developing are designed to be highly selective in comparison to conventional chemotherapies  potentially inducing death in cancer cells while sparing most normal cells which may give rise to fewer side effects 
we believe that our sapacitabine is the only orally available nucleoside analogue presently being tested in the phase trial in aml and phase trial in mds and seliciclib is the most advanced orally available cdk inhibitor currently in phase trials 
we believe that we are well positioned to realize some of the market potential of such drugs 
develop anticancer drug candidates in all phases of the cell cycle and multiple compounds for particular cell cycle targets targeting a broad development program focused on multiple phases of the cell cycle allows us to minimize risk while maximizing the potential for success and also to develop products that are complementary to one another 
enter into partnering arrangements selectively  while developing our own sales and marketing capability we currently retain virtually all marketing rights to the compounds associated with our current clinical stage drug programs 
to optimize our commercial return  we intend to enter into selected partnering arrangements  and to leverage our sales and marketing capability by retaining co promotion rights as appropriate 
historically  we have planned to develop compounds through the phase proof of efficacy stage before seeking a partner 
we may be prepared to enter into partnering arrangements earlier than phase proof of concept trials in connection with drug programs outside our core competency in oncology 
patents  proprietary technology and collaborations we consider intellectual property rights to be vital and use a variety of methods to secure  protect and evaluate these rights 
these include ownership and enforcement of patent rights  patent applications covering our own inventions in fields that we consider important to our business strategy  license agreements with third parties granting us rights to patents in fields that are important to our business strategy  invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants  non compete agreements with our key employees and consultants  confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  and others having access to our proprietary information  standard policies for the maintenance of laboratory notebooks to establish priority of our inventions  freedom to use studies from patent counsel  material transfer agreements  and trademark protection 
in addition to our united states patents  we own patents that were granted by the european patent office  or epo  for designated european countries  and issued patents in other countries 
the european granted patents expire between and in addition to the licenses we hold under the patents issued in the united states  we hold licenses under issued patents worldwide  seven granted by the epo for designated european countries and issued in other countries 
the licensed european granted patents expire between and our patent strategy is to file patents on compounds and technologies in countries and jurisdictions that we consider important to our business 
we usually file first in the united kingdom and then extend our applications to other countries through the patent cooperation treaty or pct 
in some cases  we file directly in the united states 

table of contents we give priority to obtaining substance of matter claims in the united states  the epo  japan and other important markets if such protection is available 
we prefer substance of matter claims because they give us rights to the compounds themselves  and not merely a particular use 
in addition to substance of matter claims  we seek coverage for solid state forms  polymorphic and crystalline forms  medical uses  combination therapies  specific regimens  pharmaceutical forms of our compounds and synthetic routes where available and appropriate 
claims covering combination therapies  specific regimens and pharmaceutical forms can be valuable because the therapeutic effect of pharmaceuticals used in the anticancer field is often enhanced when individual therapeutics are used in particular combinations or dosed in a certain way 
the availability of protection in these areas can  however  vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and combination claims are particularly difficult to obtain for many inventions 
we own patent applications pending in the united states  before the epo  one pending pct application still in the international application phase  and over pending patent applications in other countries 
no assurances can be given that patents will be issued with respect to the pending applications  nor that the claims will provide equivalent coverage in all jurisdictions 
in addition to the pending patent applications referred to above that we own  there are pending patent applications worldwide to which we have a license or an option to take a license 
our patent filings for the second generation cdk inhibitor research program exemplify our patent strategy 
out of several series of discovered in this program we filed patent applications seeking substance of matter protection that may be roughly grouped into patent families 
as we have progressed with our research  we have reviewed our patent portfolio and have focused active patent prosecution on patent families covering substance of matter protection 
of these  we have made a european application designating all european patent convention member states and direct national filings in the united states  japan and several additional countries covering the compounds that we believe to be the most promising from a commercial standpoint 
the earliest few applications from this family have resulted in the issuance of european and united states patents with substance of matter claims covering a specific compounds showing activity in preclinical and discovery programs 
since publications in the scientific or patent literature often lag behind actual discoveries  we are not certain of being first to make the inventions covered by each of its pending patent applications or the first to file those patent applications 
generally  patent applications in the united states are maintained in secrecy for a period of months or more  which increases the uncertainty we face 
moreover  the patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies are highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
as a result  we cannot predict the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents  or their enforceability 
to date  there has been no consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents 
third parties or competitors may challenge or circumvent our patents or patent applications  if issued 
because of the extensive time required for development  testing and regulatory review of a potential product  it is possible that before we commercialize any of our products  any related patent may expire  or remain in existence for only a short period following commercialization  thus reducing any advantage of the patent and the commercial opportunity of the product 
if patents are issued to others containing valid claims that cover our compounds or their manufacture or use or screening assays related thereto  we may be required to obtain licenses to these patents or to develop or obtain alternative technology 
we are aware of several published patent applications  and understand that others may exist  that could support claims that  if granted  would cover various aspects of our developmental programs  including in some cases particular uses of our lead drug candidates  sapacitabine  seliciclib  or other therapeutic candidates  or gene sequences and techniques that we use in the course of our research and development 

table of contents in addition  we understand that other applications and patents exist relating to uses of sapacitabine and seliciclib that are not part of our current clinical programs for those compounds 
although we intend to continue to monitor the pending applications  it is not possible to predict whether these claims will ultimately be allowed or if they were allowed what their breadth would be 
in addition  we may need to commence litigation to enforce any patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third party proprietary rights 
litigation would create substantial costs 
in one case we have opposed a european patent relating to human aurora kinase and the patent has been finally revoked no appeal was filed 
we are also aware of a corresponding united states patent containing method of treatment claims for specific cancers using aurora kinase modulators which  if held valid  could potentially restrict the use of our aurora kinase inhibitors once clinical trials are completed 
if competitors prepare and file patent applications in the united states that claim technology that we also claim  we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office to determine which invention has priority 
these proceedings could result in substantial costs  even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us 
an adverse outcome in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties and require us to seek licenses of the disputed rights from third parties or to cease using the technology  even a therapeutic product  if such licenses are unavailable or too expensive 
licenses several of our programs are based on technology licensed from others 
our breach of an existing license or failure to obtain a license to technology required to develop  test and commercialize our products may seriously harm our business 
sapacitabine we have entered into a license agreement with daiichi sankyo co  ltd 
of japan or daiichi sankyo with respect to patents and patent applications covering the sapacitabine compound 
daiichi sankyo filed patent applications claiming sapacitabine and certain crystalline forms of sapacitabine and methods for its preparation and use which encompass our chosen commercial development form as well as related know how and materials 
the daiichi sankyo agreement commenced on september  the issued patents for the sapacitabine compound cover the united states  epo  japan and other countries 
these patents expire between and the issued patents for the crystalline forms cover the united states  epo  japan and ten other countries  with patents pending in a further four countries 
these patents expire in it may be possible to extend the term of a patent in the united states  europe or japan for up to five years to the extent it covers the sapacitabine compound or its crystalline form upon regulatory approval of that compound in the united states  europe or japan  but there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such extension 
the license grants us the exclusive right to exploit and sublicense the sapacitabine compound and any other products covered by the patents and patent applications owned by daiichi sankyo 
the license originally was subject to certain third party rights related to certain countries but the license has been extended and is now worldwide 
the license agreement also grants us nonexclusive  sublicensed rights to cndac  both a precursor compound and initial metabolite of sapacitabine 
we are under an obligation to use reasonable endeavors to develop a product and obtain regulatory approval to sell a product and we have agreed to pay daiichi sankyo an up front fee  reimbursement for daiichi sankyo s enumerated expenses  milestone payments and royalties on a country by country basis 
under this agreement  aggregate milestone payments totaling million could be payable subject to achievement of all the specific contractual milestones and our decision to continue with these projects 
the up front fee and certain past reimbursements have been paid 
royalties are payable in each country for the term of patent protection in the country or for ten years following the first commercial sale of licensed products in the country  whichever is later 
royalties are payable on net sales 
net sales are defined as the gross amount invoiced by us or our affiliates or licensees  less discounts  credits  taxes  shipping and bad debt losses 
the agreement extends from its commencement date to the date on which no further amounts are owed under it 
if we wish to appoint a third party to develop or commercialize a sapacitabine based product in japan  within certain limitations  daiichi sankyo must be notified and given a right of first refusal to develop and or commercialize in japan 
in general  the license may be terminated by us for technical  scientific  efficacy  safety  or commercial reasons on six months notice or twelve if after launch of sapacitabine based product or by either party for material default 
in addition  pursuant to the daiichi sankyo license  we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize products based on the licensed rights and to use reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approval to sell the products in at least one country by september  unless we are prevented from doing so by virtue of an exceptional cause  which generally constitutes a scientific or other technical cause outside of our control or arising from the activities of third parties  difficulties outside of our reasonable control in patient recruitment into trials or any significant  unexpected change in the regulatory requirements in a country affecting the development of our drug candidate 
if regulatory approval is not obtained by september  and there has been no exceptional cause responsible for the delay  the agreement provides that daiichi sankyo may terminate the license 
on termination  if daiichi sankyo wishes to acquire an exclusive license to sapacitabine intellectual property developed by us during the term of the license  daiichi sankyo may notify us and the parties will meet to negotiate commercial terms in good faith 
if agreement cannot be reached  the terms of the exclusive license are to be determined by an expert 

table of contents seliciclib we have entered into an agreement with centre national de recherche scientifique  or cnrs  and institut curie that grants us worldwide rights under the patents jointly owned by cnrs  institut curie and the czech institute of experimental botany covering the seliciclib compound 
the effective date of the agreement is february  the license grants exclusive rights in the fields of auto immune diseases  cardiovascular diseases  dermatological diseases  infectious diseases  inflammatory diseases  and proliferative diseases  including cancer 
non acute chronic diseases of the central nervous system  neurological diseases and diseases of the peripheral nervous system are specifically excluded 
the license runs for the term of the patents in each country  or for ten years from the first commercial sale in each country  whichever is later 
we paid an up front fee and yearly payments and milestone payments until the patents covering the seliciclib compound  particular uses of the compound  and particular uses and derivatives of the compound were published as granted in either the united states or by epo which occurred in and  respectively 
milestones are also payable on the first commercialization of a product that consists of a new chemical entity that is covered by one of the licensed patents 
we will be obligated to pay royalties based on our net sales of products covered by the patents 
royalties are payable on a country by country basis for the term of patent protection in each country or ten years from the first commercial sale of royalty bearing products in that country  whichever is later 
royalties are payable on net sales 
net sales are defined as the gross amount invoiced by us or by our affiliates for the products  less normal trade discounts  credits for returned products  taxes and shipping charges 
there is one royalty rate for products that are covered by valid licensed patent claims and a second  lower royalty rate for all other products that require a license under the licensed patents 
the royalties payable under the agreement are reduced if we are required to pay royalties with respect to patents other than the ones licensed under this agreement and the total amount of royalties that we are required to pay exceeds a fixed percentage amount 
the amount of reduction depends on the amount by which our total royalties exceed the fixed amount 
we must also pay a portion of sublicensing revenues 
the portion of sublicensing revenues that we are required to pay is reduced if we have taken the sublicensed product into human clinical trials 
although the license permits us to grant sublicenses  we cannot assign the license without the consent of the cnrs and institut curie  which may not be unreasonably withheld 
under the agreement  assignment is defined to include many transactions of the type that we might wish to pursue  such as a merger or an acquisition by another company  as well as certain takeovers 
this restriction may prevent us from pursuing attractive business opportunities 
moreover  the occurrence of a majority takeover or a similar transaction that we may be unable to control could cause a default under the license agreement  which could lead to its termination 
we have also purchased from the czech institute of experimental botany patents and patent applications covering the use of seliciclib and related compounds 
the issued patents are in the united states  australia and korea 
under the purchase agreement  we will pay royalties to the czech institute upon sales of products covered by those patents  but only if there are no royalties paid by us to cnrs for those sales under the license agreement with cnrs and institut curie covering seliciclib that is described above 

table of contents patents covering the seliciclib compound are owned jointly by the czech institute of experimental botany and cnrs 
the patents have been issued in the united states and by the epo and expire in it may be possible to extend the term of a patent in the united states or europe for up to five years to the extent it covers the seliciclib compound upon regulatory approval of that compound in the united states or europe  but there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain any such extension 
under agreements between cnrs and the czech institute of experimental botany  cnrs has the exclusive right to enter into license agreements covering the patents 
the agreement reserves to both cnrs and the czech institute of experimental botany certain rights  including the right to patent improvements and to use the patents for internal research purposes 
sinclair pharma plc through the acquisition of align we acquired from sinclair pharma plc  or sinclair  united states and canadian distribution rights to the three commercial products marketed by align xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges 
each of the agreements covering the three products expires in june  at which time we will explore options to renew such agreements 
under these agreements  we have obligations to pay certain quarterly royalties and other amounts pursuant to the agreement which may be reduced or lapse if we exceed certain sales levels 
manufacturing we have no in house manufacturing capabilities and have no current plans to establish manufacturing facilities for significant clinical or commercial production 
we have no direct experience in manufacturing commercial quantities of any of our products  and we currently lack the resources or capability to manufacture any of our products on a clinical or commercial scale 
as a result  we are dependent on corporate partners  licensees or other third parties for the manufacturing of clinical and commercial scale quantities of all of our products 
we believe that this strategy will enable us to direct operational and financial resources to the development of our product candidates rather than diverting resources to establishing a manufacturing infrastructure 
sinclair contracts with third party manufacturers to supply finished goods that meet our needs with respect to xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges 
if any of sinclair s third party manufacturers or service providers do not meet our or our licensor s requirements for quality  quantity or timeliness  or do not achieve and maintain compliance with all applicable regulations  demand for our products or our ability to continue supplying such products could substantially decline 
sales and marketing we currently have a small pharmaceutical commercial sales organization marketing our align products and advertise our align products in industry publications 
if commercially justified  we expect to expand our sales and commercialization group to support our products that may be commercialized for oncology hematology indications and possibly other therapeutic areas 
we intend to market and sell directly products for indications addressing modest patient populations 
for products with indications addressing large patient populations we may partner with other pharmaceutical companies 
in addition  we may accelerate the expansion of our commercial organization to take advantage of any product in licensing and acquisition opportunities that we may elect to pursue 
government regulation the fda and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the clinical development  manufacture  marketing and distribution of drugs 
these agencies and other federal  state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing  manufacture  quality control  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of our drug candidates and commercialized drugs 

table of contents in the united states  the fda regulates drugs under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and implementing regulations 
the process required by the fda before our drug candidates may be marketed in the united states generally involves the following completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests  preclinical animal studies and formulation studies  all performed in accordance with the fda s good laboratory practice  or glp  regulations  submission to the fda of an ind application which must become effective before clinical trials may begin  performance of adequate and well controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication  submission of a nda to the fda  satisfactory completion of an fda pre approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice gmp  or cgmp  regulations  fda review and approval of the nda prior to any commercial marketing  sale or shipment of the drug  and regulation of commercial marketing and sale of drugs 
this testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort and financial resources  and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry  formulation and stability  as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals 
the results of preclinical tests  together with manufacturing information and analytical data  are submitted as part of an ind application to the fda 
the ind automatically becomes effective days after receipt by the fda  unless the fda  within the day time period  raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial  including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks 
in such a case  the ind sponsor and the fda must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin 
our submission of an ind  or those of our collaborators  may not result in fda authorization to commence a clinical trial 
a separate submission to an existing ind must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development 
further  an independent institutional review board  or irb  for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the clinical trial until completed 
the fda  the irb or the clinical trial sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
clinical testing also must satisfy extensive gcp regulations and regulations for informed consent 
clinical trials 
for purposes of an nda submission and approval  clinical trials are typically conducted in the following three sequential phases  which may overlap phase the clinical trials are initially conducted in a limited population to test the drug candidate for safety  dose tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion in healthy humans or  on occasion  in patients  such as cancer patients 
phase clinical trials can be designed to evaluate the impact of the drug candidate in combination with currently approved drugs 
phase these clinical trials are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to determine the efficacy of the drug candidate for specific targeted indications and to determine dose tolerance and optimal dosage 
multiple phase clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive phase clinical trial 
phase these clinical trials are commonly referred to as pivotal clinical trials 
if the phase clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the drug candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile  phase clinical trials are then undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage  to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple  geographically dispersed clinical trial sites 

table of contents in some cases  the fda may condition approval of an nda for a drug candidate on the sponsor s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug s safety and effectiveness after nda approval 
new drug application the results of drug candidate development  preclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the fda as part of an nda 
the nda also must contain extensive manufacturing information 
once the submission has been accepted for filing  by law the fda has days to review the application and respond to the applicant 
the review process is often significantly extended by fda requests for additional information or clarification 
the fda may refer the nda to an advisory committee for review  evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved 
the fda is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee  but it generally follows such recommendations 
the fda may deny approval of an nda if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied  or it may require additional clinical data or an additional pivotal phase clinical trial 
even if such data are submitted  the fda may ultimately decide that the nda does not satisfy the criteria for approval 
data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the fda may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators do 
once issued  the fda may withdraw a drug approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the drug reaches the market 
in addition  the fda may require further testing  including phase clinical trials  and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved drugs which have been commercialized 
the fda has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post marketing programs 
drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label 
further  if there are any modifications to a drug  including changes in indications  labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities  we may be required to submit and obtain fda approval of a new nda or nda supplement  which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials 
fast track designation the fda s fast track program is intended to facilitate the development and to expedite the review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition 
under the fast track program  the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the fda to designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track drug concurrent with or after the filing of the ind for the drug candidate 
the fda must determine if the drug candidate qualifies for fast track designation within days of receipt of the sponsor s request 
if fast track designation is obtained  the fda may initiate review of sections of an nda before the application is complete 
this rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the fda approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees 
however  the time period specified in the prescription drug user fees act  which governs the time period goals the fda has committed to reviewing an application  does not begin until the complete application is submitted 
additionally  the fast track designation may be withdrawn by the fda if the fda believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process 

table of contents in some cases  a fast track designated drug candidate may also qualify for one or more of the following programs priority review 
under fda policies  a drug candidate is eligible for priority review  or review within a six month time frame from the time a complete nda is accepted for filing  if the drug candidate provides a significant improvement compared to marketed drugs in the treatment  diagnosis or prevention of a disease 
we cannot suggest or in any way guarantee that any of our drug candidates will receive a priority review designation  or if a priority designation is received  that review or approval will be faster than conventional fda procedures  or that the fda will ultimately grant drug approval 
accelerated approval 
under the fda s accelerated approval regulations  the fda is authorized to approve drug candidates that have been studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life threatening illnesses  and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit to patients over existing treatments based upon either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint other than patient survival 
in clinical trials  surrogate endpoints are alternative measurements of the symptoms of a disease or condition that are substituted for measurements of observable clinical symptoms 
a drug candidate approved on this basis is subject to rigorous post marketing compliance requirements  including the completion of phase or post approval clinical trials to validate the surrogate endpoint or confirm the effect on the clinical endpoint 
failure to conduct required post approval studies  or to validate a surrogate endpoint or confirm a clinical benefit during post marketing studies  will allow the fda to withdraw the drug from the market on an expedited basis 
all promotional materials for drug candidates approved under accelerated regulations are subject to prior review by the fda 
in rare instances the fda may grant accelerated approval of an nda based on phase data and require confirmatory phase studies to be conducted after approval and or as a condition of maintaining approval 
we can give no assurance that any of our drugs will be reviewed under such procedures 
when appropriate  we and our collaborators may attempt to seek fast track designation or accelerated approval for our drug candidates 
we cannot predict whether any of our drug candidates will obtain a fast track or accelerated approval designation  or the ultimate impact  if any  of the fast track or the accelerated approval process on the timing or likelihood of fda approval of any of our drug candidates 
satisfaction of fda regulations and requirements or similar requirements of state  local and foreign regulatory agencies typically takes several years and the actual time required may vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product or disease 
typically  if a drug candidate is intended to treat a chronic disease  as is the case with some of our drug candidates  safety and efficacy data must be gathered over an extended period of time 
government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of drug candidates for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon our activities 
the fda or any other regulatory agency may not grant approvals for new indications for our drug candidates on a timely basis  if at all 
even if a drug candidate receives regulatory approval  the approval may be significantly limited to specific disease states  patient populations and dosages 
further  even after regulatory approval is obtained  later discovery of previously unknown problems with a drug may result in restrictions on the drug or even complete withdrawal of the drug from the market 
delays in obtaining  or failures to obtain  regulatory approvals for any of our drug candidates would harm our business 
in addition  we cannot predict what adverse governmental regulations may arise from future united states or foreign governmental action 
k section k of the food  drug and cosmetic act requires device manufacturers to notify fda  at least ninety days in advance  of their intent to market a medical device 
this is known as premarket notification  or pmn  or k 
it allows the fda to determine whether the device is equivalent to a device already placed into one of three classification categories 
medical device manufacturers are required to submit a pmn if they intend to introduce a device into commercial distribution for the first time or reintroduce a device that will be significantly changed or modified to the extent that its safety or effectiveness could be affected 
such change or modification could relate to the design  material  chemical composition  energy source  manufacturing process  or intended use 

table of contents other regulatory requirements any products manufactured or distributed by us or our collaborators pursuant to fda approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the fda  including recordkeeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the drug 
drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the fda and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements  including cgmp  which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third party manufacturers 
failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action  such as warning letters  suspension of manufacturing  seizure of product  injunctive action or possible civil penalties 
we cannot be certain that we or our present or future third party manufacturers or suppliers will be able to comply with the cgmp regulations and other ongoing fda regulatory requirements 
if our present or future third party manufacturers or suppliers are not able to comply with these requirements  the fda may halt our clinical trials  require us to recall a product from distribution  or withdraw approval of that product 
the fda closely regulates the post approval marketing and promotion of drugs  including standards and regulations for direct to consumer advertising  off label promotion  industry sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the internet 
a company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy that are approved by the fda 
failure to comply with these requirements can result in adverse publicity  warning letters  corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties 
physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the drug s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the fda 
such off label uses are common across medical specialties 
physicians may believe that such off label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances 
the fda does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments 
the fda does  however  impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers communications regarding off label use 
competition the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are rapidly changing and highly competitive 
we are seeking to develop and market drug candidates that will compete with other products and therapies that currently exist or are being developed 
other companies are actively seeking to develop products that have disease targets similar to those we are pursuing 
we face competition from many different sources  including commercial  pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions  government agencies and private and public research institutions 
many of our competitors have significantly greater financial  manufacturing  marketing and drug development resources than we do 
smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies 
our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer  more effective  have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we may develop 
in addition  competitors compete in the areas of recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel  establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials  as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses 

table of contents a large number of drug candidates are in development for the treatment of leukemia  lung cancer  lymphomas and nasopharyngeal cancer 
several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have nucleoside analogs or other products on the market or in clinical trials which may be competitive to sapacitabine in both hematological and oncology indications 
these include astra zeneca  celgene  cephalon  eisai  eli lilly  genzyme  glaxosmithkline  hospira  johnson johnson  sunesis and vion 
there are two other orally available cdk inhibitors in phase clinical trials 
pd pfizer onyx and pha nerviano medical sciences target different subsets of cdk enzymes and have a different mechanism of action from seliciclib 
there are a number of companies  including astrazeneca  bayer schering  eisai  merck  nerviano medical sciences  pfizer  piramal life sciences  and roche that are developing cdk inhibitors in early stage clinical trials in cancer patients 
although aventis  a predecessor of sanofi aventis  had previously announced that it has ceased phase development of alvocidib or flavopiridol  a cdk inhibitor  we believe that the national cancer institute s cancer therapy evaluation program  or ctep  is continuing to enroll patients in a ctep sponsored trial in patients with chronic leukemia 
a number of companies are pursuing discovery and research activities in each of the other areas that are the subject of our research and drug development programs 
we believe that astrazeneca  entremed  merck  jointly with vertex  nerviano medical sciences  pfizer  rigel  sunesis and takeda millennium have commenced phase or phase clinical trials of aurora kinase inhibitors in patients with advanced cancers 
several companies have reported selection of aurora kinase inhibitor candidates for development and may have started or are expected to start clinical trials within the next twelve months 
we believe that boehringer ingelheim  glaxosmithkline  nerviano medical sciences  onconova  takeda millennium and takmira pharmaceuticals corporation have commenced phase or phase clinical trials with plk inhibitor candidates for oncology indications 
for our align products  we believe that beiersdorf  daiichi sankyo  eisai  johnson johnson  mpm medical and other companies market products for radiation dermatitis and xerostomia 
employees as of march   we had employees 
we believe we have been successful in attracting skilled and experienced management and scientific personnel

risk factors in analyzing our company  you should consider carefully the following risk factors  together with all of the other information included in this annual report on form k 
factors that could cause or contribute to differences in our actual results include those discussed in the following subsection  as well as those discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere throughout this annual report on form k 
each of the following risk factors  either alone or taken together  could adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition  as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our company 
risks associated with development and commercialization of our drug candidates clinical trial designs that were discussed with the authorities prior to their commencement may subsequently be considered insufficient for approval at the time of application for regulatory approval 
thus  our spa regarding our seamless trial does not guarantee marketing approval or approval of our sapacitabine oral capsules for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia 
on september   we reached agreement with the fda regarding an spa on the design of a pivotal phase trial for our sapacitabine oral capsules as a front line treatment in elderly patients aged years or older with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia  or aml  who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy  or the seamless trial 
an spa provides trial sponsors with an agreement from the fda that the design and analysis of the trial adequately address objectives in support of a submission for a marketing application if the trial is performed according to the spa 
the spa may only be changed through a written agreement between the sponsor and the fda or if the fda becomes aware of a substantial scientific issue essential to product efficacy or safety 
on january   we opened enrollment of the seamless trial 
an spa  however  neither guarantees approval nor provides any assurance that a marketing application would be approved by the fda 
there are companies that have been granted spas but have ultimately failed to obtain final approval to market their drugs 
the fda may revise previous guidance or decide to ignore previous guidance at any time during the course of clinical activities or after the completion of clinical trials 
the fda may raise issues relating to  among other things  safety  study conduct  bias  deviation from the protocol  statistical power  patient completion rates  changes in scientific or medical parameters or internal inconsistencies in the data prior to making its final decision 
the fda may also seek the guidance of an outside advisory committee prior to making its final decision 
even with successful clinical safety and efficacy data  including such data from a clinical trial conducted pursuant to an spa  we may be required to conduct additional  expensive clinical trials to obtain regulatory approval 
the development program for our lead drug candidate sapacitabine is based  in part  on intellectual property rights we license from others and any termination of this license could seriously harm our business 
pursuant to the daiichi sankyo license under which we license certain patent rights for sapacitabine  our lead drug candidate  we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize products based on the licensed rights and to use reasonable efforts to obtain regulatory approval to sell the products in at least one country by september  unless we are prevented from doing so by virtue of an exceptional cause  which generally constitutes a scientific or other technical cause outside of our control or arising from the activities of third parties  difficulties outside of our reasonable control in patient recruitment into trials or any significant  unexpected change in the regulatory requirements in a country affecting the development of our drug candidate 
if regulatory approval is not obtained by september  and there has been no exceptional cause responsible for the delay  the agreement provides that daiichi sankyo may terminate the license 
as it is unlikely that regulatory approval for the product will be obtained by september it is the company s intention to negotiate an appropriate amendment to this date on various grounds  among other things  changes that have taken place in the regulatory environment  as provided within the agreement 
if negotiation was not successful  litigation could ensue and there would be no assurances as to the result thereof 
termination of the license agreement could seriously harm our business 
on termination  if daiichi sankyo wishes to acquire an exclusive license to sapacitabine intellectual property developed by us during the term of the license  daiichi sankyo may notify us and the parties will meet to negotiate commercial terms in good faith 
if agreement cannot be reached  the terms of the exclusive license are to be determined by an expert 

table of contents in general  the license may be terminated by us for technical  scientific  efficacy  safety  or commercial reasons on six months notice  or twelve months if after a launch of a sapacitabine based product  or by either party for material default 
although we are currently in compliance with all of our material obligations under this license  if we were to breach any such obligations  our counterparty may be entitled to terminate the license 
this would restrict or delay or eliminate our ability to develop and commercialize these drug candidates  which could adversely affect our business 
if we fail to enter into and maintain successful strategic alliances for our drug candidates  we may have to reduce or delay our drug candidate development or increase our expenditures 
an important element of our strategy for developing  manufacturing and commercializing our drug candidates is entering into strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies or other industry participants to advance our programs and enable us to maintain our financial and operational capacity 
we face significant competition in seeking appropriate alliances 
we may not be able to negotiate alliances on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  these alliances may be unsuccessful 
if we fail to create and maintain suitable alliances  we may have to limit the size or scope of  or delay  one or more of our drug development or research programs 
if we elect to fund drug development or research programs on our own  we will have to increase our expenditures and will need to obtain additional funding  which may be unavailable or available only on unfavorable terms 
clinical trials are expensive  time consuming  subject to delay and may be required to continue beyond our available funding 
clinical trials are expensive  complex can take many years to conduct and may have uncertain outcomes 
we estimate that clinical trials of our most advanced drug candidates may be required to continue beyond our available funding and may take several years more to complete 
the designs used in some of our trials have not been used widely by other pharmaceutical companies 
failure can occur at any stage of the testing and we may experience numerous unforeseen events during  or as a result of  the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our current or future drug candidates  including but not limited to delays in securing clinical investigators or trial sites for our clinical trials  delays in obtaining institutional review board  or irb  and other regulatory approvals to commence a clinical trial  slower than anticipated rates of patient recruitment and enrollment  or reaching the targeted number of patients because of competition for patients from other trials or other reasons  negative or inconclusive results from clinical trials  unforeseen safety issues  uncertain dosing issues may or may not be related to suboptimal pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic behaviors  approval and introduction of new therapies or changes in standards of practice or regulatory guidance that render our clinical trial endpoints or the targeting of our proposed indications obsolete  
table of contents inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment or problems with investigator or patient compliance with the trial protocols  inability to replicate in large controlled studies safety and efficacy data obtained from a limited number of patients in uncontrolled trials  inability or unwillingness of medical investigators to follow our clinical protocols  and unavailability of clinical trial supplies 
if we suffer any significant delays  setbacks or negative results in  or termination of  our clinical trials  we may be unable to continue development of our drug candidates or generate revenue and our development costs could increase significantly 
adverse events have been observed in our clinical trials and may force us to stop development of our product candidates or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates 
adverse or inconclusive results from our clinical trials may substantially delay  or halt entirely  any further development of our drug candidates 
many companies have failed to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of drug candidates in later stage clinical trials notwithstanding favorable results in early stage clinical trials 
previously unforeseen and unacceptable side effects could interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of our drug candidates and could result in the fda or other regulatory authorities denying approval of our drug candidates 
we will need to demonstrate safety and efficacy for specific indications of use  and monitor safety and compliance with clinical trial protocols throughout the development process 
to date  long term safety and efficacy has not been demonstrated in clinical trials for any of our drug candidates 
toxicity and serious adverse events as defined in trial protocols have been noted in preclinical and clinical trials involving certain of our drug candidates 
for example  neutropenia and gastro intestinal toxicity were observed in patients receiving sapacitabine and elevations of liver enzymes and decrease in potassium levels have been observed in patients receiving seliciclib 
in addition  we may pursue clinical trials for sapacitabine and seliciclib in more than one indication 
there is a risk that severe toxicity observed in a trial for one indication could result in the delay or suspension of all trials involving the same drug candidate 
even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our drug candidates are promising with respect to safety and efficacy  such data may not be deemed sufficient by regulatory authorities to warrant product approval 
clinical data can be interpreted in different ways 
regulatory officials could interpret such data in different ways than we do which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
the fda  other regulatory authorities or we may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time 
any failure or significant delay in completing clinical trials for our drug candidates  or in receiving regulatory approval for the commercialization of our drug candidates  may severely harm our business and reputation 
if our understanding of the role played by cdks or aks in regulating the cell cycle is incorrect  this may hinder pursuit of our clinical and regulatory strategy 
our development of small molecule inhibitors of cdk and ak is based on our understanding of the mechanisms of action of cdk and ak inhibitors and their interaction with other cellular mechanisms 
one of our drug candidates  seliciclib  is a cdk inhibitor  and cyc is an ak and vegfr inhibitor 
although a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to develop cdk or ak inhibitor drugs for the treatment of cancer  no cdk or ak inhibitor has yet reached the market 
if our understanding of the role played by cdk or ak inhibitors in regulating the cell cycle is incorrect  seliciclib and or cyc may fail to produce therapeutically relevant results hindering our ability to pursue our clinical and regulatory strategy 
we are making use of biomarkers  which are not scientifically validated  and our reliance on biomarker data may thus lead us to direct our resources inefficiently 
we are making use of biomarkers in an effort to facilitate our drug development and to optimize our clinical trials 
biomarkers are proteins or other substances whose presence in the blood can serve as an indicator of specific cell processes 
we believe that these biological markers serve a useful purpose in helping us to evaluate whether our drug candidates are having their intended effects through their assumed mechanisms  and thus enable us to identify more promising drug candidates at an early stage and to direct our resources efficiently 
we also believe that biomarkers may eventually allow us to improve patient selection in connection with clinical trials and monitor patient compliance with trial protocols 

table of contents for most purposes  however  biomarkers have not been scientifically validated 
if our understanding and use of biomarkers is inaccurate or flawed  or if our reliance on them is otherwise misplaced  then we will not only fail to realize any benefits from using biomarkers  but may also be led to invest time and financial resources inefficiently in attempting to develop inappropriate drug candidates 
moreover  although the fda has issued for comment a draft guidance document on the potential use of biomarker data in clinical development  such data are not currently accepted by the fda or other regulatory agencies in the united states  the european union or elsewhere in applications for regulatory approval of drug candidates and there is no guarantee that such data will ever be accepted by the relevant authorities in this connection 
our biomarker data should not be interpreted as evidence of efficacy 
due to our reliance on contract research organizations or other third parties to conduct clinical trials  we may be unable to directly control the timing  conduct and expense of our clinical trials 
we do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approvals for our drug candidates 
we must rely on third parties  such as contract research organizations  data management companies  contract clinical research associates  medical institutions  clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials 
in addition  we rely on third parties to assist with our preclinical development of drug candidates 
if these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines  if the third parties need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons  our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended  delayed  suspended or terminated  and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our drug candidates 
to the extent we are able to enter into collaborative arrangements or strategic alliances  we will be exposed to risks related to those collaborations and alliances 
although we are not currently party to any collaboration arrangement or strategic alliance that is material to our business  in the future we expect to be dependent upon collaborative arrangements or strategic alliances to complete the development and commercialization of some of our drug candidates particularly after the phase stage of clinical testing 
these arrangements may place the development of our drug candidates outside our control  may require us to relinquish important rights or may otherwise be on terms unfavorable to us 
we may be unable to locate and enter into favorable agreements with third parties  which could delay or impair our ability to develop and commercialize our drug candidates and could increase our costs of development and commercialization 
dependence on collaborative arrangements or strategic alliances will subject us to a number of risks  including the risk that we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators may devote to the drug candidates  our collaborators may experience financial difficulties  we may be required to relinquish important rights such as marketing and distribution rights  business combinations or significant changes in a collaborator s business strategy may also adversely affect a collaborator s willingness or ability to complete our obligations under any arrangement  
table of contents a collaborator could independently move forward with a competing drug candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others  including our competitors  and collaborative arrangements are often terminated or allowed to expire  which would delay the development and may increase the cost of developing our drug candidates 
we have no manufacturing capacity and will rely on third party manufacturers for the late stage development and commercialization of any drugs or devices we may develop or sell 
we do not currently operate manufacturing facilities for clinical or commercial production of our drug candidates under development or our currently marketed align products 
we currently lack the resources or the capacity to manufacture any of our products on a clinical or commercial scale 
we depend upon a third party  sinclair  to manufacture the commercial products sold by our align subsidiary and we can not rely upon sinclair to continue to supply the products 
we anticipate future reliance on a limited number of third party manufacturers until we are able  or decide to  expand our operations to include manufacturing capacities 
any performance failure on the part of manufacturers could delay late stage clinical development or regulatory approval of our drug  the commercialization of our drugs or our ability to sell our commercial products  producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenues 
if the fda or other regulatory agencies approve any of our drug candidates for commercial sale  or if we significantly expand our clinical trials  we will need to manufacture them in larger quantities and will be required to secure alternative third party suppliers to our current suppliers 
to date  our drug candidates have been manufactured in small quantities for preclinical testing and clinical trials and we may not be able to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity  whether in collaboration with our current or future third party manufacturers or on our own  for any of our drug candidates in a timely or economic manner  or at all 
significant scale up of manufacturing may require additional validation studies  which the fda and other regulatory bodies must review and approve 
if we are unable to successfully increase the manufacturing capacity for a drug candidate whether for late stage clinical trials or for commercial sale or are unable to secure alternative third party suppliers to our current suppliers  the drug development  regulatory approval or commercial launch of any related drugs may be delayed or blocked or there may be a shortage in supply 
even if any third party manufacturer makes improvements in the manufacturing process for our drug candidates  we may not own  or may have to share  the intellectual property rights to such innovation 
as we evolve from a company primarily involved in discovery and development to one also involved in the commercialization of drugs and devices  we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth and expanding our operations successfully 
in order to execute our business strategy  we will need to expand our development  control and regulatory capabilities and develop financial  manufacturing  marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us 
if our operations expand  we expect that we will need to manage additional relationships with various collaborative partners  suppliers and other third parties 
our ability to manage our operations and any growth will require us to make appropriate changes and upgrades  as necessary  to our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures wherever we may operate 
any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plan or disrupt our operations 
the failure to attract and retain skilled personnel and key relationships could impair our drug development and commercialization efforts 
we are highly dependent on our senior management and key scientific  technical and sales and marketing personnel 
competition for these types of personnel is intense 
the loss of the services of any member of our senior management  scientific  technical or sales or marketing staff may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of drug development and other business objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we also rely on consultants and advisors to assist us in formulating our strategy 
all of our consultants and advisors are either self employed or employed by other organizations  and they may have conflicts of interest or other commitments  such as consulting or advisory contracts with other organizations  that may affect their ability to contribute to us 
the success of the commercialization of the align products depends  in large part  on our continued ability to develop and maintain important relationships with distributors and research and medical institutions 
failure to do that could have a material adverse effect on our ability to commercialize the align products 

table of contents we intend to expand and develop new drug candidates 
we will need to hire additional employees in order to continue our clinical trials and market our drug candidates and medical devices 
this strategy will require us to recruit additional executive management and scientific and technical personnel 
there is currently intense competition for skilled executives and employees with relevant scientific and technical expertise  and this competition is likely to continue 
the inability to attract and retain sufficient scientific  technical and managerial personnel could limit or delay our product development efforts  which would adversely affect the development of our drug candidates and commercialization of our potential drugs and growth of our business 
our drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation  which can be costly and time consuming  and we may not obtain approvals for the commercialization of any of our drug candidates 
the clinical development  manufacturing  selling and marketing of our drug candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states  the european union and elsewhere 
these regulations also vary in important  meaningful ways from country to country 
we are not permitted to market a potential drug in the united states until we receive approval of an nda from the fda 
we have not received an nda approval from the fda for any of our drug candidates 
obtaining an nda approval is expensive and is a complex  lengthy and uncertain process 
the fda approval process for a new drug involves completion of preclinical studies and the submission of the results of these studies to the fda  together with proposed clinical protocols  manufacturing information  analytical data and other information in an investigational new drug  or ind  which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase  and the most significant costs associated with clinical development are the pivotal or suitable for registration late phase or phase clinical trials as they tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after completion of clinical trials  an nda may be submitted to the fda 
in responding to an nda  the fda may refuse to file the application  or if accepted for filing  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval 
in addition  failure to comply with the fda and other applicable foreign and us regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions 
these include warning letters  civil and criminal penalties  injunctions  product seizure or detention  product recalls  total or partial suspension of production and refusal to approve either pending ndas  or supplements to approved ndas 
despite the substantial time and expense invested in preparation and submission of an nda or equivalents in other jurisdictions  regulatory approval is never guaranteed 
the fda and other regulatory authorities in the united states  the european union and elsewhere exercise substantial discretion in the drug approval process 
the number  size and design of preclinical studies and clinical trials that will be required for fda or other regulatory approval will vary depending on the drug candidate  the disease or condition for which the drug candidate is intended to be used and the regulations and guidance documents applicable to any particular drug candidate 
the fda or other regulators can delay  limit or deny approval of a drug candidate for many reasons  including  but not limited to those discussed in the risk factor which immediately follows  the fact that the fda or other regulatory officials may not approve our or our third party manufacturer s processes or facilities  or the fact that new regulations may be enacted by the fda or other regulators may change their approval policies or adoption of new regulations requiring new or different evidence of safety and efficacy for the intended use of a drug candidate 

table of contents with regard to the align products  and following regulatory approval of any of our drug candidates  we are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and restrictions  which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize our potential products 
with regard to our align products and our drug candidates  if any  approved by the fda or by another regulatory authority  we are held to extensive regulatory requirements over product manufacturing  labeling  packaging  adverse event reporting  storage  advertising  promotion and record keeping 
regulatory approvals may also be subject to significant limitations on the indicated uses or marketing of the drug candidates 
potentially costly follow up or post marketing clinical studies may be required as a condition of approval to further substantiate safety or efficacy  or to investigate specific issues of interest to the regulatory authority 
previously unknown problems with the product or drug candidate  including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  may result in restrictions on the marketing of the drug or device  and could include withdrawal of the drug or device from the market 
in addition  the law or regulatory policies governing pharmaceuticals may change 
new statutory requirements may be enacted or additional regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our drug candidates 
we cannot predict the likelihood  nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action  either in the united states or elsewhere 
if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance  we might not be permitted to market our drugs and our business could suffer 
our applications for regulatory approval could be delayed or denied due to problems with studies conducted before we in licensed the rights to some of our product candidates 
we currently license some of the compounds and drug candidates used in our research programs from third parties 
these include sapacitabine which was licensed from daiichi sankyo 
our present research involving these compounds relies upon previous research conducted by third parties over whom we had no control and before we in licensed the drug candidates 
in order to receive regulatory approval of a drug candidate  we must present all relevant data and information obtained during our research and development  including research conducted prior to our licensure of the drug candidate 
although we are not currently aware of any such problems  any problems that emerge with preclinical research and testing conducted prior to our in licensing may affect future results or our ability to document prior research and to conduct clinical trials  which could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval for our drug candidates 
we face intense competition and our competitors may develop drugs that are less expensive  safer  or more effective than our drug candidates 
a large number of drug candidates are in development for the treatment of leukemia  lung cancer  lymphomas and nasopharyngeal cancer 
several pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have nucleoside analogs or other products on the market or in clinical trials which may be competitive to sapacitabine in both hematological and oncology indications 
these include celgene  cephalon  eisai  johnson johnson  eli lilly  genzyme  glaxosmithkline  hospira  pfizer  seattle genetics  sunesis and vion 
there are two other orally available cdk inhibitor in phase clinical trials 
pd pfizer onyx and pha nerviano medical sciences target different subsets of cdk enzymes and have a different mechanism of action from seliciclib 
we believe that seliciclib is currently the most advanced orally available cdk specific agent in phase clinical trials but that there are a number of companies  including astrazeneca  bayer schering  eisai  merck  nerviano medical sciences  pfizer  piramal life sciences  and roche that are developing cdk inhibitors in early stage clinical trials in cancer patients 
although aventis  a predecessor of sanofi aventis  had previously announced that it has ceased phase development of alvocidib or flavopiridol  a cdk inhibitor  we believe that the national cancer institute s cancer therapy evaluation program  or ctep  is continuing to enroll patients in a ctep sponsored trial in patients with chronic leukemia 
a number of companies are pursuing discovery and research activities in each of the other areas that are the subject of our research and drug development programs 
we believe that astrazeneca  entremed  merck  jointly with vertex  nerviano medical sciences  pfizer  rigel  sunesis and takeda millennium have commenced phase or phase clinical trials of aurora kinase inhibitors in patients with advanced cancers 
several companies have reported selection of aurora kinase inhibitor candidates for development and may have started or are expected to start clinical trials within the next twelve months 
we believe that boehringer ingelheim  glaxosmithkline  nerviano medical sciences  onconova  takeda millennium and tekmira pharmaceuticals corporation have commenced phase or phase clinical trials with plk inhibitor candidates for oncology indications 
for our align products  we believe that beiersdorf  daiichi sankyo  eisai  johnson johnson  mpm medical and other companies market products for radiation dermatitis and xerostomia 

table of contents our competitors  either alone or together with collaborators  may have substantially greater financial resources and research and development staff 
our competitors may also have more experience developing drug candidates  conducting preclinical and clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  and commercializing product candidates 
our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection and regulatory approval and may market drugs before we do 
if our competitors market drugs that are less expensive  safer  more effective or more convenient to administer than our potential drugs  or that reach the market sooner than our potential drugs  we may not achieve commercial success 
scientific  clinical or technical developments by our competitors may render our drug candidates obsolete or noncompetitive 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the markets and as scientific developments progress 
if our drug candidates obtain regulatory approvals  but do not compete effectively in the marketplace  our business will suffer 
the commercial success of the align products and our drug candidates depends upon their market acceptance among physicians  patients  healthcare providers and payors and the medical community 
it is necessary that our and our distribution partners products  including xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges achieve and maintain market acceptance 
if our drug candidates are approved by the fda or by another regulatory authority  the resulting drugs  if any  may not gain market acceptance among physicians  healthcare providers and payors  patients and the medical community 
the degree of market acceptance of any of our approved drugs or devices will depend on a variety of factors  including timing of market introduction  number and clinical profile of competitive drugs  our ability to provide acceptable evidence of safety and efficacy  relative convenience and ease of administration  cost effectiveness  availability of coverage  reimbursement and adequate payment from health maintenance organizations and other third party payors  prevalence and severity of adverse side effects  and other potential advantages over alternative treatment methods 
if our drugs fail to achieve market acceptance  we may not be able to generate significant revenue and our business would suffer 

table of contents if we are unable to compete successfully in our market place  it will harm our business 
there are existing products in the marketplace that compete with our products 
companies may develop new products that compete with our products 
certain of these competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater product development capabilities and financial  scientific  marketing and sales resources 
competitors and potential competitors may also develop products that are safer  more effective or have other potential advantages compared to our products 
in addition  research  development and commercialization efforts by others could render our products obsolete or non competitive 
certain of our competitors and potential competitors have broader product offerings and extensive customer bases allowing them to adopt aggressive pricing policies that would enable them to gain market share 
competitive pressures could result in price reductions  reduced margins and loss of market share 
we could encounter potential customers that  due to existing relationships with our competitors  are committed to products offered by those competitors 
as a result  those potential customers may not consider purchasing our products 
there is uncertainty related to coverage  reimbursement and payment by healthcare providers and payors for the align products and newly approved drugs  if any 
the inability or failure to obtain or maintain coverage could affect our ability to market the align products and our future drugs and decrease our ability to generate revenue 
the availability and levels of coverage and reimbursement of newly approved drugs by healthcare providers and payors is subject to significant uncertainty 
the commercial success of the align products and our drug candidates in both the united states and international markets is substantially dependent on whether third party coverage and reimbursement is available 
the united states centers for medicare and medicaid services  health maintenance organizations and other third party payors in the united states  the european union and other jurisdictions are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs and  as a result  they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our potential drugs 
the align products and our drug candidates may not be considered cost effective and reimbursement may not be available to consumers or may not be sufficient to allow the align products or our drug candidates to be marketed on a competitive basis 
in some countries  pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control 
in such countries  pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take three to months or longer following application to the competent authorities 
to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in such countries may require conducting an additional clinical trial comparing the cost effectiveness of the drug to other alternatives 
in the united states  the medicare part d drug benefit implemented in will limit drug coverage through formularies and other cost and utilization management programs  while medicare part b limits drug payments to a certain percentage of average price or through restrictive payment policies of least costly alternatives and inherent reasonableness our business could be materially harmed if coverage  reimbursement or pricing is unavailable or set at unsatisfactory levels 
intellectual property rights and distribution rights for our drug candidate seliciclib and align products are licensed from others  and any termination of these licenses could harm our business 
we have in licensed certain patent rights in connection with the development program of our drug candidate seliciclib 
pursuant to the cnrs and institut curie license under which we license seliciclib  we are obligated to pay license fees  milestone payments and royalties and provide regular progress reports 
we are also obligated to use reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize products based on the licensed patents 
we have in licensed from sinclair the distribution rights to the align products 
this license agreement imposes obligations on us and is expected to expire in although we are currently in compliance with all of our material obligations under this license  if we were to breach any such obligations  sinclair would be permitted to terminate the license 
in addition  if we unable to extend the term of the license agreement  it would prevent us from distributing the align products 

table of contents although we are currently in compliance with all of our material obligations under these licenses  if we were to breach any such obligations our counterparties may be entitled to terminate the licenses 
this would restrict or delay or eliminate our ability to develop and commercialize the seliciclib or sell the align products  which could adversely affect our business 
we may be exposed to product liability claims that may damage our reputation and we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance 
because we conduct clinical trials in humans  we face the risk that the use of our drug candidates will result in adverse effects 
we believe that we have obtained reasonably adequate product liability insurance coverage for our trials 
we cannot predict  however  the possible harm or side effects that may result from our clinical trials 
such claims may damage our reputation and we may not have sufficient resources to pay for any liabilities resulting from a claim excluded from  or beyond the limit of  our insurance coverage 
as we market commercialized products through our align subsidiary we are exposed to additional risks of product liability claims 
these risks exist even with respect to drugs and devices that are approved for commercial sale by the fda or other regulatory authorities in the united states  the european union or elsewhere and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the fda or other such regulatory authorities 
we have secured limited product liability insurance coverage  but may not be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms with adequate coverage  or at a reasonable cost 
there is also a risk that third parties that we have agreed to indemnify could incur liability 
even if we were ultimately successful in product liability litigation  the litigation would consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources and may exceed insurance coverage creating adverse publicity  all of which would impair our ability to generate sales of the litigated product as well as our other potential drugs 
we may be required to defend lawsuits or pay damages in connection with the alleged or actual violation of healthcare statutes such as fraud and abuse laws  and our corporate compliance programs can never guarantee that we are in compliance with all relevant laws and regulations 
our commercialization efforts in the united states are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to promotion and healthcare fraud and abuse  including federal and state anti kickback  fraud and false claims laws 
anti kickback laws make it illegal for a manufacturer to offer or pay any remuneration in exchange for  or to induce  the referral of business  including the purchase of a product 
the federal government has published many regulations relating to the anti kickback statutes  including numerous safe harbors or exemptions for certain arrangements 
false claims laws prohibit anyone from knowingly and willingly presenting  or causing to be presented for payment to third party payers including medicare and medicaid  claims for reimbursed products or services that are false or fraudulent  claims for items or services not provided as claimed  or claims for medically unnecessary items or services 
our activities relating to the sale and marketing of our products will be subject to scrutiny under these laws and regulations 
it may be difficult to determine whether or not our activities  comply with these complex legal requirements 
violations are punishable by significant criminal and or civil fines and other penalties  as well as the possibility of exclusion of the product from coverage under governmental healthcare programs  including medicare and medicaid 
if the government were to investigate or make allegations against us or any of our employees  or sanction or convict us or any of our employees  for violations of any of these legal requirements  this could have a material adverse effect on our business  including our stock price 
our activities could be subject to challenge for many reasons  including the broad scope and complexity of these laws and regulations  the difficulties in interpreting and applying these legal requirements  and the high degree of prosecutorial resources and attention being devoted to the biopharmaceutical industry and health care fraud by law enforcement authorities 
during the last few years  numerous biopharmaceutical companies have paid multi million dollar fines and entered into burdensome settlement agreements for alleged violation of these requirements  and other companies are under active investigation 
although we have developed and implemented corporate and field compliance programs as part of our commercialization efforts  we cannot assure you that we or our employees  directors or agents were  are or will be in compliance with all laws and regulations or that we will not come under investigation  allegation or sanction 

table of contents in addition  we may be required to prepare and report product pricing related information to federal and state governmental authorities  such as the department of veterans affairs and under the medicaid program 
the calculations used to generate the pricing related information are complex and require the exercise of judgment 
if we fail to accurately and timely report product pricing related information or to comply with any of these or any other laws or regulations  various negative consequences could result  including criminal and or civil prosecution  substantial criminal and or civil penalties  exclusion of the approved product from coverage under governmental healthcare programs including medicare and medicaid  costly litigation and restatement of our financial statements 
in addition  our efforts to comply with this wide range of laws and regulations are  and will continue to be  time consuming and expensive 
if our supplier upon whom we rely fails to produce on a timely basis the finished goods in the volumes that we require or fails to meet quality standards and maintain necessary licensure from regulatory authorities  we may be unable to meet demand for our products  potentially resulting in lost revenues 
our licensor and supplier sinclair contracts with third party manufacturers to supply the finished goods to us to meet our needs 
if any of sinclair s third party manufacturers service providers do not meet our or our licensor s requirements for quality  quantity or timeliness  or do not achieve and maintain compliance with all applicable regulations  demand for our products or our ability to continue supplying such products could substantially decline 
as the third party manufacturers are the sole supplier of the products any delays may impact our sales 
in all the countries where we sell or may sell our products  governmental regulations exist to define standards for manufacturing  packaging  labeling and storing 
all of our suppliers of raw materials and contract manufacturers must comply with these regulations 
failure to do so could result in supply interruptions 
in the united states  the fda requires that all suppliers of pharmaceutical bulk material and all manufacturers of pharmaceuticals for sale in or from the united states achieve and maintain compliance with the fda s current good manufacturing practice or cgmp regulations and guidelines 
failure of our third party manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on them or us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  disgorgement  suspension or withdrawal of approvals  license revocation  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions  any of which could significantly and adversely affect supplies of our products 
in addition  before any product batch produced by our manufacturers can be shipped  it must conform to release specifications pre approved by regulators for the content of the pharmaceutical product 
if the operations of one or more of our manufacturers were to become unavailable for any reason  any required fda review and approval of the operations of an alternative supplier could cause a delay in the manufacture of our products 
our customer base is highly concentrated 
our principal customers are a small number of wholesale drug distributors 
these customers comprise a significant part of the distribution network for pharmaceutical products in the united states 
three large wholesale distributors  amerisourcebergen corporation  cardinal health  inc and mckesson corporation  control a significant share of the market in the united states 
our ability to distribute any product  including xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges and to recognize revenues on a timely basis is substantially dependent on our ability to maintain commercially reasonable agreements with each of these wholesale distributors and the extent to which these distributors  over whom we have no control  comply with such agreements 
our agreements with wholesaler distributors may contain terms that are not favorable  given our relative lack of market leverage as a company with only three approved products or other factors  which could adversely affect our commercialization of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges 
the loss of any of these customers could materially and adversely affect our ability to distribute our products  resulting in a negative impact on our operations and financial condition 

table of contents we may be unable to accurately estimate demand and monitor wholesaler inventory of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid or numoisyn lozenges 
although we attempt to monitor wholesaler inventory of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid or numoisyn lozenges  we also rely on third party information  which is inherently uncertain and may not be accurate  to assist us in monitoring estimated inventory levels and prescription trends 
inaccurate estimates of the demand and inventory levels of the product may cause our revenues to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may cause our operating results for a particular quarter to be below expectations 
inventory levels of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid or numoisyn lozenges held by wholesalers can also cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and  respectively  of our product sales in the united states were to three wholesalers  cardinal health  inc  mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen 
inventory levels held by those wholesalers can cause our operating results to fluctuate unexpectedly if our sales to wholesalers do not match customer demand 
we have entered into inventory management agreements with these us wholesalers under which they provide us with data regarding inventory levels at these wholesalers 
however  these wholesalers may not be completely effective in matching inventory levels to customer demand  as they make estimates to determine customer demand 
in addition  inventory is held at retail pharmacies and other non wholesaler locations  for which we have no inventory management agreements and have no control in respect to their buying patterns 
also  the non retail sector in the united states  which includes government institutions and large health maintenance organizations  tends to be less consistent in terms of buying patterns  and often causes quarter over quarter fluctuations in inventory and ordering patterns 
we attempt to monitor inventory of xclair  numoisyn liquid or numoisyn lozenges in the united states through the use of internal sales forecasts and the expiration dates of product shipped  among other factors 
the commercialization of our products is substantially dependent on our ability to develop effective sales and marketing capabilities 
our successful commercialization of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges in the united states will depend on our ability to establish and maintain an effective sales and marketing organization in the united states 
we hired trained and deployed additional marketing personnel and a small oncology specialty sales force 
we may increase or decrease the size of our sales force in the future  depending on many factors  including the effectiveness of the sales force  the level of market acceptance of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges and the results of our clinical trials 
prior to our launches of these products  we had never sold or marketed any products 
for our product candidates currently under development  our strategy is to develop compounds through the phase stage of clinical testing and market or co promote certain of our drugs on our own 
we have limited sales  marketing or distribution capabilities 
we will depend primarily on strategic alliances with third parties  which have established distribution systems and sales forces  to commercialize our drugs 
to the extent that we are unsuccessful in commercializing any drugs or devices ourselves or through a strategic alliance  product revenues will suffer  we will incur significant additional losses and our share price will be negatively affected 
defending against claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of hazardous chemical  radioactive or biological materials could be time consuming and expensive 
our research and development involves the controlled use of hazardous materials  including chemicals  radioactive and biological materials such as chemical solvents  phosphorus and bacteria 
our operations produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from those materials 
various laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling and disposal of hazardous materials 
we may be sued for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties of these materials 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development and production efforts 
risks related to our business and financial condition the current economic conditions and financial market turmoil could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
economic conditions remain difficult with the continuing uncertainty in the global credit markets  the financial services industry and the united states capital markets and with the united states economy as a whole experiencing a period of substantial turmoil and uncertainty characterized by unprecedented intervention by the united states federal government and the failure  bankruptcy  or sale of various financial and other institutions 
we believe the current economic conditions and financial market turmoil could adversely affect our operations  business and prospects  as well as our ability to obtain funds 
if these circumstances persist or continue to worsen  our future operating results could be adversely affected  particularly relative to our current expectations 

table of contents we are at an early stage of development as a company and we do not have  and may never have  any products that generate significant revenues 
we are at an early stage of development as a company and have a limited operating history on which to evaluate our business and prospects 
while we have earned modest product revenues from the align business acquired in october  since beginning operations in  we have not generated any product revenues from our product candidates currently in development 
we cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates currently in development will ever become marketable products and we do not anticipate material revenues from the align products in the foreseeable future 
we must demonstrate that our drug candidates satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy for their intended uses before the fda  and other regulatory authorities in the united states  the european union and elsewhere 
significant additional research  preclinical testing and clinical testing is required before we can file applications with the fda or other regulatory authorities for premarket approval of our drug candidates 
in addition  to compete effectively  our drugs must be easy to administer  cost effective and economical to manufacture on a commercial scale 
we may not achieve any of these objectives 
sapacitabine  our most advanced drug candidates for the treatment of cancer  is currently in phase for aml and phase for mds 
seliciclib is currently in phase clinical trials 
a combination trial of sapacitabine and seliciclib is currently in a phase clinical trial 
we cannot be certain that the clinical development of these or any other drug candidates in preclinical testing or clinical development will be successful  that we will receive the regulatory approvals required to commercialize them or that any of our other research and drug discovery programs will yield a drug candidate suitable for investigation through clinical trials 
our commercial revenues from our product candidates currently in development  if any  will be derived from sales of drugs that will not become marketable for several years  if at all 
we have a history of operating losses and we may never become profitable 
our stock is a highly speculative investment 
we have incurred operating losses in each year since beginning operations in due to costs incurred in connection with our research and development activities and selling  general and administrative costs associated with our operations  and we may never achieve profitability 
as of december  and  our accumulated deficit was million and million  respectively 
our net loss for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
our net loss applicable to common stockholders from inception through december  was million 
our drug candidates are in the mid stages of clinical testing and we must conduct significant additional clinical trials before we can seek the regulatory approvals necessary to begin commercial sales of our drugs 
we expect to incur continued losses for several years  as we continue our research and development of our drug candidates  seek regulatory approvals  commercialize any approved drugs and market and promote the align products xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges 
if our drug candidates are unsuccessful in clinical trials or we are unable to obtain regulatory approvals  or if our drugs are unsuccessful in the market  we will not be profitable 
if we fail to become and remain profitable  or if we are unable to fund our continuing losses  particularly in light of the current economic conditions  you could lose all or part of your investment 
capital markets are currently experiencing a period of disruption and instability  which has had and could continue to have a negative impact on the availability and cost of capital 
the general disruption in the united states capital markets has impacted the broader worldwide financial and credit markets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole 
these global conditions could persist for a prolonged period of time or worsen in the future 
our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to access those markets  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
the resulting lack of available credit  lack of confidence in the financial sector  increased volatility in the financial markets could materially and adversely affect the cost of debt financing and the proceeds of equity financing may be materially adversely impacted by these market conditions 

table of contents if we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the nasdaq global market our common stock price may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted 
our common stock is currently listed for trading on the nasdaq global market 
we must satisfy nasdaq s continued listing requirements  including among other things  a minimum stockholders equity of million and a minimum bid price for our common stock of per share  or risk delisting  which would have a material adverse affect on our business 
a delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global market could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock 
in addition  delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us  or at all  and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors  suppliers  customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities 
during  cyclacel received notification from the nasdaq stock market that the company was not in compliance with the minimum million stockholders equity requirement for continued listing set forth in nasdaq marketplace rule b a 
on january   nasdaq notified the company that it regained compliance with the minimum million market value of listed securities requirement and that it currently complies with all other applicable standards for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
accordingly  the company s shares of common and preferred stock will continue to trade on the nasdaq global market 
raising additional capital in the future may not be available to us on reasonable terms  if at all  when or as we require additional funding 
if we issue additional shares of our common stock or other securities that may be convertible into  or exercisable or exchangeable for  our common stock  our existing stockholders would experience further dilution 
if we fail to obtain additional funding  we may be unable to complete the development and commercialization of our lead drug candidate  sapacitabine  or continue to fund our research and development programs 
we have funded all of our operations and capital expenditures with proceeds from the issuance of public equity securities  private placements of our securities  interest on investments  licensing revenue  government grants  research and development tax credits and product revenue 
in order to conduct the lengthy and expensive research  preclinical testing and clinical trials necessary to complete the development and marketing of our drug candidates  we will require substantial additional funds 
based on our current operating plans of focusing on the advancement of sapacitabine  we expect our existing resources to be sufficient to fund our planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
to meet our long term financing requirements  we may raise funds through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or strategic alliances 
raising additional funds by issuing equity or convertible debt securities may cause our stockholders to experience substantial dilution in their ownership interests and new investors may have rights superior to the rights of our other stockholders 
raising additional funds through debt financing  if available  may involve covenants that restrict our business activities and options 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements  we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our drug discovery and other technologies  research programs or drug candidates  or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us 
additional funding may not be available to us on favorable terms  or at all  particularly in light of the current economic conditions 
if we are unable to obtain additional funds  we may be forced to delay or terminate our current clinical trials and the development and marketing of our drug candidates including sapacitabine 

table of contents to the extent we elect to fund the development of a drug candidate or the commercialization of a drug at our expense  we will need substantial additional funding 
we plan to market drugs on our own  with or without a partner  that can be effectively commercialized and sold in concentrated markets that do not require a large sales force to be competitive 
to achieve this goal  we will need to establish our own specialized sales force  marketing organization and supporting distribution capabilities 
the development and commercialization of our drug candidates is very expensive  including our anticipated phase clinical trials for sapacitabine 
to the extent we elect to fund the full development of a drug candidate or the commercialization of a drug at our expense  we will need to raise substantial additional funding to fund research and development and clinical trials connected with our research  fund clinical trials and seek regulatory approvals  build or access manufacturing and commercialization capabilities  implement additional internal control systems and infrastructure  commercialize and secure coverage  payment and reimbursement of our drug candidates  if any such candidates receive regulatory approval  maintain  defend and expand the scope of our intellectual property  and hire additional management  sales and scientific personnel 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs associated with establishing sales and marketing capabilities  the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses  products and technologies  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the payment  other terms and timing of any strategic alliance  licensing or other arrangements that we may establish 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  especially in light of the current economic conditions and financial market turmoil  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or future commercialization efforts 
any future workforce and expense reductions may have an adverse impact on our internal programs  strategic plans  and our ability to hire and retain key personnel  and may also be distracting to our management 
further workforce and expense reductions in addition to those carried out in september and june could result in significant delays in implementing our strategic plans 
in addition  employees  whether or not directly affected by such reduction  may seek future employment with our business partners or competitors 
although our employees are required to sign a confidentiality agreement at the time of hire  the confidential nature of certain proprietary information may not be maintained in the course of any such future employment 
in addition  any additional workforce reductions or restructurings would be expected to involve significant expense as a result of contractual terms in certain of our existing agreements  including potential severance obligations as well as any payments that may  under certain circumstances  be required under our agreement with the scottish enterprise 
further  we believe that our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled personnel 
we may have difficulty retaining and attracting such personnel as a result of a perceived risk of future workforce and expense reductions 
finally  the implementation of expense reduction programs may result in the diversion of the time and attention of our executive management team and other key employees  which could adversely affect our business 

table of contents budget constraints resulting from our restructuring plan may negatively impact our research and development  forcing us to delay our efforts to develop certain product candidates in favor of developing others  which may prevent us from commercializing our product candidates as quickly as possible 
research and development is an expensive process 
as part of our restructuring plan  we have decided to focus our clinical development priorities on sapacitabine  while still possibly continuing to progress additional programs pending the availability of clinical data and the availability of funds  at which time we will determine the feasibility of pursuing  if at all  further advanced development of seliciclib  cyc or additional programs 
because we have had to prioritize our development candidates as a result of budget constraints  we may not be able to fully realize the value of our product candidates in a timely manner  if at all 
we are exposed to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates 
some of our costs and expenses are denominated in foreign currencies 
most of our foreign expenses are associated with our research and development operations of our united kingdom based wholly owned subsidiary 
when the united states dollar weakens against the british pound  the united states dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense increases  and when the united states dollar strengthens against the british pound  the united states dollar value of the foreign currency denominated expense decreases 
consequently  changes in exchange rates  and in particular a weakening of the united states dollar  may adversely affect our results of operations risks related to our intellectual property we may be subject to damages resulting from claims that our employees or we have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers 
many of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies  including our competitors or potential competitors 
although no claims against us are currently pending  we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers 
litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims 
if we fail in defending such claims  in addition to paying monetary damages  we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel 
a loss of key research personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain potential drugs  which could severely harm our business 
even if we are successful in defending against these claims  litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management 
if we fail to enforce adequately or defend our intellectual property rights our business may be harmed 
our commercial success depends in large part on obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection for our drug candidates  the methods used to manufacture those drug candidates and the methods for treating patients using those drug candidates 
specifically  sapacitabine is covered in granted  composition of matter patents that expire in in the united states and outside the united states 
sapacitabine is further protected by additional granted  composition of matter patents claiming certain  stable crystalline forms of sapacitabine and their pharmaceutical compositions and therapeutic uses that expire in in early development  amorphous sapacitabine was used 
we have used one of the stable  crystalline forms of sapacitabine in nearly all our phase and in all of our phase clinical studies 
we have also chosen this form for commercialization 
additional patents claim certain medical uses and formulations of sapacitabine which have emerged in our clinical trials 
seliciclib is protected by granted  composition of matter patents that expire in additional patents claim certain medical uses which have emerged from our research programs 

table of contents failure to obtain  maintain or extend the patents could adversely affect our business 
we will only be able to protect our drug candidates and our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets cover them 
our ability to obtain patents is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protections and may not adequately protect our rights or permit it to gain or keep any competitive advantage 
some legal principles remain unresolved and the breadth or interpretation of claims allowed in patents in the united states  the european union or elsewhere can still be difficult to ascertain or predict 
in addition  the specific content of patents and patent applications that are necessary to support and interpret patent claims is highly uncertain due to the complex nature of the relevant legal  scientific and factual issues 
changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the united states  the european union or elsewhere may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection 
our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies 
in addition  we generally do not control the patent prosecution of subject matter that we license from others and have not controlled the earlier stages of the patent prosecution 
accordingly  we are unable to exercise the same degree of control over this intellectual property as we would over our own 
even if patents are issued regarding our drug candidates or methods of using them  those patents can be challenged by our competitors who may argue such patents are invalid and or unenforceable 
patents also will not protect our drug candidates if competitors devise ways of making or using these product candidates without legally infringing our patents 
the us federal food  drug and cosmetic  or fd c  act and fda regulations and policies and equivalents in other jurisdictions provide incentives to manufacturers to challenge patent validity or create modified  noninfringing versions of a drug in order to facilitate the approval of abbreviated new drug applications for generic substitutes 
these same types of incentives encourage manufacturers to submit new drug applications that rely on literature and clinical data not prepared for or by the drug sponsor 
proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know how are also very important to our business 
we rely on trade secrets to protect our technology  especially where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable 
however  trade secrets are difficult to protect 
our employees  consultants  contractors  outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors  and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
enforcing a claim that a third party obtained illegally and is using trade secrets is expensive and time consuming  and the outcome is unpredictable 
moreover  our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge  methods and know how 
failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position 
intellectual property rights of third parties may increase our costs or delay or prevent us from being able to commercialize our drug candidates and or the align products 
there is a risk that we are infringing or will infringe the proprietary rights of third parties because patents and pending applications belonging to third parties exist in the united states  the european union and elsewhere in the world in the areas of our research and or the align products 
others might have been the first to make the inventions covered by each of our or our licensors pending patent applications and issued patents and might have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions 
we are aware of several published patent applications  and understand that others may exist  that could support claims that  if granted  could cover various aspects of our developmental programs  including in some cases particular uses of our lead drug candidate sapacitabine  seliciclib or other therapeutic candidates  or gene sequences and techniques that we use in the course of our research and development 
in addition  we understand that other applications and patents exist relating to potential uses of sapacitabine and seliciclib that are not 
table of contents part of our current clinical programs for these compounds 
numerous third party united states and foreign issued patents and pending applications exist in the area of kinases  including cdk  ak and plk for which we have research programs 
for example  some pending patent applications contain broad claims that could represent freedom to operate limitations for some of our kinase programs should they be issued unchanged 
although we intend to continue to monitor these applications  we cannot predict what claims will ultimately be allowed and if allowed what their scope would be 
in addition  because the patent application process can take several years to complete  there may be currently pending applications  unknown to us  which may later result in issued patents that cover the production  manufacture  commercialization or use of our drug candidates 
if we wish to use the technology or compound claimed in issued and unexpired patents owned by others  we will need to obtain a license from the owner  enter into litigation to challenge the validity of the patents or incur the risk of litigation in the event that the owner asserts that we infringe its patents 
in one case we have opposed a european patent relating to human aurora kinase and the patent has been finally revoked no appeal was filed 
we are also aware of a corresponding us patent containing method of treatment claims for specific cancers using aurora kinase modulators which  if held valid  could potentially restrict the use of our aurora kinase inhibitors once clinical trials are completed 
there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries 
defending against third party claims  including litigation in particular  would be costly and time consuming and would divert management s attention from our business  which could lead to delays in our development or commercialization efforts 
if third parties are successful in their claims  we might have to pay substantial damages or take other actions that are adverse to our business 
as a result of intellectual property infringement claims  or to avoid potential claims  we might be prohibited from selling or licensing any product that we may develop unless the patent holder licenses the patent to us  which it is not required to do  be required to pay substantial royalties or grant a cross license to our patents to another patent holder  decide to move some of our screening work outside europe  be required to pay substantial damages for past infringement  which we may have to pay if a court determines that our product candidates or technologies infringe a competitor s patent or other proprietary rights  or be required to redesign the formulation of a drug candidate so it does not infringe  which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time 
risks related to securities regulations and investment in our securities failure to achieve and maintain internal controls is accordance with sections and of the sarbanes oxley act of could have a material adverse affect on our business and stock price 
during march  we identified a deficiency in respect of our internal controls over financial reporting  specifically our controls over the accounting for cumulative preferred stock dividends  that constitutes a material weakness as described in the sec s guidance regarding management s report on internal control over financial reporting as of december  as a result of this deficiency  the financial statements included in our form k for the year ended december   filed on march   as amended by amendment no 
to our annual report on form k a for the year ended december  filed on may  and  as further amended by amendment no 
to our annual report on form k a for the year ended december  filed on may   included errors related to the presentation and disclosure of undeclared cumulative preferred stock dividends in the consolidated balance sheet and in the statement of stockholders equity 
unaudited balance sheets for the each of the first three quarters of and also contained errors 
in addition  in may  we filed an amendment to our annual report on form k for the year ended december   to report a restatement of our financial statements and report a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of december   specifically related to the operational failure of the controls in place to ensure the correct computation of net loss per share and presentation of preferred stock dividends in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
in march  our auditors identified a further error in respect of the accounting  presentation and disclosure of cumulative undeclared preferred stock dividends 
specifically  the inclusion of undeclared cumulative preferred stock dividends as a current liability its consolidated financial statements  which resulted from the same material weakness as described above 
this has resulted in the restatement of our consolidated balance sheets as of march   june   september   december   march   june   and september  and consolidated statement of stockholders equity for the year ended december  and selected financial data as of and for the year ended december  
table of contents if we fail to maintain our internal controls or fail to implement required new or improved controls  as such control standards are modified  supplemented or amended from time to time  we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in the prevention of financial fraud 
if we cannot produce reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed 
we incur increased costs and management resources as a result of being a public company  and we still may fail to comply with public company obligations 
as a public company  we face and will continue to face increased legal  accounting  administrative and other costs and expenses as a public company that we would not incur as a private company 
compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as other rules of the sec  the public company accounting oversight board and the nasdaq global market resulted in a significant initial cost to us as well as an ongoing compliance costs 
as a public company  we are subject to section of the sarbanes oxley act relating to internal control over financial reporting 
we have completed a formal process to evaluate our internal controls for purposes of section  and we concluded that as of december   our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective 
as our business grows and changes  there can be no assurances that we can maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and  together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures  are designed to prevent fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our operating results could be harmed 
we have completed a formal process to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting 
however  guidance from regulatory authorities in the area of internal controls continues to evolve and substantial uncertainty exists regarding our on going ability to comply by applicable deadlines 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
our common stock may have a volatile public trading price 
an active public market for our common stock has not developed 
our stock can trade in small volumes which may make the price of our stock highly volatile 
the last reported price of our stock may not represent the price at which you would be able to buy or sell the stock 
the market prices for securities of companies comparable to us have been highly volatile 
often  these stocks have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons that are both related and unrelated to the operating performance of the individual companies 
in addition  the stock market as a whole and biotechnology and other life science stocks in particular have experienced significant recent volatility 
like our common stock  these stocks have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations for reasons unrelated to the operating performance of the individual companies 
in addition  due to our existing stock price  we may not continue to qualify for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
to maintain listing  we are required to maintain a minimum closing bid price of per share and  among other requirements  to maintain a minimum stockholders equity value of million 
factors giving rise to this volatility may include disclosure of actual or potential clinical results with respect to product candidates we are developing  regulatory developments in both the united states and abroad  
table of contents developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents and litigation matters  public concern about the safety or efficacy of our product candidates or technology  or related technology  or new technologies generally  concern about the safety or efficacy of our product candidates or technology  or related technology  or new technologies generally  public announcements by our competitors or others  and general market conditions and comments by securities analysts and investors 
fluctuations in our operating losses could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
our operating losses may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
some of the factors that may cause our operating losses to fluctuate on a period to period basis include the status of our preclinical and clinical development programs  level of expenses incurred in connection with our preclinical and clinical development programs  implementation or termination of collaboration  licensing  manufacturing or other material agreements with third parties  non recurring revenue or expenses under any such agreement  and compliance with regulatory requirements 
period to period comparisons of our historical and future financial results may not be meaningful  and investors should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
our fluctuating losses may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
our failure to meet these expectations may cause the price of our common stock to decline 
if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about us  if they change their recommendations regarding our stock adversely or if our operating results do not meet their expectations  our stock price and trading volume could decline 
the trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us 
if one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us  we could lose visibility in the financial markets  which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline 
moreover  if one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or if our operating results do not meet their expectations  our stock price could decline 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and provisions of delaware law may make an acquisition more difficult and could result in the entrenchment of management 
we are incorporated in delaware 
anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may make a change in control or efforts to remove management more difficult 
also  under delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures 
we have the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders 
if the board of directors exercises this power to issue preferred stock  it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock and vote the stock they acquire to remove management or directors 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws also provides staggered terms for the members of our board of directors 
under section of the delaware general corporation law  our directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause and only by vote of the holders of a majority of voting shares then outstanding 
these provisions may prevent stockholders from replacing the entire board in a single proxy contest  making it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions could also delay the removal of management by the board of directors with or without cause 
in addition  our directors may only be removed for cause and amended and restated bylaws limit the ability our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders 

table of contents under section of the delaware general corporation law  a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of or more of its capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless  among other possibilities  the board of directors approves the transaction 
our board of directors could use this provision to prevent changes in management 
the existence of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
we have the authority to issue up to million shares of preferred stock and to determine the terms of those shares of stock without any further action by our stockholders

under section of the delaware general corporation law  a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of or more of its capital stock until the holder has held the stock for three years unless  among other possibilities  the board of directors approves the transaction 
our board of directors could use this provision to prevent changes in management 
the existence of the foregoing provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
certain severance related agreements in our executive employment agreements may make an acquisition more difficult and could result in the entrenchment of management 
in march as subsequently amended  most recently as of january   we entered into employment agreements with our president and chief executive officer and our executive vice president  finance  chief financial officer and chief operating officer  which contain severance arrangements in the event that such executive s employment is terminated without cause or as a result of a change of control as each such term is defined in each agreement 
the financial obligations triggered by these provisions may prevent a business combination or acquisition that would be attractive to stockholders and could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for our stock 
in the event of an acquisition of our common stock  we cannot assure our common stockholders that we will be able to negotiate terms that would provide for a price equivalent to  or more favorable than  the price at which our shares of common stock may be trading at such time 
we may not effect a consolidation or merger with another entity without the vote or consent of the holders of at least a majority of the shares of our preferred stock in addition to the approval of our common stockholders  unless the preferred stock that remains outstanding and its rights  privileges and preferences are unaffected or are converted into or exchanged for preferred stock of the surviving entity having rights  preferences and limitations substantially similar  but no less favorable  to our convertible preferred stock 

table of contents in addition  in the event a third party seeks to acquire our company or acquire control of our company by way of a merger  but the terms of such offer do not provide for our preferred stock to remain outstanding or be converted into or exchanged for preferred stock of the surviving entity having rights  preferences and limitations substantially similar  but no less favorable  to our preferred stock  the terms of the certificate of designation of our preferred stock provide for an adjustment to the conversion ratio of our preferred stock such that  depending on the terms of any such transaction  preferred stockholders may be entitled  by their terms  to receive up to per share in common stock  causing our common stockholders not to receive as favorable a price as the price at which such shares may be trading at the time of any such transaction 
as of december   there were  shares of our preferred stock issued and outstanding 
if the transaction were one in which proceeds were received by the company for distribution to stockholders  and the terms of the certificate of designation governing the preferred stock were strictly complied with  approximately  would be paid to the preferred holders before any distribution to the common stockholders  although the form of transaction could affect how the holders of preferred stock are treated 
in such an event  although such a transaction would be subject to the approval of our holders of common stock  we cannot assure our common stockholders that we will be able to negotiate terms that would provide for a price equivalent to  or more favorable than  the price at which our shares of common stock may be trading at such time 
thus  the terms of our preferred stock might hamper a third party s acquisition of our company 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and certain provisions of delaware law may delay or prevent a change in our management and make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in our board of directors and management teams 
some of these provisions authorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval  commonly referred to as blank check preferred stock  with rights senior to those of our common stock  provide for the board of directors to be divided into three classes  and require that stockholder actions must be effected at a duly called stockholder meeting and prohibit stockholder action by written consent 
in addition  because we are incorporated in delaware  we are governed by the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which limits the ability of large stockholders to complete a business combination with  or acquisition of  us 
these provisions may prevent a business combination or acquisition that would be attractive to stockholders and could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for our stock 
these provisions also make it more difficult for our stockholders to replace members of our board of directors 
because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team  these provisions could in turn affect any attempt to replace our current management team 
additionally  these provisions may prevent an acquisition that would be attractive to stockholders and could limit the price that investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock 
we may have limited ability to pay cash dividends on our preferred stock  and there is no assurance that future quarterly dividends will be declared 
delaware law may limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our preferred stock 
under delaware law  cash dividends on our preferred stock may only be paid from surplus or  if there is no surplus  from the corporation s net profits for the current or preceding fiscal year 
delaware law defines surplus as the amount by which the total assets of a corporation  after subtracting its total liabilities  exceed the corporation s capital  as determined by its board of directors 
since we are not profitable  our ability to pay cash dividends will require the availability of adequate surplus 
even if adequate surplus is available to pay cash dividends on our preferred stock  we may not have sufficient cash to pay dividends on the convertible preferred stock or we may choose not to declare the dividends 
on february   we paid a quarterly cash dividend with respect to fourth quarter of fiscal year the board of directors considered numerous factors in determining whether to declare the quarterly dividend  including the requisite financial analysis and determination of a surplus 
while the board of directors will analyze the advisability of the declaration of dividends in future quarters  there is no assurance that future quarterly dividends will be declared 

table of contents we have not declared quarterly dividends on our preferred stock for a total of six quarterly dividend periods 
as a result  we will have to grant additional rights to our holders of preferred stock with respect to the management of the company 
although our board of directors declared the quarterly cash dividend with respect to the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which was paid on february   there are still dividends that have accrued and are unpaid on the preferred stock for at least six quarters 
as a result  the holders of our preferred stock are now entitled to nominate and elect two directors to the company s board of directors 
this right accrued to the preferred stockholders as of august  we held a special meeting of the holders of our preferred stock to elect two directors to our board of directors  which was adjourned because a quorum of the holders of our preferred stock was not present in person or represented by proxy to transact business at the meeting 
a quorum was not reached at such adjourned meeting either  and the meeting was not further adjourned 
the holders of our preferred stock will have the opportunity at our annual meeting of stockholders to elect two directors to our board of directors 
once elected  the directors elected by the preferred stockholders will have the ability to participate in the management of the company until all such dividends have been paid in full 
our common and convertible preferred stock may experience extreme price and volume fluctuations  which could lead to costly litigation for the company and make an investment in the company less appealing 
the market price of our common and convertible preferred stock may fluctuate substantially due to a variety of factors  including additions to or departures of our key personnel  announcements of technological innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors  announcements concerning our competitors or the biotechnology industry in general  new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines  general and industry specific economic conditions  changes in financial estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  variations in our quarterly results  announcements about our collaborators or licensors  and changes in accounting principles 
the market prices of the securities of biotechnology companies  particularly companies like us without product revenues and earnings  have been highly volatile and are likely to remain highly volatile in the future 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the performance of particular companies 
in the past  companies that experience volatility in the market price of their securities have often faced securities class action litigation 
moreover  market prices for stocks of biotechnology related and technology companies frequently reach levels that bear no relationship to the performance of these companies 
these market prices generally are not sustainable and are highly volatile 
whether or not meritorious  litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs  divert our management s attention and resources and harm our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  due to our stock price from time to time  we may not continue to qualify for continued listing on the nasdaq global market 
please see risk factor our common stock may have a volatile public trading price 

table of contents the future sale of our common and preferred stock and future issuances of our common stock upon conversion of our preferred stock  could negatively affect our stock price and cause dilution to existing holders of our common stock 
if our common or preferred stockholders sell substantial amounts of our stock in the public market  or the market perceives that such sales may occur  the market price of our common and preferred stock could fall 
for example  we were approached by a preferred stockholder that elected to convert  of its shares of preferred stock  which shares were converted into  shares of common stock in the first quarter of in addition   shares of preferred stock were converted to  shares of common stock during the second quarter of if additional holders of preferred stock elect to convert their shares to shares of common stock at renegotiated prices  such conversion as well as the sale of substantial amounts of our common or preferred stock  could cause dilution to existing holders of our common stock  thereby also negatively affecting the price of our common stock 
if we exchange the convertible preferred stock for debentures  the exchange will be taxable but we will not provide any cash to pay any tax liability that any convertible preferred stockholder may incur 
an exchange of convertible preferred stock for debentures  as well as any dividend make whole or interest make whole payments paid in our common stock  will be taxable events for united states federal income tax purposes  which may result in tax liability for the holder of convertible preferred stock without any corresponding receipt of cash by the holder 
in addition  the debentures may be treated as having original issue discount  a portion of which would generally be required to be included in the holder s gross income even though the cash to which such income is attributable would not be received until maturity or redemption of the debenture 
we will not distribute any cash to the holders of the securities to pay these potential tax liabilities 
if we automatically convert the convertible preferred stock  there is a substantial risk of fluctuation in the price of our common stock from the date we elect to automatically convert to the conversion date 
we may automatically convert the convertible preferred stock into common stock if the closing price of our common stock has exceeded 
there is a risk of fluctuation in the price of our common stock between the time when we may first elect to automatically convert the preferred and the automatic conversion date 
we do not intend to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future 
any payment of cash dividends will depend on our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  the outcome of the review of our strategic alternatives and other factors and will be at the discretion of our board of directors 
accordingly  investors will have to rely on capital appreciation  if any  to earn a return on their investment in our common stock 
furthermore  we may in the future become subject to contractual restrictions on  or prohibitions against  the payment of dividends 
the number of shares of common stock which are registered  including the shares to be issued upon exercise of our outstanding warrants  is significant in relation to our currently outstanding common stock and could cause downward pressure on the market price for our common stock 
the number of shares of common stock registered for resale  including those shares which are to be issued upon exercise of our outstanding warrants  is significant in relation to the number of shares of common stock currently outstanding 
if the security holder determines to sell a substantial number of shares into the market at any given time  there may not be sufficient demand in the market to purchase the shares without a decline in the market price for our common stock 
moreover  continuous sales into the market of a number of shares in excess of the typical trading volume for our common stock  or even the availability of such a large number of shares  could depress the trading market for our common stock over an extended period of time 

table of contents if persons engage in short sales of our common stock  including sales of shares to be issued upon exercise of our outstanding warrants  the price of our common stock may decline 
selling short is a technique used by a stockholder to take advantage of an anticipated decline in the price of a security 
in addition  holders of options and warrants will sometimes sell short knowing they can  in effect  cover through the exercise of an option or warrant  thus locking in a profit 
a significant number of short sales or a large volume of other sales within a relatively short period of time can create downward pressure on the market price of a security 
further sales of common stock issued upon exercise of our outstanding warrants could cause even greater declines in the price of our common stock due to the number of additional shares available in the market upon such exercise  which could encourage short sales that could further undermine the value of our common stock 
you could  therefore  experience a decline in the value of your investment as a result of short sales of our common stock 
we are exposed to risk related to the marketable securities we may purchase 
we may invest cash not required to meet short term obligations in short term marketable securities 
we may purchase securities in united states government  government sponsored agencies and highly rated corporate and asset backed securities subject to an approved investment policy 
historically  investment in these securities has been highly liquid and has experienced only very limited defaults 
however  recent volatility in the financial markets has created additional uncertainty regarding the liquidity and safety of these investments 
although we believe our marketable securities investments are safe and highly liquid  we cannot guarantee that our investment portfolio will not be negatively impacted by recent or future market volatility or credit restrictions

overview our clinical development priorities are focused on sapacitabine in the following indications acute myeloid leukemia  or aml  in the elderly  myelodysplastic syndromes  or mds  and non small cell lung cancer  or nsclc 
we have ongoing clinical programs in development awaiting further data 
once data become available and are reviewed  we will determine the feasibility of pursuing further development and or partnering these assets  including sapacitabine in combination with seliciclib  seliciclib in nsclc and nasopharyngeal cancer  or npc  and cyc in addition  we market directly in the united states xclair cream for radiation dermatitis and numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges for xerostomia 
our core area of expertise is in cell cycle biology and we focus primarily on the development of orally available anticancer agents that target the cell cycle with the aim of slowing the progression or shrinking the size of tumors  and enhancing the quality of life and improving survival rates of cancer patients 
we are generating several families of anticancer drugs that act on the cell cycle including nucleoside analogues  cyclin dependent kinase or cdk inhibitors and aurora kinase vascular endothelial factor receptor or ak vegfr inhibitors 
although a number of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are currently attempting to develop nucleoside analogues  cdk inhibitor and ak inhibitor drugs  we believe that our drug candidates are differentiated in that they are orally available and interact with unique target profiles and mechanisms 
for example we believe that our sapacitabine is the only orally available nucleoside analogue presently being tested in phase trial in aml and in phase for mds and seliciclib is the most advanced orally available cdk inhibitor currently in phase trials 
although our resources are primarily directed towards advancing our anticancer drug candidate sapacitabine through in house development activities we are also progressing  but with lower levels of investment than in previous years  our other novel drug series which are at earlier stages 
as a consequence of our continued focus on sapacitabine clinical development and related cost reduction program  research and development expenditures for the year ended december  decreased million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  research and development expenditures for the year ended december  were reduced by million  or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  
table of contents we have worldwide rights to commercialize sapacitabine  seliciclib and cyc and our business strategy is to enter into selective partnership arrangements with these programs 
taken together  our pipeline covers all four phases of the cell cycle  which we believe will improve the chances of successfully developing and commercializing novel drugs that work on their own or in combination with approved conventional chemotherapies or with other targeted drugs to treat human cancers 
our corporate headquarters is located in berkeley heights  new jersey  with a research facility located in dundee  scotland 
from our inception in through december   we have devoted substantially all our efforts and resources to our research and development activities 
we have incurred significant net losses since inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit during the development stage was approximately million 
we expect to continue incurring substantial losses for the next several years as we continue to develop our clinical and pre clinical drug candidates 
our operating expenses are comprised research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
to date  we have not generated significant product revenue but have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements  registered direct financings  licensing revenue  collaborations  interest on investments  government grants and research and development tax credits 
we have recognized revenues from inception through december  totaling approximately million  of which approximately million is derived from fees under collaborative agreements  approximately million of grant revenue from various united kingdom government grant awards  and approximately million from product sales 
we have also recognized million in research and development tax credits  which are reported as income tax benefits on the consolidated statements of operations  from the united kingdom s tax authority  hm revenue customs since inception 
recent events on february   we paid a quarterly cash dividend in the amount of per share on the company s convertible exchangeable preferred stock  or preferred stock 
the dividend was paid to the holders of record of the preferred stock as of the close business on january  the board of directors considered numerous factors in determining whether to declare the quarterly dividend  including the requisite financial analysis and determination of a surplus 
while the board of directors will analyze the advisability of the declaration of dividends in future quarters  there is no assurance that future quarterly dividends will be declared 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and compared to years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues the following table summarizes the components of our revenues for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands collaboration and research and development revenue product revenue grant revenue total revenue collaboration and research and development revenue in is derived from an agreement with a pharmaceutical company under which we provided one of our compounds for evaluation 
no revenue was recognized under collaborative agreements during and product revenue is derived from the sale of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges following the align asset acquisition on october  during the years ended december   and  we recognized approximately million  million  and million in revenues  respectively 
the decrease in product revenue for the year ended december  versus that in the prior year was due to a higher than anticipated amount of product returns approximating million  related to expiring product with a two year shelf life previously sold into the marketplace 
additionally  we increased our provisions for product returns and have fully reserved against shipped products approaching and within six months of expiration 
additionally  we increased our provisions for product returns and have fully reserved against shipped products approaching and within six months of expiration 
grant revenue is recognized as we incur and pay for qualifying costs and services under the applicable grant 
grant revenue is primarily derived from various united kingdom government and european union grant awards 
for the years ended  and  we had grant revenue of   and  respectively 
the increase in was as a result of finalizing a three year european union grant which concluded in the future this was the third full year of align product sales since we acquired align in october we expect to continue to maintain the sales of align products in through the support of a small sales and marketing infrastructure 
we do not expect grant revenue to increase over the next months as no awards are expected in this period 
cost of goods sold years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands cost of goods sold 
table of contents cost of goods sold includes the cost of align products that have been delivered to our customers and for which revenues have been recognized 
the reduction in the cost of sales in was due to lower product revenues 
total cost of goods sold represented and of product revenue for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the cost of sales for the year ended december  represented of product revenues and in the future we expect to maintain a similar margin level as we incurred in research and development expenses from our inception  we have focused on drug discovery and development programs  with particular emphasis on orally available anticancer agents and our research and development expenses have represented costs incurred to discover and develop novel small molecule therapeutics  including clinical trial costs for sapacitabine  seliciclib  sapacitabine in combination with seliciclib and cyc we have also incurred costs in the advancement of product candidates toward clinical and pre clinical trials and the development of in house research to advance our biomarker program and technology platforms 
however  during and  in response to changing market conditions  we extensively reduced or stopped expenditure on development and preclinical activities outside of our core focus on sapacitabine 
the benefit of these cost reductions has been realized in and we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
research and development expenses primarily include clinical trial and regulatory related costs  payroll and personnel related expenses  including consultants and contract research  preclinical studies and laboratory supplies and materials  technology license costs  and rent and facility expenses for our laboratories

fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development costs decreased by  or approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  approximately million was due to closing out of all programs other than sapacitabine 
research and development costs associated with the sapacitabine program decreased by approximately million due largely to capsule manufacture costs incurred in that were not necessary in 
table of contents fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development costs decreased by  or approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  starting in september with our announced cost containment efforts  we reduced or eliminated costs of all programs other than sapacitabine clinical trials and  as a result  the research and development costs were reduced by approximately million in from sapacitabine program costs increased by approximately million due to the increase in clinical trial costs of running the aml and mds programs 
the future we will continue to concentrate our resources on the development of sapacitabine 
we anticipate that overall research and development expenditures in will increase as we enroll the seamless pivotal phase trial 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include costs for sales and marketing operations  administrative personnel  legal and other professional expenses and general corporate expenses 
the following table summarizes the total selling  general and administrative expenses for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands total selling  general and administrative expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses represented  and of our operating expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  or million  to million for the year ended december   from approximately million for the year ended december  this was primarily due to increased consultancy and professional costs of approximately million  an increase in stock compensation costs of million  and an increase in legal costs of million 
this was partially offset by reductions in employment related costs of million and intellectual property costs of million 
fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenditure decreased by  or million  from approximately million for the year ended december  to approximately million for the year ended december  this was as a result of cost saving measures first established in september and then during the second and third quarters of the cost savings resulted from reductions in employment related costs of million  intellectual property expenditures of million  stock based compensation expenses of million  professional fees of million  investor relations costs of million  information technology costs of million and travel costs of million 
additionally  sales and marketing costs related to align in were reduced by million compared to  which included one time business launch costs not repeated in the future we expect our selling  general and administrative expenditures in to remain at the same level or to be less than our expenditures in 
table of contents goodwill and intangible asset impairment the following table summarizes the goodwill and intangibles impairment charges for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands goodwill and intangibles impairment in september  the goodwill acquired in the xcyte transaction was written down in full and we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million in accordance with accounting standard codification  or asc  intangibles goodwill and other  or asc this impairment charge was identified through our annual impairment review process and was triggered primarily by a decline in our stock price that reduced our market capitalization below book value of the net assets of the xcyte reporting unit 
our reduced market capitalization reflected the general decline in the economic environment 
intangible assets acquired in the align transaction were also fully written down in september  in accordance with asc  codification topic  entitled property  plant and equipment  or asc an impairment charge of approximately million was recognized on the consolidated statement of operations 
this one time non cash charge was triggered by a downwards revision of our projected net cash flows from product sales  required due to budgetary constraints experienced by health care providers and restrictions of the cost reimbursement regime 
as a result  the sum of the expected undiscounted cash flows was less than the carrying amount of the asset group comprising the intangible assets on september  in december  goodwill allocated to our align reporting unit following the align acquisition was fully written down in accordance with asc  resulting in an impairment charge of approximately million being recognized on the consolidated statement of operations 
a further decline in our stock price during the fourth quarter of caused us to perform an impairment analysis during december in determining the impairment charge  we considered the negative impact the current economic situation might have on sales growth expectations of the align products resulting in a downward revisions of projected net cash flows from product sales 
these factors caused the fair value of the reporting unit to be less than its carrying value on december   leading to a write down of the goodwill residing in that reporting unit 
the future previously recognized goodwill and intangible assets acquired have been fully impaired as of december  accordingly  there can be no further write downs of these assets in restructuring charge the following table summarizes the restructuring charges for years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands total restructuring charge 
table of contents fiscal as compared to fiscal there was no restructuring charge for the year ended december   as compared to a charge of million for the year ended december  during  we reduced our workforce by twenty six people as part of a revision of our operating plan to concentrate our resources on the advancement of our lead drug  sapacitabine 
there were no such reductions in fiscal as compared to fiscal the restructuring charge decreased by or million from approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in september  we began revising our operating plan to concentrate our resources on the advancement of our lead drug  sapacitabine  while maintaining a core competency in drug discovery and cell cycle biology 
the plan initially reduced our workforce across all locations by people 
we recorded and paid approximately million of severance costs and million of accelerated depreciation for assets that will no longer be utilized 
in addition we accrued a charge of million in respect of costs of exiting the lease of our redundant cambridge  england  research facility 
the future during the fourth quarter of  we did not renew the lease on a manufacturing facility in bothell  washington 
we have met all our obligations against the lease and there will be no further accretion expense associated with the restructuring liability 
revisions to our operating plan  if any  will be assessed as circumstances dictate

the differences related to these items are explained further below 
change in valuation of warrants liability the change in valuation of warrants relates to the issue of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock under the registered direct financing completed in february the warrants issued to the investors are classified as and are being accounted for as a liability 
the value of the warrants is being marked to market each reporting period as a derivative gain or loss until exercised or expiration 
for each of the years ended december  and  we recognized an expense of approximately million in the change in the value of warrants 
foreign exchange gain loss in conjunction with the operational review conducted by the company in september  the nature of intercompany funding was considered 
it was concluded that as repayment of intercompany loans is not expected in the foreseeable future  the nature of the funding advanced was of a long term investment nature and that the terms of the loans should be amended to reflect this 
effective october   intercompany loans ceased to be repayable on demand and have no fixed repayment date 
as a result of the change in repayment terms  from october   all unrealized foreign exchange gains or losses arising on the intercompany loans are recognized in other comprehensive income on the consolidated statement of stockholders equity until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
for the year ended december   unfavorable unrealized foreign exchange movements related to intercompany loans recorded in other comprehensive income totaled million compared to favorable unrealized foreign exchange movements of million in foreign exchange gains losses not related to intercompany loans are recorded in income expense 
foreign exchange gain loss was a  expense for the year ended december   compared to a  expense for the year ended december  
table of contents interest income interest income decreased by approximately  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  during  maturing short term investments were reinvested in cash and cash equivalents  being a more secure form of investment and providing greater liquidity 
as a result  these assets attracted a lower rate of interest 
this was compounded by a reduction in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments during as compared to interest expense interest expense decreased by  from  for year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this is due largely to the reduction in accretion expense associated with the bothell restructuring lease  which expired in december for each of the years ended december  and  we recorded accretion expense associated with the bothell restructuring lease of  and  respectively 
fiscal as compared to fiscal total other income expense  net  reduced by approximately million from a gain million in to an expense of million in due to the reduction in interest income of million arising form lower yields available on lower average interest bearing cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million in the valuation of warrants liability and million in respect of a payment under guarantee related to our arrangement with scottish enterprise 
this increase in expense was offset by a reduction in foreign exchange losses of million in compared to the differences related to these items are explained further below 
change in valuation of warrants liability the change in valuation of warrants relates to the issue of warrants to purchase shares of our common stock under the registered direct financing completed in february the warrants issued to the investors are classified as and are being accounted for as a liability 
the value of the warrants is being marked to market each reporting period as a derivative gain or loss until exercised or expiration 
for the year ended december   we recorded a gain of approximately million in the change in the value of warrants 
for the year ended december   we recognized an expense of approximately million as the change in the value of warrants 
foreign exchange gain loss for the year ended december  favorable unrealized foreign exchange movements recorded in other comprehensive income totaled million compared to unfavorable foreign exchange movements of million in foreign exchange gains losses not related to intercompany loans are recorded in income expense in the year ended december  which totaled million expense compared to a million of expense in  of which million related to unrealized foreign exchange losses arising on the intercompany loans charged to this category before the october  change offset by a realized gain of million on transactions in the year in respect of underlying operations 
interest income during  maturing short term investments were reinvested in cash and cash equivalents  being a more secure form of investment and providing greater liquidity 
as a result  these assets attracted a lower rate of interest 
this was compounded by a reduction in the average balance of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments during as compared to interest expense interest expense decreased approximately million  from million for year ended december  to million for the year ended december  for the years ended december  and  we recorded accretion expense associated with the bothell restructuring lease of million and million  respectively on the consolidated statement of operations as interest expense 

table of contents the future the valuation of the warrants liability will continue to be re measured at the end of each reporting period 
the valuation of the warrants is dependent upon many factors  including our stock price  interest rates and the remaining term of the instrument and may fluctuate significantly  which may have a significant impact on our statement of operations 
as the nature of funding advanced through intercompany loans is that of a long term investment in nature  future unrealized foreign exchange gains and losses on such funding will be recognized in other comprehensive income until repayment of the intercompany loan becomes foreseeable 
this will minimize the future impact of unrealized foreign exchange fluctuations on earnings 
income tax benefit credit is taken for research and development tax credits  which are claimed from the united kingdom s taxation and customs authority  in respect of qualifying research and development costs incurred 
the following table summarizes research and development tax credits for the years ended december   and years ended differences differences to to to to in thousands total income tax benefit fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development tax credits recoverable decreased by  or approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended to approximately million for the year ended december  the level of tax credits recoverable is linked directly to qualifying research and development expenditure incurred in any one year but restricted to payroll taxes paid by us in the united kingdom in that same year 
the decrease is a reflection of decreased income taxes available for recovery as a consequence of the lower eligible research and development payroll expenses in the united kingdom following the workforce reductions commenced in september and continued in fiscal as compared to fiscal research and development tax credits recoverable decreased by  or approximately million  from approximately million for the year ended to approximately million for the year ended december  the level of tax credits recoverable is linked directly to qualifying research and development expenditure incurred in any one year but restricted to payroll taxes paid by us in the united kingdom in that same year 
the decrease was a reflection of decreased income taxes available for recovery as a consequence of the lower eligible research and development payroll expenses in the united kingdom following the workforce reductions commenced in september and continued in the second and third quarters of the future we expect to continue to be eligible to receive united kingdom research and development tax credits for the foreseeable future and will elect to do so 
however  as a result of our revised operating plan announced in september and the subsequent reduction in workforce in the amount of payroll taxes payable in future periods will be lower than in previous periods  restricting available income tax credits to that lower amount

since our inception  we have not generated any significant product revenues and have relied primarily on the proceeds from sales of common and preferred equity securities  as well as warrants  to finance our operations and internal growth 
additional funding has come through interest on investments  licensing revenue  government grants and research and development tax credits 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we believe that existing funds together with cash generated from operations and recent financing activities are sufficient to satisfy our planned working capital  capital expenditures and other financial commitments for at least the next twelve months 
current business and capital market risks could have a detrimental effect on the availability of sources of funding and our ability to access them in the future which may delay or impede our progress of advancing our drugs currently in the clinic to approval by the fda for commercialization

net cash used in operating activities decreased by million  from million in to million in our net cash used in operating activities significantly decreased primarily as a result of our cost reduction plan first implemented in september and then again during june of and the focus to advancing sapacitabine into a pivotal phase trial 
net cash used in operating activities during the year ended december  of million resulted from our net operating loss of million  adjusted for material non cash activities comprised of the change in valuation of liability classified warrants  depreciation and amortization  fixed asset impairment  and non cash stock based compensation expense  amounting to million and a net increase of million due to a decrease in prepaid expenses and other current assets combined with a net increase in accounts payable and other current liabilities 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities in the year ended december  amounted to  during the year ended december   cash provided by investing activities amounted to million 
during  the proceeds from maturing short term investments were reinvested in cash and cash equivalents to reduce our risk profile 
in addition  the net proceeds from million of maturing short term investments were used to fund our operating activities 
capital expenditure was reduced to  for the year ended december  compared to expenditures of  for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased by million  from a source of million for the year ended december  to a source of million for the year ended december  for the year ended december  the net cash provided by financing activities increased primarily due to the completion of a private placement of approximately million in net proceeds during october  the two registered direct offerings in january for net proceeds of approximately million  the issuing of million common shares for approximately million as part of the ceff with kingsbridge capital limited  or kingsbridge and the exercise of options and warrants totaling million during for year ended december   the net cash provided by financing activities of million related primarily to net proceeds received from the registered direct offering of million in july on december   we entered into a ceff with kingsbridge  which was subsequently amended on november   in which kingsbridge committed to purchase the lesser of  shares of common stock or million of common stock from us over a three year period 
the ceff expired on december  
table of contents during december we sold an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to kingsbridge under the terms of the ceff in consideration of an aggregate of million 
for the year ended december   the net cash outflow for financing activities primarily related to the payment of our preferred stock dividend of million 
operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
while we have generated modest product revenues from align product sales for the years ended december   and  we cannot guarantee that we will generate any significant product revenues until a product candidate has been approved by the fda or similar regulatory agencies in other countries and successfully commercialized 
we currently anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months 
we cannot be certain that any of our programs will be successful or that we will be able to raise sufficient funds to complete the development and commercialize any of our product candidates currently in development  should they succeed 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate in licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain access to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy 
any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials  preclinical studies and other discovery and research and development activities  the costs associated with establishing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities  the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses  product candidates and technologies  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the economic and other terms and timing of any collaboration  licensing or other arrangements into which we may enter 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or strategic collaborations 
although we are not reliant on institutional credit finance and therefore not subject to debt covenant compliance requirements or potential withdrawal of credit by banks  the current economic climate has also impacted the availability of funds and activity in equity markets 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or research and development programs or make changes to our operating plan similar to the revision made in september in addition  we may have to partner one or more of our product candidate programs at an earlier stage of development  which would lower the economic value of those programs to us 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the judgments and estimates required by the following accounting policies to be critical in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition product sales we have adopted the following revenue recognition policy related to the sales of xclair cream  numoisyn liquid and numoisyn lozenges 
we recognize revenue from these product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we offer a general right of return on these product sales and account for all product sales using the sell through method 
under the sell through method  revenue is not recognized upon shipment of product to distributors 
instead  we record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price and deferred cost of sales at the cost at which those goods were held in inventory 
we recognize revenue when such inventory is sold through to pharmacies 
to estimate product sold through to pharmacies  we rely on third party information  including information obtained from significant distributors with respect to their inventory levels and sell through to pharmacies 
for  we recorded million of product returns due to a higher than anticipated amount of returns 
from the first quarter of  our supplier has increased the product shelf life to three years on one of our products to assist us in the management of the product supply chain 
collaboration  research and development  and grant revenue certain of our revenues are earned from collaborative agreements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
determination of whether these criteria have been met is based on management s judgments regarding the nature of the research performed  the substance of the milestones met relative to those we must still perform  and the collectability of any related fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
research and development revenues  which are earned under agreements with third parties for contract research and development activities  are recorded as the related services are performed 
milestone payments are non refundable and recognized as revenue when earned  as evidenced by achievement of the specified milestones and the absence of ongoing performance obligations 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue 
none of the revenues recognized to date are refundable if the relevant research effort is not successful 
grant revenues from government agencies and private research foundations are recognized as the related qualified research and development costs are incurred  up to the limit of the prior approved funding amounts 
grant revenues are not refundable 

table of contents stock based compensation we grant stock options  restricted stock units and restricted stock to officers  employees  directors and consultants under the company s amended and restated equity incentive plan  which was amended and restated as of april  we also have outstanding options under various stock based compensation plans for employees and directors 
we measure compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on date of grant and recognize compensation over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the determination of grant date fair value for stock option awards is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  the anticipated exercise behavior of our employees  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for share based payments 
such value is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line attribution method 
the estimation of stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment  and to the extent actual results or updated estimates differ from our current estimates  such amounts are recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 
during the second  third and fourth quarters of  we revised downward the forfeiture rates on certain stock options granted mostly due to the high probability of those options becoming fully vested over the next twelve months  which resulted in an additional expense of million 
during the quarter ended march   we revised the forfeiture rates because actual forfeiture rates were higher than those previously estimated primarily due to the lapsing of stock option grants on the termination of employees 
the revision to past forfeiture estimates for the three months ended march  resulted in a reversal of stock based compensation cost recognized in prior years with a consequent net gain of approximately million on the consolidated statement of operations 
during each of the quarters ended september  and june   we revised the forfeiture rates because actual forfeiture rates were higher than those previously estimated primarily due to the lapsing of stock option grants on the termination of employees 
for the nine months ended september   we recognized a net cumulative credit of approximately million with respect to the revised forfeiture rates 
related to the workforce reduction in the second and third quarters of  we amended the exercise period in which the employees would be able to exercise their vested stock options from thirty days post termination date to nine months 
in addition  we allowed the individuals to continue to vest stock options until november  as if they were still employed in recognition of past work 
per asc  we considered this a type iii modification and thus we recorded stock based compensation expense of million during the second and third quarters of warrants liability february financing asc  derivatives and hedging asc requires freestanding contracts that are settled in our own stock  including common stock warrants to be designated as equity instruments  assets or liabilities 
under the provisions of asc  a contract designated as an asset or a liability must be carried at fair value until exercised or expired  with any changes in fair value recorded in the results of operations 
a contract designated as an equity instrument must be included within equity  and no subsequent fair value adjustments are required 
we review the classification of the contracts at each balance sheet date 
pursuant to asc  since we are unable to control all the events or actions necessary to settle the warrants in registered shares the warrants have been recorded as a current liability at fair value 
the fair value of the outstanding warrants is evaluated at each reporting period with any resulting change in the fair value being reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded a charge of approximately million to reflect the change in fair value for each of the years ended december  and december  fair value is estimated using an option pricing model  which includes variables such as the expected volatility of our share price  interest rates  and dividend yields 
these variables are projected based on our historical data  experience  and other factors 
changes in any of these variables could result in material adjustments to the expense recognized for changes in the valuation of the warrants liability
