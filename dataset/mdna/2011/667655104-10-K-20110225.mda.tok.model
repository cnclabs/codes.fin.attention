item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s assessment of northwest natural gas company s nw natural financial condition  including the principal factors that affect results of operations 
the discussion refers to our consolidated activities for the years ended december    and unless otherwise indicated  references in this discussion to notes are to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this report 
the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of nw natural and its direct and indirect wholly owned subsidiaries which include gill ranch storage  llc gill ranch  nw natural energy  llc nwn energy  nw natural gas storage  llc nwn gas storage  and nng financial corporation nng financial 
these statements also include accounts related to an equity investment in palomar gas holdings  llc pgh  which is developing a proposed natural gas pipeline through its wholly owned subsidiary palomar gas transmission llc palomar 
these accounts include our regulated local gas distribution business  our gas storage business  and other regulated and non regulated investments primarily in energy related businesses 
in this report  the term utility is used to describe our regulated local gas distribution se gment distribution  and the term non utility is used to describe our gas storage segment gas storage as well as our other regulated and non regulated investments and business activities other segment 
for a further discussion of our business segments  see note in addition to presenting results of operations and earnings amounts in total  certain measures are expressed in cents per share 
these amounts reflect factors that directly impact earnings 
we believe this per share information is useful because it enables readers to better understand the impact of these factors on consolidated earnings 
all references in this section to earnings per share are on the basis of diluted shares 
we also show operating revenues and margins excluding the refund of gas cost savings to customers in june and july because we believe it provides a more meaningful comparison of operating revenues and margins between and we also present free cash flow see cash flows financing activities  below 
we use such non gaap ie non generally accepted accounting principles measures in analyzing our financial performance and believe that they provide useful information to our investors and creditors in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary highlights of include consolidated earnings of million and per share in compared to million and in  operating revenues margin of million  a decrease of percent  total operating expenses of million  a decrease of percent  interest expense of million  minus other income of million  for a net decrease of percent  cash flow from operations of million  a decrease of million  gill ranch gas storage facility completed and operations started up in the fourth quarter of  utility customer growth rate of percent in  compared to percent in  a overall ranking for the best gas utility in the nation on the jd power and associates residential customer satisfaction survey  and a ranking for best in the west on the business customer satisfaction survey  and dividends paid increased percent to per share in  making this the th consecutive year of increasing dividends paid to shareholders 
our primary businesses consist of regulated utility and gas storage operations 
factors critical to the success of the utility include maintaining a safe and reliable distribution system  acquiring an adequate supply of natural gas  providing distribution services at competitive prices  and being able to recover our operating and capital costs in the rates charged to customers in a reasonable and timely manner 
our utility business is regulated by two state commissions  the public utility commission of oregon opuc and the washington utilities and transportation commission wutc 
factors critical to the success of our gas storage business include developing and operating storage capacity at competitive market prices  retaining existing customers and successfully marketing available storage capacity to new custom ers  planning for the replacement of capacity that is expected to be recalled by the utility to serve growing demands of its customers  appropriate rates  and with respect to future development of gas storage projects  being able to obtain financing to fund future development 
our gas storage business is  in part  regulated by the california public utilities commission cpuc 

table of contents outlook in  we intend to remain focused on improving our core businesses  enhancing our strategic position  advancing business development projects related to our primary business segments  and strengthening our organizational effectiveness 
the following is a brief summary of management s plans and objectives in these four areas 
for further information  see issues  challenges and performance measures  and strategic opportunities  below 
business improvements 
we continue to develop  integrate  consolidate and streamline operations using recently acquired new technology  which include an enterprise resource planning system  an automated dispatching system and an automated meter reading system 
these and other new technologies support our operating model 
strategic position 
we remain committed to creating shareholder value while balancing the interests of our customers  employees and the communities we serve 
to create value  we anticipate and respond to business challenges and opportunities that lie ahead  including finding innovative solutions to economic and environmental challenges as well as regulatory  workforce and business development challenges and opportunities  such as the potential investment in long term gas reserves on behalf of our utility customers 
business development 
we continue to focus on the development of our underground gas storage businesses  the natural gas infrastructure investment in palomar and key utility initiatives 
organizational effectiveness 
our employees are our most valued resource 
we intend to support our employees with a positive and safe work environment  on going training opportunities  continued refinement of our organizational structure and new technologies to achieve goals and facilitate improvements 
issues  challenges and performance measures economic weakness 
ongoing weakness in local and us economies has continued to impact utility customer growth  business demand for natural gas and gas storage prices 
most recently  our utility s annual customer growth rate increased slightly to percent at december   compared to percent in and percent in we are still faced with to percent unemployment rates in oregon and southwest washington and a sluggish business environment 
however  despite these challenges we believe we are well positioned to continue adding utility customers due to lower natural gas prices  our relatively low market penetration  our efforts to convert homes to natural gas  and the potential for environmental initiatives th at could favor natural gas use in our region 
managing gas prices and supplies 
our gas acquisition strategy is designed to secure sufficient supplies of natural gas to meet the needs of our utility customers and to hedge gas prices to effectively manage costs  reduce price volatility and maintain a competitive advantage 
with recent success in new drilling technologies and substantial new supplies from shale gas formations around the us and in canada  the supply of north american natural gas has increased dramatically  which has contributed to lower and more stable gas prices 
we entered the gas contract year  which began november   hedged on gas commodity prices at approximately percent of our forec asted purchase volumes 
in addition  we are currently hedged at approximately percent for the gas contract year and between and percent for the gas contract year 
our purchased gas adjustment pga mechanism  along with our gas price hedging strategies and gas supplies in storage  enable us to reduce earnings risk exposure and secure lower gas costs for customers 
these lower gas prices  coupled with good customer service and energy efficiency programs for customers  can help strengthen natural gas competitive price advantage compared to other fuels 
in addition to hedging gas prices over the next few years  we are evaluating and developing other gas acquisition strategies to potentially manage gas price volatility for customers beyond three years  including possible investment in long term gas reserves 
although stable gas prices provide opportunities to manage costs for our distribution customers  they present challenges for our gas storage business by lowering the value of  and reducing demand for  storage services and limiting gill ranch s ability to contract for longer terms at favorable prices 

table of contents environmental costs 
we accrue all material environmental loss contingencies related to our properties that require environmental investigation or remediation 
due to numerous uncertainties surrounding the preliminary nature of investigations or the developing nature of remediation requirements  actual costs could vary significantly from our loss estimates 
as a regulated utility  we are required to defer certain costs pursuant to regulatory decisions 
we currently have a regulatory order to defer certain environmental costs  and to seek recovery of these amounts in future rates to customers 
however  before we can seek recovery from customers  we are expected to pursue recovery from insurance policies 
ultimate recovery of environmental costs  either from regulated utility rates or from insurance  will depend on our ability to effectively manage costs and demonstrate that costs were prudently incurred 
recovery may vary significantly from amounts currently recorded as regulatory assets  and amounts not recovered would be required to be charged to income in the period they were deemed to be unrecoverable 
see note climate change 
we recognize that our businesses will be impacted by future carbon constraints 
the outcome of federal  state  local and international climate change initiatives cannot be determined at this time  but these initiatives could produce a number of results including potential new regulations  additional charges to fund energy efficiency activities  or other regulatory actions 
for example  in september  the epa issued a final rule requiring the annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from certain industries  specified large greenhouse gas emission sources  and facilities that emit  metric tons or more of co equivalents per year 
the first reports are due by march  for emissions occurring on or after january  under this reporting rule  local gas distribution companies are required to report system throughput to the epa on an annual basis 
the epa also issued additional greenhouse gas reporting regulations in november requiring the annual reporting of fugitive emissions  an unintended release of gas  from our operations 
the first report under these more recent regulations is due by march  lawsuits have been filed challenging the epa s regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and members of the us congress have discussed proposing legislation that would limit the epa s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions 
while our co equivalent emission levels are relatively small  the adoption and implementation of any regulations imposing reporting obligations  or limiting emiss ions of greenhouse gases associated with our operations  could result in an increase in the prices we charge our customers or a decline in the demand for natural gas 
on the other hand  because natural gas has a relatively low carbon content  it is also possible that future carbon constraints could create additional demand for natural gas for electric generation  direct use in homes and businesses and as a reliable and relatively low emission back up fuel source for alternative energy sources 
performance measures 
in order to deal with the challenges affecting our businesses  we annually review and update our strategic plan to map our course over the next several years 
our plan includes strategies for further improving our utility gas distribution business  growing our non utility gas storage business  investing in new natural gas infrastructure in the region  and maintaining a leadership role within the gas utility industry by addressing long term energy policies and pursuing business opportunities that support new clean energy technologies 
we intend to measure our performance and monitor progress on certain metrics including  but not limited to earnings per share growth  total shareholder return  return on invested capital  utility return on e quity  utility customer satisfaction ratings  utility margin  utility capital and operations and maintenance expense per customer  and non utility earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization non utility ebitda 
strategic opportunities business process improvements 
to address the current economic and competitive challenges  we continue to evaluate and implement business strategies to improve efficiencies 
our goal is to develop  integrate  consolidate and streamline operations and support our employees with new technology tools 
in  we announced a voluntary severance program to reduce staffing levels in response to work load declines related to the low customer growth environment and efficiency improvements 
severance programs and normal attrition resulted in reductions of full time positions from  at december  to slightly over  in  and the savings are reflected in decreases in utility operation and maintenance costs and utility capital expenditures 
technology investments  workforce reductions and other initiatives implemented over the last couple years contributed to a percent decrease in utility operation and maintenance cost in  and these efforts are expected to contribute to long term operational efficiencies and lower operating and capital costs throughout nw natural 

table of contents gas storage development 
we have a joint agreement with pacific gas and electric company pg e on an underground natural gas storage facility near fresno  california 
our percent undivided ownership interest in the facility is held by our wholly owned subsidiary  gill ranch 
gill ranch is also the sole operator of the project 
construction on this facility began in january  with a majority of the construction work completed by october and the remainder of the construction work expected to be completed in our share of the initial development is designed to provide bcf of gas storage capacity by the end of and an associated capacity on the approximate miles of gas transmission pipeline 
gill ranch began operations during the fourth quarter of see note gill ranch is offering storage services to the california market at market based rates  subject to cpuc regulation including  but not limited to  service terms and conditions  tariff regulations  and security issuances 
due to increasing supplies and price stability of natural gas in north america  and declining demand for natural gas due to recent economic conditions  current storage values are expected to remain low in the near term  which will likely affect the prices at which gill ranch is able to contract 
the initial construction costs of gill ranch included the construction of some infrastructure that will accommodate a potential expansion of the gill ranch facility 
subject to market demand  project execution  available financing and receipt of future permits  we have the operational capacity to expand the gill ranch facility beyond our and pg e s combined permitted capacity of bcf  without further expansion of our takeaway pipeline system 
taking these considerations into account and with certain infrastructure modifications  we currently estimate that the gill ranch storage facility could support an aggregate storage capacity of around bcf  of which we would have the rights to an aggregate of bcf or percent of total estimated storage capacity 
the pacific northwest storage markets also are negatively impacted by lower gas prices and lack of gas price volatility  but less so than in california 
in  we expect to continue planning for possible expansion of our gas storage facilities near mist  oregon in anticipation of increased natural gas demand for electric generation in the pacific northwest 
currently we do not have a set timeline for development  but we believe the earliest timeframe for moving forward with the next mist expansion is in the meantime  we will continue to monitor the market demand and work on preliminary design and project scope  which will ultimately require the development of storage wells  potentially a second compression station and additional pipeline gathering facilities that will  enable future storage expansions 
pipeline diversification 
currently our utility and gas storage at mist depend on a single bi directional interstate transmission pipeline to ship gas supplies 
palomar  a wholly owned subsidiary of pgh  seeks to build a new gas transmission pipeline that would provide an interconnection with our utility distribution system 
pgh is owned percent by us and percent by gas transmission northwest corporation gtn  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of transcanada corporation 
the proposed palomar pipeline includes an east and a west segment and is designed to serve our utility and the growing natural gas markets in oregon and other parts of the pacific northwest 
the proposed pipeline would be regulated by the ferc 
in may  we learned that the company proposing to build an lng terminal on the columbia river had suspended its operations and filed for bankruptcy 
this company had previously entered into a binding precedent agreement with palomar for a majority of the proposed pipeline s capacity 
in september  the bankruptcy court rejected and terminated the precedent agreement and ruled in palomar s favor with regards to a lien on the bankrupt company s assets 
palomar currently has taken title to all of the bankrupt shipper s assets based upon the bankruptcy court s final decision in this matter in october palomar also has a non binding memorandum of understanding with the williams companies northwest pipeline northwest pipeline that contemplates northwest pipeline becoming a part owner in the palomar project and which consolidates the region s efforts to develop a cross cascades pipeline around the use of the palomar route 
northwest pipeline owns and operates the single  bi directional pipeline that connects to nw natural s utility distribution system 
in early february  palomar held a workshop with the opuc  wutc and other pacific northwest parties to address the aggregate gas infrastructure needs for the region 
palomar expects to have an open season in and focus on permitting activities with ferc during the date for when the palomar pipeline is expected to go into s ervice will be impacted by the timing of our final ferc permit and the needs of shippers 
see financial condition cash flows investing activities  below for further discussion on the status of palomar 

table of contents as of december   our net equity investment in pgh  which in turn has been invested in palomar  was million 
as of december   palomar had invested a total of million of capital costs for the pipeline development  including allowance for funds used during construction afudc 
palomar recovered million from a letter of credit which supported the bankrupt shipper s obligations under its prior precedent agreement  and title to certain assets from the bankrupt company s liquidation 
in october  palomar executed an agreement with the confederated tribe of the warm springs reservation that provides tribal consent for the bureau of indian affairs to issue a pipeline right of way grant across the warm springs reservation 
adoption of this route for the east segment will both shorten the pipeline length and reduce its environmental impact relative to the initially proposed route in palomar s ferc application 
we believe the proposed pipeline s east segment is still a viable project  and the palomar project remains in a development stage 
we performed an impairment analysis for our total equity investment as of december  and determined that no impairment write down is needed see note 
consolidated earnings and dividends consolidated net income was million  or per share  for the year ended december   compared to million  or per share  and million  or per share  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
consolidated earnings decreased in fiscal year primarily due to lower earnings from our gas storage segment  which reflects partial year operations and start up expenses for our subsidiaries gill ranch and nwn gas storage 
these decreases were partially offset by increased earnings reported by our utility gas distribution business and our ongoing interstate gas storage business at mist 
consolidated returns on average stockholders equity for these three years were percent  percent and percent  respectively 
compared to the most significant factors contributing to the million decrease in consolidated net income were a million decrease in utility net operating revenue margin from the regulatory gas cost incentive sharing mechanism  which reflects gains of million in compared to gains of million in a million net loss from gill ranch  and a million net loss from nwn gas storage  primarily reflecting higher operating expenses related to start up activities  a million increase in income tax expense primarily reflecting higher taxable income from the utility  including an accelerated amortization of regulatory tax balances related to pre assets which are offset by increased revenues collected in utility margin  and a million increase in interest expense primarily reflecting the full year effect of long term debt issued during and higher balances of short term debt outstanding 
partially offsetting the above factors were a million increase in utility margin from residential and commercial customers  after adjustments for weather and decoupling mechanisms  primarily due to colder weather benefits in the second quarter of when weather normalization was not in effect  customer growth and the rate recovery of higher income tax expenses related to an increase in oregon tax rates and the accelerated amortization of regulatory tax assets  a million decrease in utility operating expenses primarily due to lower property tax  payroll  bad debt  and employee benefit costs  and a million increase in other income primarily due to higher interest income from utility deferred regulatory account balances and interest income from a utility property tax refund  partially offset by a decrease in the non utility gains from company owned life insurance 

table of contents compared to factors contributing to increased earnings were a million increase in utility margin from our regulatory share of gas cost savings  reflecting a contribution to margin of million in compared to a reduction to margin of million in  a million increase in utility margin from the regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid  and a million increase in gas storage margin from higher optimization revenues 
partially offsetting the above factors were a million increase in operations and maintenance expense primarily due to higher utility expenses for pensions  bonuses  health care benefits and employee severance  a million increase in income tax expense related to higher taxable income and a higher state income tax rate  and a million decrease in utility margin from industrial customers  reflecting weak economic conditions and a decrease in depreciation rates 
dividends paid on our common stock were per share in  compared to per share in and per share in the board of directors declared a quarterly dividend on our common stock of cents per share  payable on february   increasing the indicated annual dividend rate to per share 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our financial statements using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap  management exercises judgment in the selection and application of accounting principles  including making estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures in the financial statements 
management considers our critical accounting policies to be those which are most important to the representation of our financial condition and results of operations and which require management s most difficult and subjective or complex judgments  including accounting estimates that could result in materially different amounts if we reported under different conditions or used different assumptions 
our most critical estimates and judgmen ts include accounting for regulatory cost recovery and amortizations  revenue recognition  derivative instruments and hedging activities  pensions and postretirement benefits  income taxes  and environmental contingencies 
management has discussed its current estimates and judgments used in the application of critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board 
within the context of our critical accounting policies and estimates  management is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances that would result in materially different amounts being reported 
for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that could have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  see note regulatory accounting we are regulated by the opuc and wutc  which establish our utility rates and rules governing utility services provided to customers  and  to a certain extent  set forth the accounting treatment for certain regulatory transactions 
in general  we use the same accounting principles as non regulated companies reporting under gaap 
however  authoritative guidance for regulated operations regulatory accounting require different accounting treatment for regulated companies to show the effects of such regulation 
for example  we account for the cost of gas using a pga deferral and cost recovery mechanism  which is submitted for approval annually to the opuc and wutc see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  below 
there are other expenses or revenues that the opuc or wutc may require us to defer for recovery or refund in future periods 
regulatory accounting requires us to account for these types of deferred expenses or deferred revenues as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities on the balance sheet 
when we are allowed to recover these expenses from  or required to refund them to  customers  we recognize the expense or revenue on the income statement at the same time we realize the adjustment to amounts included in utility rates charged to customers 

table of contents the conditions we must satisfy to adopt the accounting policies and practices of regulatory accounting  which are applicable to regulated companies  include an independent regulator sets rates  the regulator sets the rates to cover specific costs of delivering service  and the service territory lacks competitive pressures to reduce rates below the rates set by the regulator 
because we meet all three conditions  we continue to apply regulatory accounting principles for our utility operations 
future accounting changes  regulatory changes or changes in the competitive environment could require us to discontinue the application of regulatory accounting for some or all of our regulated businesses 
this would require the write off of those regulatory assets and liabilities that would no longer be probable of recovery from or refund to customers 
based on current accounting  regulatory and competitive conditions  we believe that it is reasonable to expect continued application of regulatory accounting for our regulated activities  and that all of our regulatory assets and liabilities at december  and a re recoverable or refundable through future customer rates 
the net balance on regulatory asset and liability accounts as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
see industry regulation in note revenue recognition utility revenues  derived primarily from the sale and transportation of natural gas  are recognized when gas is delivered to and received by the customer 
revenues are accrued for gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed  based on estimates of gas deliveries from the last meter reading date to month end accrued unbilled revenues 
accrued unbilled revenues are primarily based on a percentage estimate of our unbilled gas deliveries each month  which is dependent upon a number of factors  some of which require management s judgment 
these factors include total gas receipts and deliveries  customer meter reading dates  customer usage patterns and weather 
accrued unbilled revenue estimates are reversed the following month when ac tual billings occur 
estimated unbilled revenues at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the decrease in accrued unbilled revenues at year end was primarily due to lower volumes in reflecting warmer weather in late december and lower customer rates 
if the estimated percentage of unbilled volume at december  was adjusted up or down by percent  then our unbilled revenues  net operating revenues and net income would have increased or decreased by an estimated million  million and million  respectively 
utility revenues also include the recognition of a regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid 
this revenue reflects an opuc rule whereby we are required to automatically implement a rate refund or a rate surcharge to utility customers 
this refund or surcharge is accrued based on the estimated difference between income taxes paid and income taxes authorized to be collected in rates for further discussion  see results of operations business segments utility operations regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid  below 
non utility revenues  derived primarily from our gas storage business segment  are recognized upon delivery of service to customers 
revenues from our asset optimization partner are recognized as earned based on multiple revenue elements  which is generally over the period of each optimization deal except for a contract with a guaranteed amount which is amortized over the life of the contract 

table of contents accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities our gas acquisition and hedging policies set forth guidelines for using financial derivative instruments to support prudent risk management strategies 
these policies specifically prohibit the use of derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the accounting rules for determining whether a contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument or qualifies for hedge accounting treatment are complex 
the contracts that meet the definition of a derivative instrument are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value 
if certain regulatory conditions are met  then the derivative instrument fair value is recorded together with an offsetting entry to a regulatory asset or liability account pursuant to regulatory accounting see note  industry regulation  and no unrealized gain or loss is recognized i n current income 
the gain or loss from the fair value of a derivative instrument subject to regulatory deferral is included in the recovery from  or refund to  utility customers in future periods see regulatory accounting  above 
if a derivative contract is not subject to regulatory deferral  then the accounting treatment for unrealized gains and losses is recorded in accordance with accounting standards for derivatives and hedging see note  derivatives and industry regulation which is either in current income or in accumulated other comprehensive income under common stock equity on the balance sheet 
our derivative contracts outstanding at december  were measured at fair value using models or other market accepted valuation methodologies derived from observable market data 
our estimate of fair value may change significantly from period to period depending on market conditions and prices 
these changes may h ave an impact on our results of operations  but the impact would largely be mitigated due to the majority of our derivatives activities being subject to regulatory deferral treatment 
for estimated fair values on unrealized gains and losses at december  and  see note commodity based derivative contracts entered into by the utility after our annual pga filing for the current gas contract period are subject to a regulatory incentive sharing mechanism in oregon see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  below 
the portion not deferred to a regulatory account pursuant to that sharing agreement is recognized either in current income for contracts not qualifying for hedge accounting or in accumulated other comprehensive income for contracts qualifying for hedge accounting 
derivative contracts not qualifying for regulatory deferral are subject to a hedge effectiveness test to determine the financial statement treatment of each specific derivative 
as of december   all of our derivatives were effective economic hedges and either qualified or were expected to qualify for regulatory deferral or hedge accounting treatment 
we use the hypothetical derivative method under accounting standards for derivatives and hedging to determine the hedge effectiveness for our interest rate swaps and the dollar offset method for other derivative contracts under accounting standards for derivatives and hedging 
the effectiveness test applied to financial derivatives is dependent on the type of derivative and its use 
the following table summarizes the amount of realized gains and losses from commodity price  interest rate and currency hedge transactions for the last three years thousands net gain loss on commodity price swaps utility net gain loss on commodity price options utility net gain loss on interest rate swap utility subtotal on commodity utility net gain loss on foreign currency forward purchases utility total realized net gain loss realized gains losses from commodity hedges and foreign currency forward purchase contracts are recorded as reductions increases to the cost of gas and are included in the calculation of annual pga rate changes 
realized gains losses from interest rate hedges are recorded as reductions increases to interest charges over the term of the underlying debt issuances 
unrealized gains and losses from commodity hedges  foreign currency hedges and interest rate hedges  which reflect quarterly mark to market valuations  are generally not recognized in current income or accumulated other comprehensive income  but are recorded as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets  and are offset by a corresponding balance in derivative instruments see note 

table of contents accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits we maintain two qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering a majority of our regular employees with more than one year of service  several non qualified supplemental pension plans for eligible executive officers and certain key employees and other postretirement employee benefit plans 
we also have a qualified defined contribution plan retirement k savings plan for all eligible employees 
only the two qualified defined benefit pension plans and retirement k savings plan have plan assets  which are held in a qualified trust to fund retirement benefits 
effective january  and  the qualified defined benefit retirement plans and postretirement benefits for non union employees and for union employees  respectively  were closed to new participants 
these plans were not available to employees at our nwn gas storage affiliate 
instead  non union and union employees hired or re hired after december  and  respectively  and our nwn gas storage employees  are provided an enhanced retirement k savings plan benefit 
also  effective january  the postretirement welfare benefit plan for non bargaining unit employees was closed to new participants after december  net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs retirement benefit costs and projected benefit obligations benefit obligations are determined in accordance with accounting standards for compensation and retirement benefits using a number of key assumptions including discount rates  rate of compensation increases  retirement ages  mortality rates and an expected long term return on plan assets see note 
these key assumptions have a significant impact on the pension amounts recorded and disclosed 
retirement benefit costs consist of service costs  interest costs  the amortization of actuarial gains  losses and prior service costs  the expected returns on plan assets and  in part  on a market related valuation of assets  if applicable 
the market related asset valuation reflects difference s between expected returns and actual investment returns  which we recognize over a three year period or less from the year in which they occur  thereby reducing year to year volatility in retirement benefit costs 
accounting standards also require balance sheet recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of pension and postretirement benefit plans in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  net of tax  based on the fair value of plan assets compared to the actuarial value of future benefit obligations 
however  the retirement benefit costs relating to our qualified defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are generally recovered in utility rates which are set based on accounting standards for pensions and postretirement benefits  and as such we received approval from the opuc pursuant to regulatory accounting to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability based on expected rate recovery  rather than including it as aoci under common equity see regulat ory accounting  above  and note  industry regulation 
also effective january  the opuc has authorized the use of a pension balancing account to allow differences between the annual pension cost allocated to operation and maintenance expense and the amount recovered annually in rates per the general rate case to be recorded in a regulatory asset account 
the regulatory asset account will earn a carrying cost at the authorized cost of capital rate set by the opuc 
a number of factors are considered in developing pension and postretirement assumptions  including evaluations of relevant discount rates  an evaluation of expected long term investment returns based on asset classes and target asset allocations  expected changes in salaries and wages  analyses of past retirement plan experience and current market conditions and input from actuaries and other consultants 
for the december  measurement date  we reviewed and updated our pension and postretirement weighted average discount rate assumptions from percent to percent and from percent to percent  respectively 
the new rate assumptions were determined for each plan based on a matching of the estimated cash flow  which reflects the timing and amount of future benefit payments  to the citigroup above median curve  which consists of high quality bonds rated aa or higher by standard poor s s p or aa or higher by moody s investors service moody s  our expected annual rate of future compensation increases remained unchanged at a range of to percent  our expected long term return on qualified defined benefit plan assets remained unchanged at percent  and other key assumptions as needed based on actual experience and actuarial recommendations 

table of contents at december   our net pension liability benefit obligations less market value of plan assets for the two qualified defined benefit plans increased million compared to the increase in our net pension liability is primarily due to the million increase in our pension obligation  which was partially offset by our million cash contribution 
the liability for non qualified plans increased million and the liability for other postretirement benefits increased million in we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets by averaging the expected earnings for the target asset portfolio 
in developing our expected return  we evaluate an analysis of historical actual performance and long term return projections  which gives consideration to the current asset mix and our target asset allocation 
as of december   the actual annualized returns on plan assets  net of management fees  for the past one year  five years  years and since december were percent  percent  percent and percent  respectively 
we believe our assumptions to be appropriate based on plan design and an assessment of market conditions 
however  if our pension assumptions changed percent  the retirement benefits costs would change by million and the benefit obligations would change by million 
if our other post retirement obligations assumptions changed by percent  then our health care benefit cost would change by less than million and the benefit obligation would change by million 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with accounting standards that require the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between financial statement carrying amount and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
at december  and  our net long term deferred tax liability totaled million and million  respectively 
after application of the federal statutory tax rate to book income  judgment is required with respect to the timing and deductibility of expense in our tax returns 
for state income tax and local income taxes  j udgment is also required with respect to the apportionment among the various jurisdictions 
a valuation allowance is recorded if we expect that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will not be realized 
at december   we did not have a valuation allowance due to our expectation that all of these assets will be realized 
these accounting standards also require the recognition of deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences where regulators require us to flow through deferred income tax benefits or expenses in the ratemaking process of the regulated utility regulatory tax assets and liabilities 
this is consistent with the ratemaking policies of the opuc and wutc 
regulatory tax assets and liabilities are recorded to the extent we believe they will be recoverable from  or refunded to  customers in future rates 
at december  and  we had regulatory assets representing differences between book and tax basis related to pre property of million and million  respectively  and recorded an offsetting deferred tax liability 
we received authorization from the opuc and wutc in to accelerate the recovery of these pre regulatory assets through future utility rates 
see notes and uncertain tax positions are accounted for in accordance with accounting standards that require management s assessment of the expected treatment of a tax position taken in a filed tax return  or planned to be taken in a future tax return  that has not been reflected in measuring income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
until such positions are sustained by the taxing authorities  we would not recognize the tax benefits resulting from such positions and would report the tax effect as a liability in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   we had no uncertain tax positions 
the internal revenue service irs is currently examining our through consolidated federal income tax returns 
the irs completed its last examination of the through audit cycle in the second quarter of completion of the through federal income tax return examination is expected during the first quarter of currently we do not have any uncertain tax positions that will have a material impact on our results of operations 
the oregon department of revenue odor is also examining our through consolidated income tax returns 
completion of this examination is expected during the first quarter of interest and penalties  if any  related to income tax adjustments for prior years will be recorded within income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income 

table of contents contingencies loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting standards for contingencies 
estimates of loss contingencies  including estimates of legal costs when such costs are probable of being incurred and are reasonably estimable  and related disclosures are updated when new information becomes available 
estimating probable losses requires an analysis of uncertainties that often depend upon judgments about potential actions by third parties 
accruals for loss contingencies are recorded based on an analysis of potential results 
when information is sufficient to estimate only a range of potential liabilities  and no point within the range is more likely than any other  we recognize an accrued liability at the low end of the range and disclose the range see contingent liabilities  below 
it is possible  however  that the range of potential liabilities could be significantly different than amounts currently accrued and disclosed  with the result that our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected by changes in the assumptions or estimates related to these contingencies 
with respect to environmental liabilities and related costs we develop estimates based on a review of information available from numerous sources  including completed studies and site specific negotiations 
using sampling data  feasibility studies  existing technology and enacted laws and regulations  we estimate that the total future expenditures for environmental investigation  monitoring and remediation are million as of december  it is our policy to accrue the full amount of such liability when information is sufficient to reasonably estimate the amount of probable liability 
when information is not available to reasonably estimate the probable liability  or when only the range of probable liabilities can be estimated and no amount within the range is more likely than another  then it is our policy to accrue at the lower end of the range 
accordingly  due to numerous uncertainties surrounding the course of environmental remediation and the preliminary nature of several site investigations  in some cases  we may not be able to reasonably estimate the high end of the range of possible loss 
in those cases we have disclosed the nature of the potential loss and the fact that the high end of the range cannot be reasonably estimated 
we will continue to seek recovery of such costs through insurance and through customer rates  and we believe recovery of these costs is probable 
if it is determined that both the insurance recovery and future rate recovery of such costs are not probable  the costs will be charged to expense in the period such determination is made 
see note results of operations regulatory matters regulation and rates we are subject to regulation with respect to  among other matters  rates and systems of accounts by the opuc  the wutc  ferc  and with respect to gill ranch  the cpuc 
the opuc and wutc and  with respect to gill ranch  the cpuc  also regulate our issuance of securities 
in  approximately percent of our utility gas volumes were delivered to  and utility operating revenues were derived from  oregon customers and the balance from washington customers 
future earnings and cash flows from utility operations will be determined largely by the oregon and washington economies in general  and by the pace of growth in the residential and commercial markets in particular  and by our ability to remain price competitive  control expenses  and obtain reasonable and timely regulatory recovery for our utility gas costs  oper ating and maintenance costs and investments made in utility plant 

table of contents general rate cases oregon 
in our most recent general rate case in oregon  which was effective in september  the opuc authorized rates to customers based on a return on common stock equity roe of percent 
in  in connection with the renewal of our conservation tariff and weather normalization rate mechanism  the opuc approved a stipulation that restricts us from filing a general rate case with the opuc prior to september  subject to certain exceptions 
under the agreement  we would be allowed to file a general rate case if an extraordinary event occurs or significant investments are required on behalf of our customers and we are unable to reach agreement regarding alternative forms of cost recovery outside of a general rate case 
these exceptions might include addit ional investments in our pipeline integrity management program 
this agreement does not impact our ability to file annual rate adjustments to reflect changes in gas purchase costs under our pga mechanism or our ability to collect or refund prior year s gas cost deferrals 
see rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  below 
washington 
in our most recent general rate case in washington  the wutc authorized rates to customers based on a roe of percent  which is included as part of an overall rate of return on total invested capital of percent 
these customer rates went into effect on january   with annual revenue requirements increased by million  or percent 
federal 
we are required under our mist interstate storage certificate authority and rate approval orders to file every five years either a petition for rate approval or a cost and revenue study to change or justify maintaining the existing rates for our interstate storage services 
our most recent filing of a cost and revenue study was in april as a result of that proceeding  the current maximum cost based rates for our interstate gas storage services were approved by ferc  with maximum rates unchanged from prior levels approved by ferc in in addition  we made a filing in december to obtain ferc approval to revise the depreciation rates associated with mist assets used to derive the cost based interstate storage rates 
these new depreciation rates were designed to match the depreciation rates for the same type of assets approved under state regulation 
we did not make any changes to the previously approved maximum rates  and ferc approved the depreciation rate filing in may we are required to make our next cost and revenue study filing at ferc on or before december  california 
gill ranch is authorized by the cpuc to charge market based rates for the intrastate storage services offered to customers in california 
rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment 
rate changes are established for the utility each year under pga mechanisms in oregon and washington to reflect changes in the expected cost of natural gas commodity purchases  including contract gas purchase prices  gas prices hedged with financial derivatives  gas inventory prices  interstate pipeline demand costs  the application of temporary rate adjustments to amortize balances in deferred regulatory accounts and the removal of temporary rate adjustments effective for the previous year 
in october  the opuc and wutc approved pga rate changes effective on november  the effect of these rate changes was to decrease the average monthly bills of oregon and washington residential customers by percent 
this is our second consecutive year of rate decreases 
the opuc and wutc also approved rate decreases effective november  of percent and percent in oregon and washington  respectively 
under the current pga mechanism in oregon  there is an incentive sharing provision whereby we are required to select by august of each year either an percent deferral or a percent deferral of higher or lower actual gas costs compared to estimated pga prices such that the impact on current earnings from the incentive sharing is either percent or percent of the difference between actual and estimated gas costs  respectively 
in addition to the gas cost incentive sharing mechanism  we are subject to an annual earnings review to determine if the utility is earning above its allowed roe threshold 
if utility earnings exceed a specific roe level  then percent of the amount above that level will be deferred for refund to customers 
under this provision  if we select the percent deferral option  then we retain all of our earnings up to basis points above the currently authorized roe 
if we select the percent deferral option  then we retain all of our earnings up to basis points above the currently authorized roe 
we selected the percent deferral option for both the and the pga years 
the roe threshold is subject to adjustment up or down annually based on movements in long term interest rates 
in september  we received the final report from the opuc on our earnings review  which indicated a utility regulated roe of percent 
this is below the allowed roe threshold of percent  and therefore no earnings were deferred for refund to customers 
based upon utility results through december   we expect to refund approximately million to customers 

table of contents there has been no change to the washington pga mechanism under which we defer percent of the higher or lower actual gas costs and pass that difference through to customers as an adjustment to future rates 
we do not have an earnings or gas cost sharing mechanism in washington 
conservation tariff 
in october  the opuc authorized the implementation of a conservation tariff to adjust utility margin for changes in consumption patterns due to residential and commercial customers conservation efforts 
the conservation tariff is a decoupling mechanism that is intended to break the link between utility earnings and the quantity of gas consumed by customers  removing any financial incentive by the utility to discourage customers efforts to conserve energy 
in washington  customer use is not covered by a conservation or decoupling tariff  and as such our utility earnings are affected by increases and decreases in usage based on customers conservation efforts 
washington customers account for about percent of our utility volumes and revenues 
the oregon conservation tariff includes two components an annual price elasticity adjustment  which adjusts rates for increases or decreases from expected customer volumes due to changes in commodity costs or changes in our general rates  and a monthly conservation adjustment  which adjusts margin revenues to account for the difference between actual and expected customer volumes also referred to as the decoupling adjustment 
the margin adjustment resulting from differences between actual and expected volumes under the decoupling component is recorded to a deferral account  which is included in the next year s annual pga filing 
baseline consumption was determined by customer consumption data used in the oregon general rate case and is adjusted annually for customer growth and the ef fect of the price elasticity adjustment discussed above 
see business segments utility operations  below 
in  an independent study to measure the effectiveness of oregon s conservation tariff mechanism recommended continuation of the tariff with minor modifications  which tariff was approved by the opuc and extended through october weather normalization 
in oregon  we have an opuc approved weather normalization mechanism 
this mechanism is designed to help stabilize the collection of fixed costs by adjusting residential and commercial customer billings based on temperature variances from average weather  with rate decreases when the weather is colder than average and rate increases when the weather is warmer than average 
the mechanism is applied to residential and commercial customers bills between december and may of each heating season 
the mechanism adjusts the margin component of customers rates to reflect average weather  which uses the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
daily average temperatures and year average temperatures are b ased on a set point temperature of degrees fahrenheit for residential customers and degrees fahrenheit for commercial customers see business segments utility operations  below 
the weather normalization mechanism for oregon utility operations is approved through october customers in oregon are allowed to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism  and as of december   percent had elected to opt out 
we do not have a weather normalization mechanism approved for our washington customers  which account for about percent of our utility volumes and revenues 
industrial tariffs 
the opuc and wutc have approved tariffs covering utility service to our major industrial customers  including terms which are intended to give us certainty in the level of gas supplies we need to acquire to serve this customer group 
the terms include an annual election period  special pricing provisions for out of cycle changes and a requirement that industrial customers under our annual pga tariff complete the term of their service election 
system integrity program 
in  the opuc approved specific accounting treatment and cost recovery for our transmission pipeline integrity management program  a program mandated by the pipeline safety improvement act of and the related rules adopted by the us department of transportation s pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa 
we record these costs as either capital expenditures or regulatory assets  accumulate the costs over each month period  and recover the revenue requirement associated with the costs  subject to audit  through rate changes effective with the annual pga in oregon 
congress passed the pipeline inspection  protection  enforcement  and safety act in which included a legislative mandate for phmsa to prescribe minimum standards for integrity management programs for natural gas distribution pipelines 
the phmsa issued a proposed rule for distribution integrity management programs in june 
table of contents in february  the opuc approved a stipulated agreement to create a new  consolidated system integrity program sip 
the sip integrates the company s bare steel replacement  transmission pipeline integrity management and distribution pipeline integrity management programs into a single program 
in december  the phmsa issued the final rule for distribution integrity management programs 
our sip costs are tracked into rates annually  with rate recovery after the first million of capital costs 
an annual cap for expenditures has been set at million  but extraordinary costs above the cap may be approved with written consent of the opuc staff and other interested parties and approval of the opuc 
the sip allows recovery of costs incurred in oregon during the period from octob er through october  or until the effective date of new rates adopted in our next general rate case 
the company has initiated discussions with the opuc and other interested parties to extend the term of the sip 
we do not have any special accounting or rate treatment for sip costs incurred in the state of washington 
in congress is expected to pass legislation continuing phmsa s authority to oversee the nation s hazardous liquid and natural gas pipeline infrastructure 
the pipeline safety legislation will likely include mandates for additional pipeline safety requirements  however  it is not possible to determine the materiality of possible new pipeline safety regulations at this time 
regulatory recovery for environmental costs 
the opuc has authorized us to defer environmental costs associated with certain named sites and to accrue interest on environmental cost balances  subject to an annual demonstration that we have maximized our insurance recovery or made substantial progress in securing insurance recovery for unrecovered environmental expenses 
these authorizations have been extended through january we have filed a request for an extension of this deferral and expect to receive this authorization during the first quarter of see note in february  we filed a request with the wutc to defer environmental costs associated with services provided to washington customers 
pension deferral 
in march  we filed a request with the opuc for authorization to defer pension expenses above the amount set in rates  and to recover the amount through a balancing account that would include the effects of anticipated higher and lower pension expenses in future years 
the opuc approved the pension cost balancing account effective january   with accrued interest on the account balance at the utility s authorized rate of return 
the estimated reduction to operation and maintenance expense for is approximately to million 
future year deferrals will depend on changes in plan assets and projected benefit liabilities using a number of key assumptions  as well as our pension contributions 
see applicatio n of critical accounting policies and estimates  above 
customer refunds for gas storage sharing 
in june  million was credited to utility customers from our regulatory incentive sharing mechanism related to gas storage and optimization services of pipeline capacity and gas storage at mist see gas storage  below 
in june  we credited million to customers under the same regulatory mechanism 

table of contents business segments utility operations our utility margin results are affected by customer growth and to a certain extent by changes in weather and customer consumption patterns  with a significant portion of our earnings being derived from natural gas sales to residential and commercial customers 
in oregon  we have a conservation tariff that adjusts revenues to offset changes in margin resulting from increases or decreases in residential and commercial customer consumption 
we also have a weather normalization mechanism in oregon that adjusts customer bills up or down to offset changes in margin resulting from above or below average temperatures during the winter heating season see results of operations regulatory matters rate mechanisms  above 
both mechanisms are designed to reduce the volatility of our utility earnings 
compared to our utility segment in earned million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in the major factors contributing to the change were reduced operating expenses largely offset by lower utility margins  which consisted of a million decrease from the prior year s gas cost incentive sharing  partially offset by a net million increase in margin from residential and commercial customers  including the effects of the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms and a million increase in industrial margin 
total utility volumes sold and delivered in decreased by percent over last year due to the effects of warmer weather on residential and commercial use and the lingering effects of a weak economy on commercial use 
the regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid also increased margin by million compared to our weather normalization mechanism adjusted residential and commercial margins up by million for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent warmer than average  compared to a margin reduction of million for the year ended december  when weather was percent colder than average 
our decoupling mechanism adjusted residential and commercial margins up by million in  after adjusting for expected price elasticity impacts from lower pga prices effective november   compared to margin adjustments totaling million in compared to our utility segment in earned million  or per share  compared to million  or per share in the major factor contributing to the increase in utility margin was a million increase in our gas cost incentive sharing from lower gas prices 
total utility volumes sold and delivered in decreased by percent compared to due to the effects of warmer weather on residential and commercial use and the effects of a weak economy on commercial and industrial use 
margin was reduced by million in compared to due to a customer rate decrease which corresponded to a decrease in depreciation rates and expense effective january  excluding the impact of lower depreciation rates on revenues  our margin from residential and commercial customers increased by million in  including the effects of the weather normalization and decoupling mechanisms 
industrial margin declined million  but would have decreased by million if the depreciation rate impact was excluded 
the regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid also increased margin by million in compared to  primarily due to the cost of gas savings in our weather normalization mechanism adjusted residential and commercial margins down by million for the year ended december  based on weather that was percent colder than average  compared to a reduction of million for the year ended december  when weather was percent colder than average 
our decoupling mechanism increased residential and commercial margin by million in  after adjusting for expected price elasticity impacts from higher pga prices effective november   compared to a margin increase of million in

table of contents in june  we refunded gas cost savings totaling million to our oregon and washington customers 
the following non gaap table summarizes the impact of this refund on our operating revenues  cost of gas sold and margin for the year ended december   along with a comparison to the years ended december  and we believe this non gaap financial calculation enables the reader of the financial statements to better understand our operating revenues  cost of gas sold and utility margin performance from management s perspective in addition to the traditional gaap presentation

typically  percent or more of our annual utility operating revenues are derived from gas sales to weather sensitive residential and commercial customers 
although variations in temperatures between periods will affect volumes of gas sold to these customers  the effect on margin and net income is significantly reduced due to our weather normalization mechanism in oregon where about percent of our customers are served 
for more information on our weather mechanism  see regulatory matters rate mechanisms weather normalization  above 
the primary changes that impacted margin from residential and commercial sales were as follows compared to gas sales volumes were percent lower  primarily reflecting percent warmer weather  conservation efforts and weak economic conditions  utility operating revenues decreased million or percent primarily due to the percent volume decline and customer rate decreases of and percent in oregon and washington  respectively  effective november   and utility margin increased million or percent primarily due to customer growth of percent and colder weather in the spring of that was not offset by the oregon weather normalization mechanism 

table of contents compared to volumes were percent lower  primarily reflecting percent warmer weather  conservation efforts and weak economic conditions  utility operating revenues decreased million or percent primarily due to million in customer refunds for gas cost savings  partially offset by customer rate increases of and percent in oregon and washington  respectively  effective november   and customer growth of percent  and utility margin decreased million or percent primarily due to lower volumes and customer rate decreases related to new depreciation rates 
industrial sales and transportation industrial sales and transportation revenues include the commodity cost component of gas sold under sales service but not under transportation service 
therefore  industrial customers switching between sales service and transportation service can cause swings in operating revenues but generally our margins are unaffected because our rates do not mark up the cost of gas 
as such  we believe margin is a better measure of performance for the industrial sector 
the primary changes that impacted margin from industrial sales and transportation were as follows compared to volumes delivered to industrial customers increased million therms  and margin increased million  or percent 
compared to volumes delivered to industrial customers decreased million therms  or percent  reflecting reduced usage due to weak economic conditions  and margin decreased million  or percent  reflecting lower volumes and customer rate decreases related to new depreciation rates  but that was partially offset by fixed charges not affected by declining use 
several industrial customers transferred from sales service to transportation service in and changes in natural gas prices can result in industrial customers switching between sales and transportation service 
in such cases  our tariff allows us to charge the incremental cost of gas supply incurred  if any  to serve those customers so that the cost does not adversely impact our margins or the prices our residential and commercial customers pay 
regulatory adjustment for income taxes paid oregon law requires regulated natural gas and electric utilities to annually review the amount of income taxes collected in rates from utility operation and compare it to the amount the utility actually pays to taxing authorities 
under this law  if we pay less in income taxes related to utility operations than we collect from oregon utility customers  or if our utility taxes paid are less than the taxes we collect from oregon utility customers  then we are required to refund the excess to our oregon utility customers 
conversely  if we pay more income taxes than we actually collect from oregon utility customers  then we are required to collect a surcharge from oregon utility customers 
for the and tax years  the opuc approved our tax filings to recover million and million  respectively  through a surcharge to oregon utility customers 
it was agreed that the surcharge  plus accrued interest  would be collected over a one year period beginning june  it was also agreed that the surcharge  plus accrued interest  would be collected over a one year period beginning june  for the tax year  we estimated the difference between income taxes paid and the amounts collected in rates will result in a surcharge of million excluding interest 
the surcharge was primarily driven by gains from gas cost savings related to our pga incentive sharing mechanism 
the surcharge was primarily driven by gas cost savings relat ed to our pga incentive sharing as well as lower utility operating expenses and higher residential  commercial and industrial margins 

table of contents other revenues other revenues include miscellaneous fee income as well as revenue adjustments reflecting deferrals to  or amortizations from  regulatory asset or liability accounts  except for gas cost deferrals which flow through cost of gas sold 
other revenues increased net operating revenues by million in  compared to million in and million in compared to other revenues decreased to in primarily reflecting an increase in decoupling amortization totaling million  partially offset by a million increase in the refund to utility customers related to the gas storage regulatory sharing mechanism 
compared to other revenues in were million lower than in primarily reflecting a million decrease in the regulatory surcharge for income taxes paid and a million decrease in curtailment charges  partially offset by a million refund to utility customers related to the gas storage regulatory sharing mechanism 
cost of gas sold the cost of gas sold includes gas purchases  gas drawn from storage inventory  gains and losses from commodity hedges  pipeline demand costs  seasonal demand cost balancing adjustments  regulatory gas cost deferrals and company gas use 
our regulated utility does not generally earn a profit or incur a loss on gas commodity purchases 
the opuc and the wutc require the natural gas commodity cost to be billed to customers at the same cost incurred or expected to be incurred by the utility 
however  under the pga mechanism in oregon  our net income is affected by differences between actual and expected purchased gas costs  which occur primarily because of market fluctuations and volatility affecting unhedged gas purchases see regulatory matters rate mechanisms purchased gas adjustment  r  above 
we use natural gas derivatives  primarily fixed price commodity swaps  consistent with our financial derivatives policies to help manage our exposure to rising gas prices 
gains and losses from financial hedge contracts are generally included in our pga prices and normally do not impact net income as the hedges are usually percent passed through to customers in annual rate changes  subject to a regulatory prudency review 
however  utility gas hedges entered into after the annual pga filing in oregon may impact net income to the extent of our share of any gain or loss under the pga

gas storage our gas storage segment currently consists of the non utility portion of our mist underground storage facility  non utility asset optimization and start up costs at gill ranch 
for the year ended december   we earned million  or cents per share  from our gas storage segment compared to million  or cents per share  for the same period in this decrease is primarily due to start up costs at gill ranch 
we provide gas storage services to customers in the interstate and intrastate markets from our mist gas storage field in oregon  primarily using storage capacity that has been developed in advance of core utility customers requirements 
under a regulatory incentive sharing mechanism in oregon  we retain percent of pre tax income from our mist gas storage services and from optimization services when the costs of the capacity being used are not included in utility rates  and percent of pre tax income from such storage and optimization services when the capacity being used is pipeline or is included in utility rates 
the remaining percent and percent  respectively  are credited to a deferred regulatory account for credit to our core utility customers 
we have a similar sharing mechanism in washington for pre tax income derived from gas storage and optimization services 
we have a joint agreement with pg e to develop  own and operate an underground natural gas storage facility near fresno  california 
our percent undivided ownership interest in the project is held by our wholly owned subsidiary  gill ranch  which is also the sole operator of the project

table of contents consolidated operations operations and maintenance operations and maintenance expense was million in  compared to million in  a decrease of million or percent 
the following summarizes the major factors that contributed to changes in operations and maintenance expense compared to a million decrease in utility payroll expense related to a reduced number of employees 
there was a reduction of employees or percent over the two year period beginning january  a million decrease in utility bad debt expense see below for further discussion  a million decrease in pension expense  due to the increase in market value of plan investments from contributions in and  a million decrease in health care and other employee benefit expense due to reduced employee count  a million decrease in damage claims in partially offsetting the above factors were a million increase in gas storage expenses  primarily related to start up costs including salaries and benefits  power costs  legal fees and investment bank consulting costs  and a million increase for consulting and legal fees at the utility related to a successful property tax appeal 
compared to an million increase in pension expense primarily due to lower assumed discount rates and a decrease in our plans funded status  which resulted from a significant decline in the market value of assets during  a million increase in employee labor and benefit expense due to higher health care premiums and higher bonuses related to above target operating results  which affect annual incentive payments and compensation  a million charge related to our voluntary severance program involving workforce reductions during the third and fourth quarters of a million increase in strategic initiatives including performance improvement and corporate tax projects  and a million increase in utility bad debt expense see discussion below 
partially offsetting the above increases were a million decrease in employee compensation expense related to reduced employee count  and a million decrease in claims in our bad debt expense as a percent of revenues was percent for the year ended december   compared to percent for the same period last year 
the lower bad debt expense ratio was partly due to improved collections and increased recoveries from delinquent account balances 
credit risks are still somewhat high due to the weak economy and high unemployment rates  but our credit exposure has improved as evidenced by a decrease in delinquent account balances over last year 
lower customer usage from warmer than normal weather this past winter coupled with customer conservation  lower gas prices and low income energy assistance funds have contributed to our reduced credit exposure 
health care costs have been trending higher  and it was recently reported that local and national health care cost increases were expected to be between and percent in based on recent premium notices  we estimate that our employee health and welfare benefit costs for will increase by approximately percent  including potential changes imposed by health care reform 

table of contents in addition  our pension costs are expected to increase in however  effective january  the opuc approved the deferral of utility pension expense above the amount recovered in rates  which was set in our last general rate case 
the pension expense deferral will be recorded to a regulatory balancing account  and we expect it will result in a to million decrease in operations and maintenance expense for for further explanation of the pension balancing account  see regulatory matters rate mechanisms pension deferral  above

compared to a million or percent increase in property taxes related to a percent increase in net utility plant balances  and a million increase in payroll taxes due to higher incentive compensation and employee severance compensation in over the past several years  we had been involved in litigation with the oregon department of revenue over whether inventories held for sale were required to be taxed as personal property 
in january  the oregon supreme court unanimously ruled in our favor  stating that these inventories were exempt from property tax 
as a result of this ruling  we were entitled to a refund of approximately million  plus accrued interest  for property taxes paid on inventories beginning with the tax year 
we recognized a net million increase in pre tax income in the first quarter of  which consisted of million for the refund of property taxes  million for accrued interest income  and million of increased operations and maintenance expense for legal and consulting services 
we received all of the property tax refunds 
depreciation and amortization total depreciation and amortization expense in increased by million  or percent  as compared to a million or percent decrease in over the increased expense in was primarily related to gill ranch going into service in the fourth quarter of plus the additional investments in utility plant for customer growth and system improvements

these subsidy payments become taxable in years beginning after december  accounting guidance on income taxes requires the impact of this tax law change to be immediately recognized in the period that includes the enactment date 
this provision of the ppaca did not have  and is not expected to have  an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows as we were not receiving federal subsidy payments under medicare part d 
financial condition capital structure one of our long term goals is to maintain a strong consolidated capital structure  generally consisting of to percent common stock equity and to percent long term and short term debt 
when additional capital is required  debt or equity securities are issued depending upon both the target capital structure and market conditions 
these sources also are used to fund long term debt redemption requirements and short term commercial paper maturities see liquidity and capital resources  below  and notes and 
achieving the target capital structure and maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet operating requirements are necessary to maintain attractive credit ratings and have access to capital markets at reasonable costs 
our consolidated capital structure was as follows for the year s ended december  and december  common stock equity long term debt short term debt  including current maturities of long term debt total liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december  we also had million in restricted cash invested at gill ranch as of december   compared to million as of december   which was being held as collateral for equipment purchase contracts and construction loans 
in order to maintain sufficient liquidity during periods of volatile capital markets  at times we will maintain higher cash balances  add short term borrowing capacity  and pre fund utility capital expenditures while long term fixed rate environments are attractive 
our short term liquidity is supported by cash balances  internal cash flow from operations  proceeds from the sale of commercial paper notes  committed multi year credit facilities  cash available from surre nder value in company owned life insurance policies  and proceeds from the sale of long term debt 
we use long term debt proceeds to finance utility capital expenditures  refinance maturing short term and long term debt and provide for general corporate purposes 
in march  we issued million of secured mtns with an interest rate of percent and a maturity date of february  in july  we issued million of secured mtns with an interest rate of percent and a maturity date of july 
table of contents the capital markets in the last two years  including the commercial paper market  experienced significant volatility and tight credit conditions  but conditions over the past months improved as reflected by tighter credit spreads and increased access to new financing for investment grade issuers 
with our current debt ratings see credit ratings  below  we have been able to issue commercial paper and mtns at attractive rates and have not needed to borrow from our back up credit facilities 
in the event that we are not able to issue new debt due to market conditions  we expect that our near term liquidity needs can be met by using cash balances or drawing upon our committed credit facilities 
we also have a universal shelf registration filed with the securities and exchange commission for the issuance of secured and unse cured debt or equity securities  subject to market conditions and regulatory approvals 
we have opuc approval to issue up to million of additional mtns under the existing shelf registration  which was filed in january in the event that our senior unsecured long term debt credit ratings are downgraded  or our outstanding derivative position exceeds a certain credit threshold  our counterparties under derivative contracts could require us to post cash  a letter of credit or other form of collateral  which could expose us to additional cash requirements and may trigger significant increases in short term borrowings 
if the credit risk related contingent features underlying these contracts were triggered on december   we could have been required to post million of collateral to our counterparties  but that assumes our long term debt ratings were at non investment grade levels see note and credit ratings  below 
recent developments that may have an impact on our liquidity and capital resources include pension contributions  tax benefits and environmental expenditures and insurance recoveries 
with respect to pension requirements  we expect to make additional contributions in and in future years until we are fully funded under the pension protection act rules see pension cost and funding status of qualified retirement plans  below 
with respect to federal income tax liabilities  an extension was granted that allows us to take percent bonus depreciation on a majority of our capital expenditures in  and percent bonus depreciation on qualified expenditures during  which will significantly reduce our tax liability for the and tax years thereby providing cash flow benefits in late and see cash flows operating activities  below 
and with respect to environmental liabilities  we expect to continue using cash resources to fund our environmental liabilities  but we also anticipate recovering amounts through insurance or utility rates over the next several years  although the amount and timing of these expenditures and recoveries is uncertain see note 
in addition  gill ranch began commercial operations in october although we anticipate future operating cash flows  the amount and timing of these cash flows are uncertain 
in july  the us congress passed and president obama signed into law the wall street reform and consumer protection act 
the new legislation will require additional government regulation of derivative and over the counter transactions  and could expand collateral requirements 
while we are currently evaluating the new legislation to determine its impact  if any  on our hedging procedures  results of operations  financial position and liquidity  we do not expect to know the full impact of the legislation until final regulations implementing the legislation are issued 
based on several factors  including our current credit ratings  recent experience issuing commercial paper  current cash reserves  committed credit facilities and other liquidity resources  and our expected ability to issue long term debt in the form of an mtn program under our universal shelf registration  we believe our liquidity is sufficient to meet anticipated near term cash requirements  including all contractual obligations and investing and financing activities discussed below 

table of contents dividend policy we have paid quarterly dividends on our common stock each year since the stock was first issued to the public in annual common stock dividend payments per share  adjusted for stock splits  have increased each year since the amount and timing of dividends payable on our common stock is within the sole discretion of our board of directors 
subject to board approval  we expect to continue paying quarterly cash dividends on common stock 
however  the declarations and amount of future dividends will depend upon our earnings  cash flows  financial condition and other factors including board approval 
off balance sheet arrangements except for certain lease and purchase commitments see contractual obligations  below  we have no material off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table shows our contractual obligations at december  by maturity and type of obligation 
payments due in years ending december  thousands thereafter total commercial paper long term debt maturities interest on long term debt postretirement benefit payments capital leases operating leases gas purchase contracts gas pipeline commitments other purchase commitments total the majority of postretirement benefit payments are related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans  which are funded by plan assets and future cash contributions 
see note all gas purchase contracts use price formulas tied to monthly index prices 
commitment amounts are based on index prices at december  excludes a noncash gill ranch agreement for million of cushion gas 
other purchase commitments primarily consist of remaining balances under existing purchase orders 
these and other contractual obligations are financed through cash from operations and from the issuance of short term debt  which is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
at december   of our utility employees were members of the office and professional employees international union  local no 
in july  our union employees ratified a new five year labor agreement called the joint accord 
the agreement included a scheduled percent wage increase each year  with the potential for up to an additional percent per year based on wage inflation and other factors 
the joint accord also maintains competitive health benefits while limiting the cost increases for these benefits to the same level as the annual wage increases  and provides increased job flexibility along with the ability for the company to use short term unpaid leave to temporarily adjust the workforce without layoffs 
the joint accord continues our defined benefit retirement plan and post retire e medical for existing union employees as of december   but closes the plan to new employees hired after december  the term of the new joint accord extends to may   and thereafter from year to year unless either party serves notice of its intent to negotiate modifications to the collective bargaining agreement 

table of contents short term debt our primary source of utility short term liquidity is from internal cash flows and the sale of commercial paper 
in addition to issuing commercial paper to meet working capital requirements  including seasonal requirements to finance gas inventories and accounts receivable  short term debt may also be used to temporarily fund utility capital requirements 
commercial paper is periodically refinanced through the sale of long term debt or equity securities 
our outstanding commercial paper  which is sold through two commercial banks under an issuing and paying agency agreement  is supported by one or more unsecured revolving credit facilities see credit agreements  below 
our commercial paper program did not experience any liquidity disruptions as a result of the credit problems th at affected issuers of asset backed commercial paper and certain other commercial paper programs over the last several years 
at december  and  our utility had commercial paper outstanding of million and million  respectively 
the effective interest rate on the utility s commercial paper outstanding at december  and was percent and percent  respectively 
in march  gill ranch entered into a cash collateralized credit facility for up to million  which was extended through september  in june  gill ranch repaid its million bank loan outstanding using the proceeds from its cash collateralized account 
the effective interest rate on the gill ranch credit facility was percent during credit agreements we have a syndicated multi year credit agreement for unsecured revolving loans totaling million  which may be extended for additional one year periods subject to lender approval 
all lenders agreed to extend the original term for an additional one year period through may  we also have three bilateral credit agreements totaling million in effect from november  through march  all lenders under our syndicated and bilateral credit agreements are major financial institutions with committed balances and investment grade credit ratings as of december  as follows loan commitment amounts in thousands syndicated bilateral lender rating  by category facility facility aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa total based on credit market conditions  it is possible that one or more lending commitments could be unavailable to us if the lender defaulted due to lack of funds or insolvency 
however  based on our current assessment of our lenders creditworthiness  including a review of capital ratios  credit default swap spreads and credit ratings  we believe the risk of lender default is minimal 
as discussed above  we extended commitments with all seven lenders under the syndicated agreement  with commitments totaling million  to may  the syndicated agreement also allows us to request increases in the total commitment amount from time to time  up to a maximum amount of million  and to replace any lenders who decline to extend the maturity date of the credit agreement 
the syndicated agreement also permits the issuance of letters of credit in an aggregate amount up to the applicable total borrowing commitment 
any principal and unpaid interest owed on borrowings under the syndicated and bilateral agreements are due and payable on or before the maturity date 
there were no outstanding balances under these credit agreements at december  and these agreements also require us to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratio of percent or less 
failure to comply with this covenant would entitle the lenders to terminate their lending commitments and accelerate the maturity of all amounts outstanding 
we were in compliance with this covenant at december  and  with consolidated indebtedness to total capitalization ratios of percent and percent  respectively 

table of contents the syndicated and bilateral agreements also require that we maintain credit ratings with standard poor s s p and moody s investors service moody s and notify the lenders of any change in our senior unsecured debt ratings by such rating agencies 
a change in our debt ratings by s p or by moody s is not an event of default  nor is the maintenance of a specific minimum level of debt rating a condition of drawing upon the credit agreement 
however  a change in our debt rating below bbb or baa would require additional approval from the opuc prior to issuance of debt  and interest rates on any loans outstanding under the credit agreements are tied to debt ratings  which would increase or decrease the cost of any loans under the credit agreements when ratings are changed see credit ratings  below 
all three lenders under the short term credit agreements are existing lenders under our syndicated credit agreement 
the short term credit agreements require us to comply with the terms and conditions of the syndicated credit agreement and give the lenders under the short term credit agreements the same rights with respect to the short term credit agreements that they have under the syndicated credit agreement 
credit ratings our debt credit ratings are a factor in our liquidity  affecting our access to the capital markets  including the commercial paper market 
our debt credit ratings also have an impact on the cost of funds and the need to post collateral under derivative contracts 
a change in our ratings below bbb by s p or baa by moody s would require additional approval from the opuc prior to our issuing additional long term debt 
the following table summarizes our current debt ratings from s p and moody s s p moody s commercial paper short term debt a p senior secured long term debt a a senior unsecured long term debt n a a corporate credit rating a n a ratings outlook stable stable the above credit ratings are dependent upon a number of factors  both qualitative and quantitative  and are subject to change at any time

the act extends for one additional year the temporary bonus depreciation rules first enacted in the economic stimulus act of and subsequently renewed in the american recovery and reinvestment act of under the bonus depreciation provision  an additional first year tax deduction is allowed for depreciation equal to percent of the adjusted basis of qualified property through september   and percent through december   in the year the property is placed in service  and the remaining percentage recovered under the normal depreciation rules 
the percent depreciation deduction in the first year is an acceleration of d epreciation deductions that otherwise would have been taken in the later years of an asset s recovery period 
as a result of this extension  we will recognize an increase in our cash flow by reducing our current tax liabilities for the and tax years 
any deductions in excess of income for federal income tax purposes will be carried back to the tax year 
as of december   we have a federal and state income tax receivable balance of million  which we expect to realize in cash flows during

additional savings for oregon and washington customers accumulated  and these amounts were refunded to customers through lower rates starting november  and november  in december  we filed an application with the irs that requested a change in our tax accounting method to expense routine repair and maintenance costs for gas pipelines that are currently being capitalized and depreciated for book purposes 
the irs consented to our request in august  and we recognized a tax deduction of approximately million on our tax return  which resulted in a federal tax refund of approximately million during the fourth quarter of at december   we reported an estimated net operating loss nol for federal and oregon income tax purposes of million and million  respectively  primarily due to the effects of accelerated tax depreciation provided by the economic stimulus act 
as a result of the change in our tax accounting method for repair and maintenance costs discussed above as well as our increased pension contribution  our nol for federal and oregon income tax purposes was million and million on our federal and oregon tax returns  respectively 
the federal nol was carried back to for a refund of taxes paid in prior years  while the oregon nol has been carried forward to reduce current and future taxable income 
we anticipate that we will be able to use all loss carryforwards in future years 
the oregon nol was fully utilized in we have lease and purchase commitments relating to our operating activities that are financed with cash flows from operations

pension cost and funding status of qualified retirement plans pension costs are determined in accordance with accounting standards for compensation and retirement benefits see application of critical accounting policies and estimates accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits  above 
pension costs for our two qualified defined benefit plans  which are allocated between operation expenses and capital expenditures based on employee payroll distributions  totaled million in  a decrease of million from the fair market value of pension assets in these two plans increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due to a positive return on plan assets of million and a million employer contribution  partially offset by benefit payments of million

table of contents new accounting pronouncements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements that may have an impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  see note item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various forms of market risk including commodity supply risk  commodity price risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency risk  credit risk and weather risk 
the following describes our exposure to these risks 
commodity supply risk we enter into spot  short term and long term natural gas supply contracts  along with associated pipeline transportation contracts  to manage our commodity supply risk 
historically  we have arranged for physical delivery of an adequate supply of gas  including gas in our mist storage facility  to meet the expected requirements of our core utility customers 
our gas purchase contracts are primarily index based and subject to monthly re pricing  a strategy that is intended to reflect market price trends during the upcoming year 
commodity price and storage value risk natural gas commodity prices and storage values are subject to market fluctuations due to unpredictable factors including weather  pipeline transportation congestion  drilling technologies  potential market speculation and other factors that affect short term supply and demand 
in addition to managing storage positions through a combination of short and long term fixed price contracts  commodity price financial swap and option contracts financial hedge contracts are used to convert certain natural gas supply contracts from floating prices to fixed or capped prices for utility gas purchases 
these financial hedge contracts are generally included in our annual pga filing for recovery  subject to a regulatory prudence review 
we regularly monitor and manage the financial exposure and liquidity risk of our storage position s and financial hedge contracts 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily associated with new debt financing needed to fund capital requirements  including future contractual obligations and maturities of long term and short term debt 
interest rate risk is primarily managed through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities 
we may also enter into financial derivative instruments  including interest rate swaps  options and other hedging instruments  to manage and mitigate interest rate exposure 
foreign currency risk the costs of certain natural gas commodity supplies and certain pipeline services purchased from canadian suppliers are subject to changes in the value of the canadian currency in relation to the us currency 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge against fluctuations in exchange rates with respect to purchases of natural gas from canadian suppliers 
at december  and  notional amounts under foreign currency forward contracts totaled million and million  respectively 
as of december   all foreign currency forward contracts mature within one year 
if all of the foreign currency forward contracts had been settled on december   a gain of million would have been realized see note 

table of contents credit risk credit exposure to suppliers 
certain suppliers that sell us gas have either relatively low credit ratings or are not rated by major credit rating agencies 
to manage this supply risk  we purchase gas from a number of different suppliers at liquid exchange points 
we evaluate and monitor suppliers creditworthiness and maintain the ability to require additional financial assurances  including deposits  letters of credit or surety bonds  in case a supplier defaults 
in the event of a supplier s failure to deliver contracted volumes of gas  the regulated utility would need to replace those volumes at prevailing market prices  which may be higher o r lower than the original transaction prices 
we believe these costs would be subject to the pga sharing mechanism discussed above 
since most of our commodity supply contracts are priced at the monthly market index price tied to liquid exchange points  and we have significant storage flexibility  we believe that it is unlikely that a supplier default would have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
credit exposure to financial derivative counterparties 
based on estimated fair value at december   our overall credit exposure relating to commodity hedge contracts is considered to be immaterial as it reflects amounts we owed to our financial derivative counterparties totaling million 
however  changes in natural gas prices could result in counterparties owing us money 
therefore our financial derivatives policy requires counterparties to have at least an investment grade credit rating at the time the derivative instrument is entered into  and specific limits on the contract amount and duration based on each counterparty s credit rating 
due to potential changes in market conditions and credit concerns  we continue to enforce st rong credit requirements 
we actively monitor and manage our derivative credit exposure and place counterparties on hold for trading purposes or require cash collateral  letters of credit or guarantees as circumstances warrant 
as of december   we do not have any actual derivative credit risk exposure  which reflects amounts that financial derivative counterparties owe to us 
the following table summarizes our overall credit exposure  based on estimated fair value  and the corresponding counterparty credit ratings 
the table uses credit ratings from s p and moody s  reflecting the higher of the s p or moody s rating or a middle rating if the entity is split rated with more than one rating level difference financial derivative position by credit rating unrealized fair value gain loss thousands aaa aaa aa aa a a bbb baa total in most cases  we also mitigate the credit risk of financial derivatives by having master netting arrangements with our counterparties which provide for making or receiving net cash settlements 
generally  transactions of the same type in the same currency that have a settlement on the same day with a single counterparty are netted and a single payment is delivered or received depending on which party is due funds 
additionally we have master contracts in place with each of our derivative counterparties that include provisions for posting or calling for collateral 
generally we can obtain cash or marketable securities as collateral with one day s notice 
we use various collateral management strategies to reduce liquidity risk 
the collateral provisions vary by counterparty but are not expected to result in the significant posting of collateral  if any 
we have performed stress tests on the portfolio and concluded that the liquidity risk from collateral calls is not material 
our derivative credit exposure is primarily with investment grade counterparties rated aa aa or higher 
contracts are diversified across counterparties to reduce credit and liquidity risk 

table of contents credit exposure to insurance companies for environmental damage claims 
we regularly monitor the financial condition of insurance companies who provide general liability insurance policy coverage to nw natural and its predecessors with respect to environmental damage claims 
we have filed claims for our environmental costs with a number of insurance companies 
the majority of these companies have credit ratings of a or better from am best co 
am best 
am best is a global independent credit rating agency who has provided quantitative and qualitative analysis of insurance company balance sheet strength for over years 
am best uses a rating scale that ranges from a superior financial strength to f in liquidation  with a rating of a considered excellent 
a strong credit rating from am best is not a guarantee that an insurance company will be able to meet its contractual obligations 
the remaining insurance companies who do not have credit ratings of a or better are expected to have sufficient funds in reserves to cover these claims 
our credit exposure to insurance companies for environmental claims  which reflects amounts we believe are owed to us  could be material 
in the event we are unable to recover environmental expenses from these insurance policies  we will seek recovery of unreimbursed amounts through customer rates 
weather risk we are exposed to weather risk primarily from our regulated utility business 
a large percentage of our utility margin is volume driven  and current rates are based on an assumption of average weather 
in  the opuc approved a weather normalization mechanism for residential and commercial customers 
this mechanism affects customer bills between december through may of each winter heating season  increasing or decreasing the margin component of customers rates to reflect gas usage based on average weather using the year average temperature for each day of the billing period 
the mechanism is intended to stabilize the recovery of our utility s fixed costs and reduce fluctuations in customers bills due to colder or warmer than average weather 
customers in oregon are allowe d to opt out of the weather normalization mechanism 
as of december   approximately percent of our oregon customers had opted out 
in addition to the oregon customers opting out  our washington residential and commercial customers account for approximately percent of our total customer base and are not covered by weather normalization 
the combination of oregon and washington customers not covered by a weather normalization mechanism is less than percent of all residential and commercial customers
