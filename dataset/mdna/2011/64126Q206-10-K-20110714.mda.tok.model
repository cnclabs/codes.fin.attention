item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis md a should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained in item herein 
management is of the opinion that inflation and changing prices  including foreign exchange fluctuations  will have little  if any  effect on our consolidated financial position or results of our operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our critical accounting policies and estimates involve the use of complicated processes  assumptions  estimates and or judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting estimate is an approximation made by management of a financial statement element  item or account in the consolidated financial statements 
accounting estimates in our historical consolidated financial statements measure the effects of past business transactions or events  or the present status of an asset or liability 
the accounting estimates described below require us to make assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made 
additionally  different estimates that we could have used or changes in an accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could have a material impact on the presentation of our consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of the board of directors and have identified the following critical accounting policies for the current fiscal year 
principles of consolidation we consolidate entities when we have the ability to control the operating and financial decisions and policies of that entity and record the portion we do not own as noncontrolling interest 
the determination of our ability to control or exert significant influence over an entity involves the use of judgment 
we apply the equity method of accounting where we can exert significant influence over  but do not control the policies and decisions of an entity 
we use the cost method of accounting where we are unable to exert significant influence over the entity 
capitalized development costs we capitalize certain third party legal  professional  and other miscellaneous fees directly related to the procurement  evaluation and establishment of contracts for development projects 
development costs are recorded on the cost basis and are amortized over the estimated economic term of the contract 
we review each project on a quarterly basis to assess whether any changes to our estimates are appropriate 
if accumulated costs of a specific project exceed the net realizable value of such project or the project is abandoned  the costs are charged to earnings 
goodwill  other intangible  and other long lived assets in connection with our acquisition of the colorado grande casino on april   the acquisition of the washington casinos on may   and the acquisition of six additional casinos in washington on july   we have goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of million  net of amortization 
goodwill represents a significant portion of our total assets 
we review goodwill for impairment annually and or more frequently if certain impairment indicators arise under the provisions of authoritative guidance 
we review goodwill at the reporting level unit  which is one level below an operating segment 
we compare the carrying value of the net assets of each reporting unit to the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  based upon a multiple of estimated earnings 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit  an impairment indicator exists and an estimate of the impairment loss is calculated 
the fair value calculation includes multiple assumptions and estimates  including the projected cash flows and discount rates applied 
changes in these assumptions and estimates could result in goodwill impairment that could materially adversely impact our financial position or results of operations 
all of our goodwill is attributable to reporting units within our gaming segment 
we use earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash goodwill and other long lived asset impairment charges  litigation charges  non cash foreign currency transaction gains and losses and net losses gains from asset dispositions ebitda as the measure for future earnings in our impairment test 
management estimates future adjusted ebitda based primarily on its projections of future revenues 
we utilized comparable industry average multiples of adjusted ebitda rates based on industry standards ranging from to times adjusted ebitda when we estimated fair values of our casinos as of april  long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets  also comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets when impairment indicators are present or when circumstances indicate that impairment may exist under authoritative guidance 
when management believes impairment indicators may exist  projections of the undiscounted future cash flows associated with the use of and eventual disposition of long lived assets held for use are prepared 
if the projections indicate that the carrying values of the long lived assets are not recoverable  we reduce the carrying values to fair value 
for property held for sale  we compare the carrying values to an estimate of fair value less selling costs to determine potential impairment 
we test for impairment of long lived assets at the lowest level for which cash flows are measurable 
these impairment tests are heavily influenced by assumptions and estimates that are subject to change as additional information becomes available 
allowance for doubtful accounts we establish provisions for losses on accounts and notes receivable if we determine that we will not collect all or part of the outstanding balance 
we regularly review collectibility and establish or adjust our allowance as necessary using the specific identification method 
we make advances to third parties under executed promissory notes for project costs related to the development of gaming and entertainment properties 
due diligence is conducted by our management with the assistance of legal counsel prior to entering into arrangements with third parties to provide financing in connection with their efforts to secure and develop the properties 
repayment terms are largely dependent upon the operating performance of each opportunity for which the funds have been loaned 
interest income is not accrued until it is reasonably assured that the project will be completed and that there will be sufficient profits from the facility to cover the interest to be earned under the respective note 
if projected cash flows are not sufficient to recover amounts due  the note is evaluated to determine the appropriate discount to be recorded on the note for it to be considered a performing note 
if the note is performing  interest is recorded using the effective interest method based on the value of the discounted note balance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we review on a quarterly basis each of our notes receivable to evaluate whether the collection of such note receivable is still probable 
in our analysis  we review the economic feasibility and the current financial  legislative and development status of the project 
if our analysis indicates that the project is no longer economically feasible then the note receivable would be written down to its estimated fair value 
revenue recognition we record revenues from casino operations  management fees  and interest on notes receivable on the accrual basis as earned 
the dates on which payments are collected may vary depending upon the term of the contracts or note receivable agreements 
interest income related to notes receivable is recorded when earned and its collectibility is reasonably certain 
the retail value of food and beverage and other services furnished to guests without charge is included in gross revenue and deducted as promotional allowances 
net revenues do not include the retail amount of food  beverage and other items provided gratuitously to customers 
we record the redemption of coupons and points for cash as a reduction of revenue 
these amounts are included in promotional allowances in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the estimated cost of providing such complimentary services that is included in casino expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations was as follows fiscal year ended april  april  food and beverage other total cost of complimentary services commitments and contengencies we rent office space in houston  texas  under a non cancelable operating lease which expires on march  the annual rent for the office space is  also  we lease through our wholly owned subsidiary  colorado grande enterprises  inc a portion of a building in cripple creek  colorado  and an adjacent parking lot  for use in connection with the colorado grande casino facilities 
we lease this property at an annual rent of the greater of  or of colorado grande cripple creek s adjusted gross gaming revenues  as defined  with an annual cap of  this lease is for an initial term of fifteen years with an option to renew for fifteen years with the final option period concluding january  on july   we exercised the option to extend the lease to january on april   we extended the lease to january at a flat annual rent of  from february through january as a result of acquiring the washington i facilities in washington state  the crazy moose casino mountlake terrace has a building lease which expires may  with an annual rent of  in the current year  with  per year going forward  with an option to renew for additional terms of three years and the following five years 
in addition  the crazy moose casino pasco has a parking lot lease which expires december  with an annual rent of  as a result of acquiring the washington ii mini casinos  the building leases are as follows silver dollar casino in seatac expires in may with an option to renew for an additional years  annual rentals are  silver dollar casino in renton expires in april with an option to renew for two additional terms of up to years  annual rentals are silver dollar casino in bothell expires in april with an option to renew for two additional terms of up to years  annual rentals are club hollywood casino in shoreline two leases  building and parking lot expires in march with options to renew for up to four additional five year terms  annual rentals are  golden nugget casino in tukwila expires in november with an option to renew for an additional year term  annual rentals are royal casino in everett expires in january with an option to renew for up to four additional five year terms  annual rentals are  and administrative offices renton  washington expires in december  annual rentals are  accrued jackpot liability we accrue slot jackpot liability as games are played under a matching concept of coin in 
in addition  as of april  and  we also maintained approximately  and  respectively  in player supported jackpot accrued liability  which are progressive games that customers fund and when a jackpot is hit it is paid from reserved funds 
income taxes income taxes are accounted using an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for income taxes 
under this approach  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on anticipated future tax consequences  using currently enacted tax laws  attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis 
we record current income taxes based on our current taxable income  and we provide for deferred income taxes to reflect estimated future tax payments and receipts 
we account for tax credits under the flow through method  which reduces the provision for income taxes in the year the tax credits first become available 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  based on our estimates  it is more likely than not that a portion of those assets will not be realized in a future period 
the estimates utilized in recognition of deferred tax assets are subject to revision  either up or down  in future periods based on new facts or circumstances 
to fully recognize our net deferred tax assets  we must achieve future taxable income of approximately million 
we have federal net operating losses of approximately million and state net operating losses of approximately million which expire from a summary of our deferred tax assets and liabilities is presented in the table below april  april  deferred tax assets net operating loss carryforwards fixed assets stock options impairment of notes receivable and goodwill other total deferred tax assets deferred tax liabilities amortization of intangibles revenue not recognized for tax reporting and other total deferred tax liabilities net deferred tax assets before valuation allowance valuation allowance net deferred tax assets accrued litigation liability we assess our exposure to loss contingencies including legal matters 
if the potential loss is justified to be probable and estimable  we will provide for the exposure 
if the actual loss from a contingency differs from management s estimate  operating results could be impacted 
as of april   we did not record any accrued litigation liability 
fair value u 
s 
generally accepted accounting principles defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and establishes a three level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements 
the valuation hierarchy categorizes assets and liabilities measured at fair value into one of three different levels depending on the observability of the inputs employed in the measurement 
the three levels are as follows level observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets at the measurement date for identical  unrestricted assets or liabilities 
level other inputs that are observable directly or indirectly such as quoted prices in markets that are not active  or inputs which are observable  either directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability 
level unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and which we make our own assumptions about how market participants would price the assets and liabilities 
stock based compensation under asc topic  compensation stock compensation  the fair value and compensation expense of each option award is estimated as of the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing formula 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock over a preceding period commensurate with the expected term of the option 
the expected term of the option is an estimate of the period of time that the option is expected to be outstanding and is based on our historical experience 
the risk free rate for the expected term of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected dividend yield was not considered in the option pricing formula since we historically have not paid dividends and have no current plans to do so in the future 
the compensation cost related to these share based awards is recognized over the requisite service period 
the requisite service period is generally the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award

net revenues for the quarter were million  our highest of the fiscal year  offset by total operating expenses of million 
net interest expense was million 
our income before income tax expense was million  or per share 
the income tax expense is million  resulting in net income of million  or per share 
the adjusted ebitda to net income reconciliation for the quarter is included in non gaap financial measures described below 
comparison of fiscal years ended april  and april  net revenues 
net revenues for fiscal year increased  or million  to million compared to fiscal year casino revenues increased million due to the addition of washington ii and an increased drop and hold percentage at the washington i mini casinos 
food and beverage revenues increased million due to the addition of six restaurants at washington ii 
other revenues increased million mainly due to the additional commission revenue for atm s  check cashing  and vending as well as retail  pull tabs  and other revenue at washington ii 
this was offset by a million increase in promotional allowances due to the additional casino operations  and the loss of  of management fees due to the suncruz bankruptcy 
total operating expenses 
total operating expenses for fiscal year increased  or million  to million compared to fiscal year operating expenses  excluding prior year write offs and impairments  increased million mainly due to the addition of washington ii 
operating expenses specifically related to the casinos increased million  food and beverage expenses increased million  marketing and administrative increased million in tandem with the increase in revenue  and facility operations expenses increased million compared to as a result of the additional six casinos in washington state 
we also saw an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million directly related to a million annualized amortization of intangible assets from the washington ii purchase 
we experienced a million decrease or less corporate expense primarily due to a decrease of employee benefits and related costs 
legal expenses for fiscal year increased  or million  to million compared to fiscal year the increase is primarily attributed to legal costs incurred in the acquisition of the six mini casinos in july  the increases in operating expenses were offset by the impairment of the colorado grande goodwill of million  a valuation allowance of million against the route settlement receivable  and a  write off of our remaining unamortized investment in suncruz in  compared to a current year write off of  related to licensing costs in mississippi 
interest income  interest expense  and amortization of loan issue costs 
interest expense for fiscal year increased  or million  to million compared to fiscal year the increase is primarily the result of a higher debt balance caused by the acquisition of the new washington casinos 
interest income for fiscal year decreased  or  to million compared to fiscal year  mainly due to the lack of interest income from the project fund that was used for the washington ii casino acquisition 
in  we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of  related to the new note with our senior lender 
amortization of loan issue cost was  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
other non operating income and expenses 
during fiscal year  we recorded a million pre tax gain related to additional proceeds received from the sale of our equity interest in the isle of capri black hawk 
we had no significant gains or losses in income taxes 
the abnormal effective rate for the twelve month period ended april resulted from the receipt of a federal tax refund of  in excess of the estimated amount  recognition of a  receivable for an estimated state refund offset by recognition of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets of  the net effect on earnings per share from these tax benefits was 
the federal refund related to the carryback of our fiscal loss to our federal income tax return which was impacted by the federal surtax paid on taxable income in excess of million during the carryback period 
the state refund is due to the impact on state tax returns of adjustments made to our federal tax returns for tax years and which is the result of a current year examination by the internal revenue service 
the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets was established to reflect management s assessment that it is more likely than not certain tax assets will not be realized 
net loss 
fiscal year reflects a net loss of million compared to a net loss of million for fiscal year the improvement of million is primarily related to the million after tax impact of impairment of assets recorded in  the million after tax impact on gain on sale of equity investments received in  the million after tax impact of increased net interest expense  million net after tax earnings from additional operating facilities  and the recognition of million abnormal tax benefit 
the effective tax rate for fiscal years and was a benefit of and  respectively 
non gaap financial measures the term adjusted ebitda is used by us in presentations  quarterly earnings calls  and other instances as appropriate 
adjusted ebitda is defined as net income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  non cash goodwill and other long lived asset impairment charges  litigation charges  non cash foreign currency transaction gains and losses and net losses gains from asset dispositions 
adjusted ebitda also excludes write offs of project development costs 
adjusted ebitda is presented because it is a required component of financial ratios reported by us to our lenders  and it is also frequently used by securities analysts  investors  and other interested parties  in addition to and not in lieu of us generally accepted accounting procedures gaap results to compare to the performance of other companies who also publicize this information 
adjusted ebitda is not a measurement of financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as alternative to net income as an indicator of our operating performance or any other measure of performance derived in accordance with gaap 
the following table shows adjusted ebitda by segment for april  and april  for the fiscal year ended april  colorado grande ng washington i ng washington ii corporate other total operations revenues gross revenues less promotional allowances net revenues expenses total operating expenses excludes depreciation  amortization  write downs  and impairments adjusted ebitda for the fiscal year ended april  colorado grande ng washington i corporate other total operations revenues gross revenues less promotional allowances net revenues expenses total operating expenses excludes depreciation  amortization  write downs  and impairments adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda reconciliation for the three months and fiscal years ended april  and adjusted ebitda reconciliation to net income loss for the quarter ended april  april  net income loss add income tax expense benefit net interest expense gain on sale of assets depreciation and amortization impairments and write offs adjusted ebitda adjusted ebitda reconciliation to net loss for the fiscal year ended april  april  net loss add income tax benefit net interest expense gain on sale of assets depreciation and amortization impairments and write offs adjusted ebitda liquidity and capital resources historical cash flows the following table sets forth our consolidated net cash provided by used in operating  investing and financing activities for fiscal years and fiscal years ended april  april  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities during fiscal year improved million compared to fiscal year this increase resulted from improved operating results of washington i casinos and the acquisitions of the washington ii casinos 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal year decreased to million cash used compared to million used in during fiscal year the decrease of funds used is primarily due to the use of million to acquire three mini casinos in fiscal the  proceeds from sale of assets include the  received from the final isle of capri black hawk disbursement and  received from the sale of a right of way on the colorado land held for sale 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for fiscal year compared to million net cash used in financing activities for fiscal year during fiscal year  we acquired treasury stock at a cost of million  and paid million in loan issuance costs 
in  we had net proceeds from short term loans of  future sources and uses of cash we expect that our future liquidity and capital requirements will be affected by capital requirements related to future acquisitions  cash flow from acquisitions  new management contracts  working capital requirements  possible loss of tukwila operation due to an ordinance that prohibits social card rooms as commercial businesses effective january   which management does not believe will have a material effect see regulations and licensing  obtaining funds via long term debt instruments  debt service requirements  and disposition of non gaming related assets at april   outstanding indebtedness was million  of which million is due may  million is due july  and the remaining million is due june we anticipate the acquired mini casinos in washington state will generate sufficient cash flows to service our debt 
the acres in black hawk  co is currently for sale 
if the acreage is sold we will use the proceeds to reduce debt 
on april   excluding restricted cash of million  we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
the restricted cash consists of approximately million of player supported jackpots psj and  of reserve funds in accordance with the lending agreement for washington ii 
our consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will have adequate availability of cash resources to satisfy our liabilities in the normal course of business 
we have made  and are in the process of making  arrangements to ensure that we have sufficient working capital to fund our obligations as they come due 
these potential funding transactions include divesting of non core assets and obtaining long term financing 
we believe that some or all of these sources of funds will be funded in a timely manner and will provide sufficient working capital for us to meet our obligations as they come due  however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in divesting of the non core assets or achieving the desired level of working capital at terms that are favorable to us 
should cash resources not be sufficient to meet our current obligations as they come due  repay or refinance our long term debt and  acquire operations that generate positive cash flow  we would be required to curtail our activities and grow at a pace that cash resources could support which may require a restructuring of our debt or selling core assets 
indebtedness effective july   we issued a million promissory note with our senior lender that replaced the million loan agreement with the same lender 
the principal bore interest at per annum through june  then increased to until the maturity date of june  the loan is secured by specific assets of the company 
as of april   we had million in outstanding debt under the promissory note 
in may  with the acquisition of the washington i mini casinos  we added million in debt 
the principal bears interest at per annum  is paid quarterly  and has a maturity date of may  in july   we added million in debt for the washington ii acquisition 
the principal bears interest at day libor plus  with a day libor floor of interest rate  is paid monthly  and has a maturity date of july  our total indebtedness at april  is million 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
new accounting pronouncements issued as of april   there are several new accounting standards and interpretations effective 
below is a discussion of significant standards that may impact us 
consolidations in december  the fasb issued accounting standards update asu  consolidations topic improvements to financial reporting by enterprises involved with variable interest entities  which codified the previously issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r 
asu changes the consolidation analysis for variable interest entities vies and requires a qualitative analysis to determine the primary beneficiary of the vie 
the determination of the primary beneficiary of a vie is based on whether the entity has the power to direct matters which most significantly impact the activities of the vie and has the obligation to absorb losses  or the right to receive benefits  of the vie which could potentially be significant to the vie 
the asu requires an ongoing reconsideration of the primary beneficiary and also amends the events triggering a reassessment of whether an entity is a vie 
asu requires additional disclosures for vies  including disclosures about a reporting entity s involvement with vies  how a reporting entity s involvement with a vie affects the reporting entity s financial statements  and significant judgments and assumptions made by the reporting entity to determine whether it must consolidate the vie 
asu was effective for us beginning may  our adoption of asu did not have a material effect on our financial statements 
accruals for casino jackpot liabilities in april   the fasb issued asu no 
 entertainment casinos topic accruals for casino jackpot liabilities 
the guidance clarifies that an entity should not accrue jackpot liabilities or portions thereof before a jackpot is won if the entity can avoid paying that jackpot since the machine can legally be removed from the gaming floor without payment of the base amount 
jackpots should be accrued and charged to revenue when an entity has the obligation to pay the jackpot 
this guidance applies to both base jackpots and the incremental portion of progressive jackpots 
the guidance is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  this guidance should be applied by recording a cumulative effect adjustment to opening retained earnings in the period of adoption 
our current accounting policy conforms to the new guidance and as such we do not expect the adoption to have a material effect on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk not required for smaller reporting companies
