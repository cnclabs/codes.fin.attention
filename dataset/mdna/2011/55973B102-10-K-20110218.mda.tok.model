general and business overview we are an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  development and production of oil and natural gas  primarily in west virginia  north dakota  texas and louisiana 
we are presently active in three of the most prolific shale resource plays in the united states  namely the marcellus shale  eagle ford shale and williston basin bakken shale 
the company is a delaware corporation and was incorporated in in  magnum hunter began oil and gas operations under the name petro resources corporation 
in may  magnum hunter restructured its management team and refocused its business strategy  and in july changed its name to magnum hunter resources corporation 
the company s new management implemented a business strategy consisting of exploiting the company s inventory of lower risk drilling locations and the acquisition of undeveloped leases and long lived proved reserves with significant exploitation and development opportunities primarily located in unconventional resource plays 
as a result of this strategy  the company has substantially increased its assets and production base through a combination of acquisitions and ongoing development drilling efforts  the company s percentage of operated properties has increased significantly  its inventory of acreage and drilling locations in resource plays has grown and its management team has been expanded 
recently  management has focused on further developing and exploiting unconventional resource plays  the acquisition of additional operated properties and the development of associated midstream opportunities directly related to these regions 
recap and outlook acquisition of triad energy assets

the majority of future lease expirations across the acquired acreage can be extended through a manageable drilling program which is planned for early the company s proved reserves at december  included approximately bcfe associated with the properties acquired in the first phase of the transaction 
pending ngas resources acquisition 
on december   the company entered into an arrangement agreement with ngas resources  inc  a british columbia corporation  which we refer to as ngas  pursuant to which the company will acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity of ngas 
ngas is an independent exploration and production company focused on unconventional natural gas plays in the eastern united states  principally in the southern appalachian basin the huron and weir shales in kentucky 
the proposed acquisition will be implemented pursuant to a court approved plan of arrangement under british columbia law 
under the plan of arrangement  each common share of ngas will be transferred to the company for the right to receive shares of the company s common stock 
upon closing of the transaction  magnum hunter will issue approximately million common shares to the ngas shareholders  representing i approximately of magnum hunter s fully diluted common shares outstanding as of february  such percentage assuming completion of both the ngas acquisition and the pending nuloch resources inc acquisition described below or ii approximately of magnum hunter s fully diluted common shares outstanding as of february  such percentage assuming completion of the ngas acquisition but not the pending nuloch resources inc acquisition 
certain ngas liabilities will be refinanced under a new senior credit facility to be provided to the company by bmo capital markets 
in connection with the pending nuloch resources inc acquisition  the company received a commitment for the new senior credit facility  which will have an initial borrowing base of million  assuming completion of both acquisitions 
the ngas assets to be acquired by the company include proved reserves of bcfe as of december  natural gas and proved developed producing  long lived reserves with an r p ratio of years  daily production of approximately mmcfe as of september  and approximately  gross lease acres undeveloped in kentucky 
as of february   information with respect to ngas s proved reserves as of december  was not yet available 

table of contents the ngas acquisition requires approval of ngas shareholders  and is subject to customary closing conditions 
the ngas acquisition is scheduled to close on or about march   although there is no assurance that the acquisition will ultimately be consummated 
pending nuloch resources acquisition 
on january   the company entered into an arrangement agreement among the company  mhr exchangeco corporation  a newly formed corporation existing under the laws of the province of alberta and an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company  which we refer to as exchangeco  and nuloch resources inc  a corporation existing under the laws of the province of alberta  which we refer to as nuloch  pursuant to which the company through exchangeco will acquire all of the issued and outstanding equity of nuloch 
nuloch is a canadian public oil and natural gas producer with headquarters in calgary  alberta 
the proposed acquisition will be implemented pursuant to a court approved plan of arrangement under alberta law 
the arrangement will involve an exchange of nuloch s common shares to the company for shares of the company s common stock and or exchangeable shares of exchangeco  as described below 
pursuant to the plan of arrangement  holders of nuloch shares who are residents of canada will receive  at the holder s election  i a number of exchangeable shares equal to the number of nuloch shares exchanged multiplied by the exchange ratio of  ii a number of magnum hunter common shares equal to the number of nuloch shares exchanged multiplied by the exchange ratio  or iii a combination of exchangeable shares and magnum hunter common shares as described in clauses i and ii above 
holders of nuloch shares who are non canadian residents will receive a number of magnum hunter common shares equal to the number of nuloch shares exchanged multiplied by the exchange ratio 
the exchangeable shares will be exchangeable into magnum hunter common shares on a share for share basis and will carry voting and dividend distribution rights which are designed to put holders of the exchangeable shares in the same functional and economic position as holders of magnum hunter common shares 
any exchangeable shares not previously exchanged will be automatically exchanged for magnum hunter common shares on the one year anniversary of the closing date of the proposed transaction  unless the company exchanges them earlier upon the occurrence of certain events

the nuloch acquisition is also subject to customary closing conditions 
the nuloch acquisition is scheduled to close no later than may   although there is no assurance that the acquisition will ultimately be consummated 
divestiture of west texas cinco terry assets 
on october   we sold our non operated interest in the cinco terry property located in crockett county  texas  to the operator of the property  for million in cash before closing adjustments 
the effective date of the transaction was october  the net proceeds of the sale were used to pay down outstanding debt under our credit agreement 
senior credit facility 
on february   we amended and restated our credit agreement to provide for a borrowing base of million  increased from million to allow for the acquisition of the triad energy assets 
on may   we entered into an amendment of the credit agreement 
the amendment increased our borrowing base from million to million 
the amendment also released eureka hunter pipeline  llc  referred to as eureka hunter  as a guarantor and pledgor under the credit agreement 
on november   we entered into a second amendment to the credit agreement  referred to as the second amendment 
the second amendment established the tranche a portion of the company s borrowing base at million due to the sale of our cinco terry properties and established the tranche b portion of the borrowing 
table of contents base at million 
this reflected an increase in the company s total borrowing base from million to million 
the second amendment also designated eureka hunter and any future subsidiaries of eureka hunter as restricted subsidiaries for purposes of the credit agreement  and amended certain negative covenants of the credit agreement to reflect such subsidiaries designation as restricted subsidiaries 
the second amendment continues to permit the company to make certain investments in eureka hunter 
pursuant to the second amendment  the lenders made a tranche b term loan to the company in the amount of million associated with the eureka hunter pipeline 
the tranche b loan bears interest  which is payable not less frequently than quarterly  at the rate of per annum and is due and payable in full on the final maturity date of november   referred to as the tranche b maturity date  subject to required prepayments as a result of reductions in the tranche b borrowing base as set forth below 
prior to the tranche b maturity date  any increase in the tranche a portion of the company s borrowing base as a result of a redetermination of the borrowing base that results in the tranche a portion exceeding million will automatically and permanently reduce the amount of the tranche b portion of the borrowing base by the amount of such increase in the tranche a portion on a dollar for dollar basis 
also  prior to the tranche b maturity date  the tranche b portion of the borrowing base will be automatically and permanently reduced by a specified percentage of any net cash proceeds from the sale of certain capital assets  or from the issuance  incurrence or assumption of certain debt for borrowed money  relating to the company s eureka hunter pipeline 
the tranche b portion of the borrowing base is principally intended to be utilized to fund the company s development of the eureka hunter pipeline 
in connection with the pending nuloch acquisition  magnum hunter has received a commitment for a new million amended and restated senior credit facility with an initial borrowing base of million to be provided by bmo capital markets  secured by the company s existing asset base  including the assets being acquired from nuloch and ngas 
redemption of series b preferred stock 
on june   the company redeemed  shares of its series b redeemable convertible preferred stock  referred to as the series b preferred stock  for the aggregate amount of million 
we had the right to redeem all outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock if magnum hunter s common shares average trading price equaled or exceeded per share for five consecutive trading days 
our common share average trading price per share met this criteria as of may  in connection with the redemption  a holder of the series b preferred stock converted  shares of series b preferred stock into shares of our restricted common stock 
as a result  all outstanding shares of the series b preferred stock have been retired 
equity financings 
we raised substantial cash through equity transactions in those transactions included million of common equity financings throughout the course of the year 
million in gross proceeds from the issuance of our series c cumulative perpetual preferred stock  at a price of per share 
we incurred costs of million to issue those shares 
million in gross proceeds from the exercise of warrants and stock options during shale resource play properties appalachian basin marcellus shale 
in the appalachian basin  we currently operate approximately  wells primarily conventionally completed  and we own approximately  net acres  including approximately  net acres overlying the marcellus shale  as well as the shallow sandstones 
approximately of our leases are held by production 
our currently producing wells are oil wells  and of the wells are operated by the company 
we plan to expand our marcellus shale development program in we have budgeted million for the drilling of gross net horizontal wells 
south texas eagle ford shale 
at february  we had approximately  gross acres approximately  net primarily targeting the eagle ford shale in south texas 
we have budgeted million in 
table of contents capital expenditures for associated with leasing new acreage and the drilling of gross net horizontal wells 
williston basin bakken shale 
we own an approximately average  non operated working interest in fields located in the williston basin in north dakota comprising wells and approximately  gross  net acres 
approximately of these leases  which are located in burke  renville  ward  bottineau  and mchenry counties  north dakota  are held by production 
we exited producing approximately bbls per day equivalent from these properties 
other properties south louisiana east chalkley our east chalkley field is located in cameron parish  louisiana 
the unit consists of approximately gross acres 
this developmental project is an exploitation of bypassed oil reserves remaining in a natural gas field located at depths between  and  feet 
at december   proved reserves on an sec basis were mboe  consisting of oil and proved developed 
our proved reserves on a nymex strip basis were mboe 
the company operates east chalkley and owns an approximately working interest and a net revenue interest 
we have not allocated any capital exploration budget for this project in and are actively seeking to divest this non core asset 
east texas surprise the surprise project is located in nacogdoches county  texas with natural gas potential from multiple horizons including james lime  pettit  travis peak  expanded bossier  cotton valley  and haynesville shale formations 
the prospect area consists of approximately  gross net acres  and we have a working interest and a net revenue interest in the prospect 
we currently do not have any capital allocated to this project or area for other in addition to our unconventional and other conventional properties  we have approximately  gross  net undeveloped acres in new mexico  kentucky and utah 
we do not currently plan to allocate any of our capital expenditure budget to these areas for eureka hunter midstream the acquisition of assets from triad energy included important infrastructure assets for the effective development of the company s marcellus shale unconventional resources 
with increased drilling activity in the region  relying on third party oilfield service providers and pipeline operators can be costly 
access to a pipeline system is vital to flow natural gas to sales and often is a deciding factor in drilling and production decisions 
the summary below provides a brief overview of the midstream services we operate and control 
we anticipate these assets will generate an attractive revenue stream as we actively market them to third party producers in the appalachian basin 
the eureka hunter pipeline consists of approximately miles of pipeline  gathering systems and or rights of way located in northern west virginia  in the marcellus shale 
the rights of way run through pleasants  tyler  ritchie  wetzel  marion  harrison  doddridge  lewis and monongalia counties 
we are currently constructing a new inch high pressure pipeline with up to mmcfpd of throughput capacity 
the first pipeline section of six miles was turned to sales on december  the next section of the pipeline of approximately miles  which together with the initial six mile section comprising the first phase  is expected to be completed by june  we expect to have sufficient capacity to gather significant quantities of company produced natural gas from our marcellus shale development program  as well as third party gas 
we have budgeted million to this project for which will be used for the construction of approximately six miles of main line and miles of laterals 
in december  the company entered into an agreement for the construction of a new mmcf per day capacity cryogenic natural gas processing plant 
the processing plant will process natural gas and natural gas liquids gathered on the eureka hunter pipeline 
installation and hookup of the plant will begin upon delivery of the plant  scheduled for october the plant is expected to be operational by mid year with the company s first section of the eureka hunter pipeline system operational  the purchase of the plant furthers the company s goal of becoming a fully integrated producer  gas gatherer and processor in this region 
the plant will allow us to not only 
table of contents gather and process our equity natural gas  but also to provide a conduit for other producers in the area 
we anticipate funding capital requirements for the plant through a combination of a partnership with an industry participant and or project financing 
our pending acquisition of ngas contemplates the restructuring of an existing out of market gas gathering and transportation agreement between ngas and a third party  and as part of the restructuring such third party would be granted a limited option to acquire a ownership interest in the processing plant 
we are also discussing funding arrangements for the plant with other potential industry partners 
equipment and services alpha hunter drilling as part of the acquisition of the triad energy assets  we acquired oilfield service equipment which is operated by our subsidiary  alpha hunter drilling  llc 
this equipment consists primarily of three drilling rigs  a workover rig and heavy machinery  which are used in our operations and also those of third parties 
we anticipate using our rigs to drill the vertical portions of our marcellus shale wells and then switching to larger rigs for the horizontal sections 
this flexibility is expected to reduce the overall drilling costs  as well as improve the timing of drilling activity 
as of february   two of our drilling rigs were under multi well drilling contracts to large producers in the area 
the third drilling rig will be utilized for drilling the top hole for our marcellus shale drilling program and will be leased to third party operators on the spot market 
hunter disposal typically  marcellus shale wells produce significant amounts of water that  in most cases  require disposal 
producers often remove the water in trucks for proper disposal in approved facilities 
while this method has been the only option to many producers in the appalachian basin  it adds a significant operating burden and increases costs 
our subsidiary  hunter disposal llc  owns and operates a salt water disposal facility located in ohio  with current capacity of approximately  barrels of water per month 
additionally  hunter disposal owns and operates a second commercial salt water disposal facility located in the primrose field in lee county  kentucky 
this disposal facility averages  bbls of water per month 
this facility has a capacity for increased disposal up to  barrels of water per month with minimal capital requirements 
in addition to utilizing our disposal facilities to reduce our operating costs and more importantly provide a cost efficient option to dispose of water generated from our marcellus shale drilling program  we market our disposal capabilities to third party operators 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under us gaap 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements 
oil and gas activities successful efforts accounting for oil and gas activities is subject to special  unique rules 
we use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities 
the significant principles for this method are geological and geophysical evaluation costs are expensed as incurred  dry holes for exploratory wells are expensed  and dry holes for developmental wells are capitalized  and capitalized costs related to proved oil and gas properties  including wells and related equipment and facilities  are evaluated for impairment based on an analysis of undiscounted future net cash flows in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if 
table of contents undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the net capitalized costs related to proved properties  then we recognize an impairment charge in income from operations equal to the difference between the net capitalized costs related to proved properties and their estimated fair values based on the present value of the related future net cash flows 
proved reserves on december   the sec released a final rule  modernization of oil and gas reporting  approving revisions designed to modernize oil and gas reserve reporting requirements 
the new reserve rules first became effective for our financial statements for the year ended december  and our year end proved reserve estimates 
the most significant revisions to the reporting requirements include commodity prices 
economic producibility of reserves is now based on the unweighted  arithmetic average of the closing price on the first day of the month for the month period prior to fiscal year end  unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements  undeveloped oil and gas reserves 
reserves may be classified as proved undeveloped for undrilled areas beyond one offsetting drilling unit from a producing well if there is reasonable certainty that the quantities will be recovered  reliable technology 
the rules now permit the use of new technologies to establish the reasonable certainty of proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserves volumes  unproved reserves 
probable and possible reserves may be disclosed separately on a voluntary basis  preparation of reserves estimates 
disclosure is required regarding the internal controls used to assure objectivity in the reserves estimation process and the qualifications of the technical person primarily responsible for preparing reserves estimates  and third party reports 
we are now required to file with the sec the report of any third party used to prepare or audit our reserve estimates 
in addition  in january  fasb issued accounting standards update  or the update   oil and gas reserve estimation and disclosures  to provide consistency with the new reserve rules 
the update amends existing standards to align the reserves estimation and disclosure requirements under gaap with the requirements in the sec s reserve rules 
we adopted the new standards effective december  the new standards are applied prospectively as a change in estimate 
for the year ended december   we engaged cawley  gillespie associates  inc  independent petroleum engineers  to prepare independent estimates of the extent and value of the proved reserves associated with certain of our oil and gas properties in accordance with guidelines established by the sec  including the recent revisions designed to modernize oil and gas reserve reporting requirements 
we adopted these revisions effective december  estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates including depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  evaluation of impairment of properties and the calculation of plugging and abandonment liabilities 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas  which  by analysis of geoscience and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for any reservoir may change substantially over time due to results from operational activity 
proved reserve volumes at december   were estimated based on the unweighted  arithmetic average of the closing price on the first day of each month for the month period prior to december  for oil and natural gas in accordance with the new reserve rules 
the average price used for oil was and for natural gas was

derivative instruments and commodity derivative activities unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the collar contracts using industry standard option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in gain loss on derivative contracts on our consolidated statements of operations 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties on our commodity derivatives positions and have considered the exposure in our internal valuations 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties over the term of the commodity derivatives positions 
changes in the derivative s fair value are currently recognized in the statement of operations unless specific commodity derivative hedge accounting criteria are met and such strategies are designated 
for qualifying cash flow commodity derivatives  the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss income to the extent the commodity derivative is effective 
the ineffective portion of the commodity derivative is recognized immediately in the statement of operations 
gains and losses on commodity derivative instruments included in accumulated other comprehensive loss income are reclassified to oil and gas sales revenue in the period that the related production is delivered 
derivative contracts that do not qualify for commodity derivative accounting treatment are recorded as derivative assets and liabilities at fair value in the balance sheet  and the associated unrealized gains and losses are recorded as current income or expense in the statement of operations 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
we record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled gain loss on derivative contracts 
although we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  we use those instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices related to our oil and gas production 
we record both realized and unrealized gains and losses under those instruments in other revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded i a realized gain from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december   ii a realized gain from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december  and iii a realized loss from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december  realized gains and losses result from actual cash settlements received or paid under the derivative contracts 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized gain of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
unrealized gains and losses result from changes in the fair market value of the derivative contracts from period to period  and represent non cash gains or losses 
changes in commodity prices could have a significant effect on the fair value of our derivative contracts 
a hypothetical increase in the nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december  fair value recorded on our balance sheet  and a corresponding increase to the loss on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations

table of contents asset retirement obligation our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our producing properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable federal  state and local laws 
we determine our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to the liability 
the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value as of the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to proved properties 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded as accretion expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
our liability is determined using significant assumptions  including current estimates of plugging and abandonment costs  annual inflation of these costs  the productive lives of wells and our risk adjusted interest rate 
changes in any of these assumptions can result in significant revisions to the estimated asset retirement obligation 
our liability for asset retirement obligations was approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
see note asset retirement obligations to our consolidated financial statements for more information 
share based compensation our stock incentive plan allows grants of stock  options  and other stock based awards to employees and outside directors 
grants of awards may increase our general and administrative expenses subject to the size and timing of the grants 
for the years ended december    and  we recognized approximately million  million  and million in non cash stock compensation  respectively 
see note share based compensation to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
valuation of property and equipment the company accounts for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with asc  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
asc requires that the company s long lived assets  including its oil and gas properties  be assessed for potential impairment in their carrying values whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such impairment may have occurred 
an impairment charge to current operations is recognized when the estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the asset are less than its carrying value 
any such impairment is recognized based on the differences in the carrying value and estimated fair value of the impaired asset 
the guidance provides for future revenue from the company s oil and gas production to be estimated based upon prices at which management reasonably estimates such products will be sold 
these estimates of future product prices may differ from current market prices of oil and gas 
any downward revisions to management s estimates of future production or product prices could result in an impairment of the company s oil and gas properties in subsequent periods 
the long lived assets of the company which are subject to evaluation consist primarily of oil and gas properties 
due to the regularly scheduled impairment reviews by management  the company recognized a non cash  pre tax charge against earnings of approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
revenue recognition revenues associated with sales of crude oil  natural gas  natural gas liquids and petroleum products  and other items are recognized when title passes to the customer  which is when the risk of ownership passes to the purchaser and physical delivery of goods occurs  either immediately or within a fixed delivery schedule that is reasonable and customary in the industry 
revenues from the production of natural gas and crude oil properties in which we have an interest with other producers are recognized based on the actual volumes we sold during the period 
any differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes  based on our net working interest  which are deemed to be non recoverable through 
table of contents remaining production  are recognized as accounts receivable or accounts payable  as appropriate 
cumulative differences between volumes sold and entitlement volumes are generally not significant 
revenues from field servicing activities are recognized at the time the services are provided and earned as provided in the various contract agreements 
gas gathering revenues are recognized at the time the natural gas is delivered at the destination point 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we measure and record income tax contingency accruals in accordance with asc  income taxes 
we recognize liabilities for uncertain income tax positions based on a two step process 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step requires us to estimate and measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement 
it is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts  as we must determine the probability of various possible outcomes 
we reevaluate these uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis or when new information becomes available to management 
these reevaluations are based on factors including  but not limited to  changes in facts or circumstances  changes in tax law  successfully settled issues under audit  expirations due to statutes  and new audit activity 
such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an increase to the tax accrual 
we classify interest related to income tax liabilities as income tax expense  and if applicable  penalties are recognized as a component of income tax expense 
the income tax liabilities and accrued interest and penalties that are anticipated to be due within one year of the balance sheet date are presented as current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
see note income taxes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued asc  improving disclosures about fair value measurements asc 
these new disclosures require entities to separately disclose amounts of significant transfers in and out of level and level fair value measurements and the reasons for the transfers 
in addition  in the reconciliation for fair value measurements for level  entities should present separate information about purchases  sales  issuances  and settlements 
this guidance is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   except for the disclosures about purchases  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
our adoption of the disclosures  excluding the level activity disclosures  did not have a material impact on our notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
see note fair value of financial instruments for additional information 
we are still evaluating the impact of the level disclosure requirements on our notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued asc  amendments to certain recognition and disclosure requirements  related to subsequent events under asc  subsequent events 
this guidance states that if an entity is and sec filer  it is required to evaluate subsequent events for disclosure through the date that the financial statements are issued 
we adopted this guidance as of february and have included the required disclosures in our condensed consolidated financial statements

effects of inflation inflation in the united states has been relatively low in recent years and did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december    and although the impact of inflation has 
table of contents been insignificant in recent years  it is still a factor in the united states economy and may increase the cost to acquire or replace property  plant and equipment 
it may also increase the cost of labor or supplies 
to the extent permitted by competition  regulation and our existing agreements  we have and will continue to pass along increased costs to our customers in the form of higher prices

production increased by mboe to mboe for the year ended december  from mboe for the year ended december   or 
production for on a boe basis was oil and natural gas compared to oil and natural gas for the change in the percent of oil and gas produced was due to the acquisition of triad energy s assets in february our average daily production on a boe basis was  boe per day during compared to boe per day for the year representing an overall increase of boe per day giving effect to the company s sale in october of its cinco terry property as if such sale occurred at the beginning of each such period 
the increase in production in compared to is primarily attributable to the acquisition of the triad energy assets which closed in february and continuing exploration and development efforts in other fields 
triad accounted for mboe of the increase in production in 
table of contents other fields where production increased were eagleville eagle ford shale with a mboe increase  south caesar with a mboe increase  south texas with a mboe increase  east chalkley with a mboe increase  and williston with a mboe increase 
the eagleville and south caesar increases were due to success in our exploratory drilling program 
the increases in south texas and east chalkley were to acquisition of property interests 
the increase in williston production was due to increased response from our unitization and secondary recovery program and drilling program 
we experienced a mboe decrease in production at our surprise field due to natural decline 
oil and gas sales 
oil and gas sales increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in oil and gas sales principally resulted from increases in our oil and natural gas production due to increased acquisition activity and exploratory drilling efforts throughout the year

liquidity and capital resources we generally rely on cash generated from operations  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and  to the extent that credit and capital market conditions will allow  future public and private equity and debt offerings to satisfy our liquidity needs

off balance sheet arrangements from time to time  we enter into off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that can give rise to off balance sheet obligations 
as of december   the off balance sheet arrangements and transactions that we have entered into include undrawn letters of credit and operating lease agreements 
we do not believe that these 
table of contents arrangements are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or availability of  or requirements for  capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk some of the information below contains forward looking statements 
the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and other related factors 
the disclosure is not meant to be a precise indicator of expected future losses  but rather an indicator of reasonable possible losses 
this forward looking information provides an indicator of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for commodity derivative and investment purposes  not for trading purposes 
proved reserves estimates of proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates including depletion  depreciation and amortization expense  evaluation of impairment of properties and the calculation of plugging and abandonment liabilities 
proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which  by analysis of geosciences and engineering data  can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible from a given date forward  from known reservoirs  and under existing economic conditions  operating methods  and government regulations 
the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for any reservoir may change substantially over time due to results from operational activity 
proved reserve volumes at december  were estimated based on the unweighted  arithmetic average of the closing price on the first day of each month for the month period prior to december  for natural gas  oil  and ngls  in accordance with new reserve rules 
changes in commodity prices and operation costs may also affect the overall evaluation of reservoirs 
a hypothetical decline in our december  estimated proved reserves would have increased our depletion expense by approximately million for the year ended december  commodity price risk given the current economic outlook  we expect commodity prices to remain volatile 
even modest decreases in commodity prices can materially affect our revenues and cash flow 
in addition  if commodity prices remain suppressed for a significant amount of time  we could be required under successful efforts accounting rules to write down our oil and gas properties 
we enter into financial swaps and collars to reduce the risk of commodity price fluctuations 
we do not designate such instruments as cash flow hedges 
accordingly  we record open commodity derivative positions on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value and recognize changes in such fair values as income expense on our consolidated statements as they occur

bank of montreal is currently the only counterparty to our commodity derivatives positions 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty on our commodity derivative positions 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparty over the terms of the commodity derivatives positions 
bank of montreal is the administrative agent and a participant in our revolving credit facility  and the collateral for the outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility is used as collateral for our commodity derivatives 
unrealized gains and losses  at fair value  are included on our consolidated balance sheets as current or non current assets or liabilities based on the anticipated timing of cash settlements under the related contracts 
changes in the fair value of our commodity derivative contracts are recorded in earnings as they occur and included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate the fair values of swap contracts based on the present value of the difference in exchange quoted forward price curves and contractual settlement prices multiplied by notional quantities 
we internally valued the collar  call  and put contracts using industry standard 
table of contents option pricing models and observable market inputs 
we use our internal valuations to determine the fair values of the contracts that are reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
realized gains and losses are also included in other income expense on our consolidated statements of operations 
historically  we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
we record our open derivative instruments at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets as either unrealized gains or losses on commodity derivatives 
we record changes in such fair value in earnings on our consolidated statements of operations under the caption entitled gain loss on derivative contracts 
although we have not designated our derivative instruments as cash flow hedges  we use those instruments to reduce our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices related to our oil and gas production 
we record both realized and unrealized gains and losses under those instruments in other revenues on our consolidated statements of operations 
we recorded i a realized gain from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december   ii a realized gain from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december   and iii a realized loss from the settlement of derivative contracts of million for the year ended december  realized gains and losses result from actual cash settlements received or paid under the derivative contracts 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized loss of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
for the year ended december   we recognized an unrealized gain of million from the change in the fair value of commodity derivatives 
unrealized gains and losses result from changes in the fair market value of the derivative contracts from period to period  and represent non cash gains or losses 
changes in commodity prices could have a significant effect on the fair value of our derivative contracts 
a hypothetical increase in the nymex floating prices would have resulted in a million decrease in the december  fair value recorded on our balance sheet  and a corresponding increase to the loss on commodity derivatives in our statement of operations 
see note summary of significant accounting policies  note fair value of financial instruments  and note financial instruments and derivatives to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our derivative instruments 
to estimate the fair value of our commodity derivatives positions  we use market data or assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
we primarily apply the market approach for recurring fair value measurements and attempt to use the best available information 
we determine the fair value based upon the hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurement and lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurement 
the three levels of fair value hierarchy are as follows level quoted prices are available in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date 
at december   we had no level measurements 
level pricing inputs are other than quoted prices in active markets included in level  which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date 
level includes those financial instruments that are valued using models or other valuation methodologies 
these models are primarily industry standard models that consider various assumptions  including quoted forward prices for commodities  time value  volatility factors and current market and contractual prices for the underlying instruments  as well as other relevant economic measures 
our derivatives  which consist primarily of commodity swaps and collars  are valued using commodity market data which is derived by combining raw inputs and quantitative models and processes to generate forward curves 
where observable inputs are available  directly or indirectly  for substantially the full term of the asset or liability  the instrument is categorized in level at december   all of our commodity derivatives were valued using level measurements 
level pricing inputs include significant inputs that are generally less observable from objective sources 
these inputs may be used with internally developed methodologies that result in management s best estimate of fair value 
at december   our level measurements were used to calculate our asset retirement obligation and our impairment analysis of proved properties at december
