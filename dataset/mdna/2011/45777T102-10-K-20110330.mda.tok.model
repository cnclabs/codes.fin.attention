table of contents in and out licensing online marketplaces partner search and profiling strategies to drive our growth into the future we remain focused on growing our business with the objectives of improving our financial results and generating returns for our shareholders 
we continue to focus on delivering strong financial performance in both the near term and the long term 
we have identified the following four key challenges and related strategic business imperatives that we believe will enable us to drive growth into the future 
continue to develop our innovation management software platform our first imperative is to continue to develop our innovation management software platform 
we announced the controlled release of the first phase of our software product in december  for which we have subsequently begun testing in we anticipate the controlled release of two additional phases of the software product during  thereby expanding the product capability further into the innovation cycle process 
the full scale release of the complete product is dependent on the results of our testing procedures  which is dependent on the use of third party consultants 
over time  we expect the software product component of our business to grow at a greater rate than the growth in our current business segments until it represents an important component of our overall revenue stream 
a key component of our strategy is to embrace both software and information offerings from other firms through an open innovation approach 
using this approach  our clients that have already begun to utilize other software and information services will be able to incorporate our offerings to suit their requirements to most effectively drive innovation 
build and expand our current consulting and technology services business our second imperative is to sustainably and profitably grow our current consulting and technology services businesses worldwide 
we have recently hired a senior vice president of sales who brings with him twenty years of global experience in technology sales at the enterprise and executive sales management level 
as the senior vice president of sales at innovaro  he will establish sales and engagement models while continuing to build upon our core pillars of business 
he will also take on identical responsibilities as we move into the future with our software product offering 
cherish our innovaro associates our third imperative is to cherish our innovaro associates 
our continued growth requires us to hire  retain and develop our leadership bench 
we are fortunate to employ  worldwide  a truly remarkable set of associates 
the market becomes more competitive every day and innovation is the key to success 
it is people who hold that key and to be a good employer is one of the most important strategic decisions a company has to make 
achieve operational excellence our fourth and final imperative is the sum total of the other three 
our continued success requires that we do everything we can to position ourselves to achieve operational excellence in each of the areas mentioned above 
by focusing on the four key challenges and related strategic business imperatives discussed above  we believe we can achieve this goal 

table of contents financial condition our total assets were million at december  compared to million at december  at december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents  million in accounts receivable  million in accounts payable and accrued expenses and million in long term debt outstanding 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents   in certificates of deposit  million in accounts receivable   in accounts payable and accrued expenses and million in long term debt outstanding 
our cash balance as of december  was significantly lower than our historical cash position 
the cash balance decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of as a result of the company having to pay bonuses to employees of its strategic services business segment in accordance with the terms of the strategos bonus plan 
we have subsequently rebuilt our cash position to approximately  as of the date of this filing 
see the liquidity section for further discussion 
current market conditions we believe that our financial results for continued to be negatively impacted by weakened economic conditions 
since mid  global credit and other financial markets have suffered substantial stress  volatility  illiquidity and disruption 
these forces reached unprecedented levels in late  resulting in the bankruptcy or acquisition of  or government assistance to  several major domestic and international financial institutions 
these events significantly diminished overall confidence in the financial markets and caused increasing global economic uncertainty 
this reduced confidence and uncertainty could further exacerbate the overall market disruptions and risks to businesses in need of capital  including us 
moreover  the deterioration in the equity markets has had a negative impact on the cash proceeds that we have been able to obtain upon the sale of our investments and has resulted in our having to recognize certain impairment losses related to decreases in the fair value of our assets 
in addition  the deterioration in consumer confidence and a general reduction in spending by consumers and business have had an adverse effect on certain of our operations as businesses have delayed spending on these types of services 
recent improvements in demand trends globally may not continue  and our future financial results and growth could be further harmed or constrained if the recovery was to stall or conditions were to worsen 
investment portfolio activity until september   we were a non diversified  closed end management investment company that had elected to be treated as a business development company bdc under the investment company act of act 
on october   because we no longer met the requirements  we filed a notification on form n c with the sec withdrawing our election to be regulated as a bdc under the act 
as such  we began reporting as an operating company as of october  in connection with our plan to de elect bdc status  we liquidated a significant portion of our investment portfolio during we sold some or all of our shares in a significant number of our portfolio companies for million in cash and other assets  which resulted in realized losses of million and unrealized appreciation of million  which is primarily related to the reversal of previously recorded unrealized depreciation upon the sale of these investments 
conversion from investment company presentation to operating company presentation the withdrawal of our election to be regulated as a bdc under the act resulted in a significant change in our method of accounting 
investment company financial statement presentation and accounting utilizes the value method of accounting used by investment companies  which requires investment companies to value their investments at market value as opposed to historical cost  and recognize income related to unrealized gains and 
table of contents losses in the current period 
as an operating company  the required financial statement presentation and accounting for investments held is either fair value or historical cost methods of accounting  depending on the classification of the investment and the company s intent with respect to the period of time it intends to hold the investment 
in addition  the financial accounts of majority owned entities were not consolidated with ours under investment company accounting  rather  investments in those entities were reflected in our balance sheet at fair value 
as an operating company  we are required to consolidate the accounts of majority owned entities in which we have a controlling financial interest with our accounts 
in this regard  the accounts of utek real estate holdings  inc  which was previously reflected as an investment at fair value in our balance sheet  have been consolidated with our accounts from october  for a detailed discussion of the impact of the withdrawal of our election to be regulated as a bdc under the act on our method of accounting and a discussion of how we account for investments as an operating company  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
results of operations for the years ended december  and for comparability purposes  the revenues and expenses for the nine months ended september  under investment company accounting and for the three months ended december  under operating company accounting are presented combined for the year ended december  in this section 
management believes this presentation is more meaningful to readers as there was no significant change in revenue streams as a result of our change in status from an investment company to an operating company 
revenue income from operations in thousands  except percentages percent change versus strategic services technology services investment income  net nm revenue this percentage change is not meaningful nm given that it relates to the manner in which we reported our operating results during the two reporting periods

strategic services our strategic services revenue is derived from consulting services we provide to our clients 
our strategic services revenue increased by million for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  this increase is the result of the company having a significant number of new contracts in the second half of we attribute the increased revenue in to a renewed interest in innovation efficiency and new product development in the us and abroad 
our strategic services revenue in recent years has largely been dependent on the efforts of certain key consulting professionals whose employment contracts with us expire in april if we are not successful in retaining these consulting professionals or timely hiring of similarly qualified and skilled consulting professionals to replace them  then we may not be able to maintain the level of strategic services revenue we have generated in recent years 

table of contents we expect strategic services revenue to remain consistent with levels  unless all or a substantial portion of the employment contracts described above are not renewed 
technology services our technology services revenue is a combination of global technology partnering search retainer fees  our online subscription fees  online information services revenue  foresight and trend research revenue and ip consulting revenue 
our technology services revenue decreased by  for the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  the decreased revenue in is primarily a result of a reduction of  in monthly fees for our global technology partnering services and a reduction of  in online marketplace fees  partially offset by a  increase in ip consulting revenue

salaries and wages in thousands  except percentages percent change versus salaries and wages as a percent of revenue ppt the abbreviation ppt throughout this section denotes percentage points 
salaries and wages include non sales employee and officer salaries that are not otherwise allocated to direct costs of revenue  employee related benefits including bonuses  and stock based compensation

we expect salaries and wages to decrease in due to a reduced number of employees over that of professional fees in thousands  except percentages percent change versus professional fees as a percent of revenue ppt professional fees include accounting fees  legal fees and valuation expenses for our investments 
professional fees decreased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  valuation expenses were reduced by  because our investments required fewer valuations in accounting fees were reduced by  as a result of our having changed to a smaller reporting company in as a smaller reporting company  we are not required to have an audit of our internal

sales and marketing expenses increased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during  we incurred  in name change costs and  in costs of partnering with external search partners to market our products on their websites 
these additional costs were offset by a decrease in sales related travel expenses of  in we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease for the year ending december  because we will not have rebranding costs or partnering costs  the latter of which have been discontinued 
general and administrative in thousands  except percentages percent change versus general and administrative as a percent of revenue ppt general and administrative expenses decreased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the decrease relates to a  reduction in insurance and payroll taxes due to having fewer employees  a  reduction in rent related to consolidating utek real estate operations  closing one of our offices in the united kingdom  closing our pennsylvania office  and reducing the amount of space leased for our washington  dc office  a  reduction in investment banking

amortization and depreciation in thousands  except percentages percent change versus amortization and depreciation as a percent of revenue ppt depreciation and amortization expense decreased by  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  amortization expense decreased  as a result of the impairment of certain definite lived intangible assets in the second quarter of and the third quarter of depreciation expense increased  as a result of the addition of million in depreciable assets from the consolidation of utek real estate in the fourth quarter of we expect amortization and depreciation for the year ending december  to decrease from as a result of impairment to certain of these assets in impairment loss in thousands  except percentages percent change versus impairment loss our stock price declined significantly subsequent to june  management considered the fact that a decline in stock price may be an indicator of an adverse change in business climate 
in addition  a decline in stock price affects market capitalization and may affect fair value measurements for our reporting units 
at the end of the third quarter of  management concluded that the decline in our stock price was other than short term in nature 
this conclusion  coupled with the severity of the decline  triggered a review for impairment outside of our next scheduled annual impairment evaluation date of december  due to the reduction in our market capitalization  third party valuations were obtained to assist in the determination of the fair value of the respective reporting units 
as a result of a reduction in the fair value of the reporting units  management determined that the implied fair value of its goodwill and intangible assets was less than its carrying values by approximately million 
we recognized goodwill impairment of approximately million and intangible assets impairment of approximately  in we also recorded impairment of approximately  to certain of our land  building and building improvements during the commercial real estate market for such property has taken a significant downturn that is not expected to reverse in the near future 
as a result  management determined that the decrease in the fair value of the property was other than temporary 
the impairment loss was determined based on third party valuations of the respective property 
in  the then existing social technologies division of innovaro had a significant decrease in revenues related to its futures and foresight projects 
the state of the economy during contributed to potential social 
table of contents technologies clients focusing on short term survival rather than long term foresight planning 
as a result  management terminated the majority of the division s employees in favor of an independent  network based approach in an effort to reduce overhead 
management concluded that this division had suffered a significant adverse change in the business  which included a projection of continuing operating and cash flow losses 
we recognized impairment of the division s purchased intangible assets of approximately million and impairment of the division s goodwill of approximately million in other income expense in thousands  except percentages percent change versus other income expense other income expense is a new line item in our statement of operations related to reporting as an operating company

income tax matters deferred taxes are provided on the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences 
temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases 
future tax benefits for net operating loss carryforwards are 
table of contents recognized to the extent that realization of these benefits is considered more likely than not 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
for federal and state income tax purposes  we are taxed at regular corporate rates on ordinary income and recognize gains on distributions of appreciated property 
as an investment company  we were not entitled to the special tax treatment available to bdcs that elect to be treated as regulated investment companies under the internal revenue code because  among other reasons  we did not distribute at least of investment company taxable income as required by the internal revenue code for such treatment 
we do not have any income tax benefit related to the net loss from operations in or  nor do we have a deferred tax asset related to our net operating loss carryforward  because of a valuation allowance

we raised gross proceeds of approximately million before advisory fees and offering expenses in connection with the offering 
research and development expenditures in the first quarter of  we began development of an innovation management software platform designed to enhance and complement our innovation services deliverable to clients 
as of december   we have invested million in this software platform 
management has begun testing and marketing the software platform in we expect to incur additional software platform costs of approximately  to commercialize all phases of the platform during borrowings as of october   the financial results of utek real estate have been consolidated with those of innovaro

these loans were entered into in connection with the purchases of land and building that serves as our company headquarters and certain other undeveloped land located in hillsborough county  florida 
these loans are collateralized by the property related to the purchases 
on october   we entered into a promissory note the note with gators lender  llc the lender  pursuant to which we borrowed  from the lender 
interest is payable at an annual rate of on a quarterly basis  in arrears  beginning april  the entire principal amount outstanding and all accrued interest is payable in full no later than october  utek real estate is a co borrower under the note and the loan is guaranteed by all subsidiaries 
in addition  the guaranty was secured pursuant to a security agreement encumbering vacant real property located in hernando county  florida the collateral  which is owned by cortez  llc cortez  a subsidiary of utek real estate

table of contents and replaced by a security interest in of the outstanding membership interests of cortez 
the note was amended and restated to provide that utek and utek real estate must pay down  of the indebtedness to the lender within days 
at our request  the lender subsequently extended the repayment date for the  payment  which was made in accordance with this extension on july  as of december   the face amount outstanding on the note was approximately million

during december  the company borrowed  for operations from one of its directors under a promissory note 
the note was subsequently repaid in full on february  including interest at and points 
this transaction is not necessarily indicative of amounts  terms and conditions that the company may have received with unrelated third parties 
cash and accounts receivable balances our cash balance as of december  was significantly lower than our historical cash position 
the cash balance decreased significantly in the fourth quarter of as a result of the company having to pay bonuses to employees in its strategic services business segment in accordance with the terms of the strategos bonus plan 
these bonuses are based on adjusted earnings of the strategic services business segment without taking into account any working capital requirements of the business segment and are required to be paid by december th  but no later than december st  of each year with respect to such year 
accounts receivable related to the strategic services business segment due within days of december  were included in the amounts eligible to be paid as bonuses under the terms of the strategos bonus plan 
as a result  we were required to pay bonuses to these employees prior to our collection of the related amounts of accounts receivable  which significantly lowered the company s cash balance as of december  we have subsequently rebuilt our cash position to approximately  as of the date of this filing 
our accounts receivable balance as of december  was significantly higher than our historical accounts receivable balance 
the increase in our accounts receivable balance during the third and fourth quarters of is a result of a significant increase in revenue 
revenue increased because the company had a significant number of new contracts in the second half of revenue for the third and fourth quarters of increased over revenue for the first and second quarters of it is not unusual for our accounts receivables balance to sustain an elevated balance during periods of increased revenues 
of the outstanding receivables balance of million at december   only  or  was overdue 
as of the date of this filing  we have collected all but  of the total accounts receivable balance outstanding at december  liquidity our primary cash requirements include working capital  research and development expenditures  principal and interest payments on indebtedness  and employee bonuses 
our primary sources of funds are cash received from customers in connection with operations and proceeds from the sale of our investments 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  and accounts receivable of million 
we had  in working capital as of december  we currently intend to fund our research and development expenditures and liquidity needs with existing cash and cash equivalent balances  cash generated from operations  collections of our existing receivables and the potential sales of our investments 
we believe that these sources will be sufficient to fund our scheduled debt service and provide required resources for working capital for the next twelve months 

table of contents as of december   our strategic services business segment had million of contracts in progress  of which million had been billed  leaving million to be billed in as of the date of this filing  this business has already secured an additional million in contracts to be fulfilled before the end of in addition  we are in the process of modifying the aforementioned strategos bonus plan to be more reflective of cash collected 
in addition to the confirmed revenue stream for  we have significantly cut our costs in each of the expense categories listed below salaries and wages million reduction  sales and marketing  reduction in non repetitive costs related to name change and partner search fees  and general and administrative  reduction in employee related costs such as health insurance  payroll taxes and retirement funding  travel expenses related to certain terminated employees  and investor relations costs 
we expect these reductions in costs  coupled with the expected revenue for  to be sufficient to fund our working capital for the next twelve months 
should we face a restricted cash flow scenario during  we have the capability to delay all cash intensive activities  including our research and development expenditures  and look to reduce costs further 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are materially likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make assessments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements 
critical accounting estimates are those that require management s most difficult  complex  or subjective judgments and have the most potential to impact our financial position and operating results 
we consider the following accounting policies and related estimates to be critical as they require the most subjective judgment or involve uncertainty that could have a material impact on our financial statements 
revenue recognition the company has revenues from fixed fee contracts for the sale of strategic consulting services 
these revenues are recognized on a pro rata basis based upon costs incurred to date compared to total estimated contract costs 
the determination of estimated contract costs is critical to the determination of revenue recognition in any given period 
if costs incurred to date are compared to total estimated contract costs that have not been updated for the most recent information  material variances in revenue recognition can occur 
as a result  management evaluates the accuracy of estimated contract costs for each in process job in light of available information regarding job status at the end of each reporting period 
in addition  management prepares an analysis to determine the accuracy of our estimated total contract costs on closed jobs 
we have historically been able to estimate total contract costs with the required accuracy to produce materially correct revenue results 
valuation and impairment of investments our investments include cost method investments  available for sale securities  and equity method investments 
the assessment of the fair value of certain of our cost method and equity method investments can 
table of contents be difficult and subjective due in part to our having only limited information on these investments 
in addition  determination of permanent impairment for available for sale securities can be difficult and subjective due in part to limited trading activity of certain of these equity instruments 
we conduct periodic reviews to identify and evaluate each investment that has an unrealized loss  in accordance with the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments  as required under current accounting standards 
an unrealized loss exists when the current fair value of an individual security is less than its amortized cost basis 
unrealized losses on available for sale securities that are determined to be temporary are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
for available for sale equity securities with unrealized losses  management performs an analysis to assess whether the security s decline in fair value would be deemed to be other than temporary 
this can be difficult as many of our holdings have limited trading activity and prices can fluctuate significantly 
fluctuations in price are generally determined to be temporary unless the price level is maintained for an extended period of time 
significant declines in a security s fair value are determined to be other than temporary when the decline is maintained over several reporting periods 
when a decline in stock price is deemed to be other than temporary  the unrealized loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss is reversed and recorded as a capital loss in the statement of operations 
our cost method investments and equity method investments are in small  privately held companies 
these investments are not publicly traded  and  therefore  because no established market for these securities exists  the estimate of the fair value of our investments requires significant judgment 
investments that are accounted for using the cost method are valued at cost unless an other than temporary impairment in their value occurs or the investment is liquidated 
for investments that are accounted for using the equity method  we record our share of the investee s operating results each period 
we review the fair value of our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether an other than temporary impairment in the investment has occurred 
we record impairment charges when we believe that an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
stock based compensation stock based compensation cost for share based payments are based on their relative grant date fair values estimated in accordance with current accounting standards 
the company recognizes compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the determination of the fair value of stock based compensation requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding assumptions such as stock price volatility  expected option lives and forfeiture rates 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
the expected term of options granted represents the period of time that the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on historical experience of similar grants  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the grants  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
the expected volatility is based upon our historical market price at consistent points in a period equal to the expected life of the options 
expected forfeitures are based on historical experience and expectations of future employee behavior 
we are required to estimate future forfeitures of stock based awards for recognition of compensation expense 
we will record additional expense if the actual forfeitures are lower than estimated and will record a recovery of prior recognized expense if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those awards that vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate or performance outcomes are materially different from our estimate  the actual stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 

table of contents valuation and impairment of goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
intangible assets represent the cost of trade marks  trade names  websites  customer lists  non compete agreements  and proprietary processes and software obtained in connection with certain of these acquisitions 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
in accordance with current accounting standards  goodwill and intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives are not subject to amortization but are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate a potential impairment may have occurred 
circumstances that may indicate impairment include qualitative factors such as an adverse change in the business climate  loss of key personnel  and unanticipated competition 
additionally  management considers quantitative factors such as current estimates of the future profitability of the company s reporting units  the current stock price  and the company s market capitalization compared to its book value 
the consideration of qualitative and quantitative factors when considering circumstances that may indicate impairment requires the application of management judgment 
as a result  management s determinations with regard to current circumstances affecting the company could have a significant affect the recognition of impairment charges 
if management determines that an impairment test is necessary  it must determine the fair value of the respective reporting units 
the determination of the fair value of reporting units requires significant judgment 
management typically enlists the assistance of a third party valuation firm in determining fair value of reporting units for use in its impairment analysis 
in conducting its impairment test  the company compares the fair value of each of its reporting units to the related book value 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its net book value  long lived assets are considered not to be impaired 
if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds it fair value  an impairment loss is measured and recognized 
the company conducts its impairment test using balances as of december the company accounts for long lived assets  including intangibles that are amortized  in accordance with gaap  which requires that all long lived assets be reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
management considers both qualitative and quantitative factors when considering circumstances that may indicate impairment 
this consideration requires significant management judgment and could have a significant affect of the recognition of impairment charges 
if indicators of impairment are present  reviews are performed to determine whether the carrying value of an asset to be held and used is impaired 
such reviews involve a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset over its remaining useful life 
the determination of future cash flows involves inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment regarding the future operations of the company 
if the comparison indicates that there is impairment  the impaired asset is written down to its fair value 
the impairment to be recognized as a non cash charge to earnings is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less cost to dispose 
valuation of derivative liabilities asc topic derivatives and hedging requires bifurcation of embedded derivative instruments and measure of their fair value for accounting purposes 
in addition  freestanding derivative instruments such as certain warrants are also derivative liabilities 
derivative liabilities are recorded at fair value at inception and then are adjusted to reflect fair value at the end of each quarter  with any increase or decrease in the fair value being recorded in results of operations as a component of other income expense 
we estimate the fair value of these instruments using the black scholes option pricing model  which takes into account a variety of factors that require judgment  including estimating the expected term of the warrants and the expected volatility of the company s stock price 
the expected term of the warrants represents the period of time that they are expected to be outstanding and is based on the contractual term of the warrants and expectations of the warrants holders 
table of contents behavior 
the expected volatility is based upon our historical market price at consistent points in a period equal to the expected life of the warrants 
these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our derivative liability and the related gain or loss could be materially different in the future
