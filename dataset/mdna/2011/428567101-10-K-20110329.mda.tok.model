item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview hibbett sports  inc operates sporting goods stores in small to mid sized markets  predominantly in the southeast  southwest  mid atlantic and midwest regions of the united states 
our stores offer a broad assortment of quality footwear  apparel and athletic equipment with a high level of customer service 
as of january   we operated a total of retail stores composed of hibbett sports stores  sports additions athletic shoe stores and sports co 
superstores in states 
our primary retail format and growth vehicle is hibbett sports  a  square foot store located primarily in strip centers which are usually influenced by a wal mart store 
approximately of our hibbett sports store base is located in strip centers  which includes free standing stores  while approximately of our hibbett sports store base is located in enclosed malls 
over the last several years  we have concentrated and expect to continue our store base growth in strip centers versus enclosed malls 
we believe hibbett sports stores are typically the primary sporting goods retailers in their markets due to the extensive selection of quality brand name merchandise and a high level of customer service 
we do not expect that the average size of our stores opening in fiscal will vary significantly from the average size of stores opened in fiscal the volatile global economic conditions experienced in fiscal and fiscal improved somewhat in fiscal and we saw an increase in comparable store and total net sales  while also enhancing net income through continued effective management of expenses 
unlike fiscal  all of our merchandise categories experienced robust comparable store sales 
footwear and equipment experienced mid single digit comparable store sales while apparel  led by activewear and accessories  posted double digit gains 
we historically have increases in comparable store net sales in the low to mid single digit range 
we plan to increase total company wide square footage by over in fiscal  which is at the lower end of our historical range of to  but is an improvement over fiscal and fiscal square footage increases 
to somewhat offset the slower new store openings  we continue to expand high performing stores  increasing the square footage in existing stores in fiscal we expect to expand an additional stores in fiscal total sales percentage growth is expected to be in the low to mid single digits in fiscal over the past several years  we have increased our product margin through improved vendor discounts  fewer retail price reductions and increased efficiencies in logistics 
we expect an improvement in product margin rate in fiscal as we continue to benefit from increased efficiencies from our previous investment in systems 
although the macroeconomic environment has presented many challenges in the last three years  our management believes that our business fundamentals remain strong and that we are well positioned for the future 
we are a leader in the markets in which we compete and we will continue to benefit from our comparatively low operating costs compared to the costs of our competitors 
we continue to manage our costs and inventories prudently as dictated by the current economic environment  and we intend to continue to invest in initiatives to prepare our infrastructure for continued long term growth 
our management expects that the uncertainty and volatility of global economic conditions experienced over the last three years will continue 
any further negative impact on customer discretionary spending could negatively impact our net sales and level of profitability in fiscal due to our increased net sales  we have historically leveraged our store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
based on projected net sales  we expect operating  selling and administrative rates to increase slightly in fiscal  primarily due to investments in technology 
we also expect to continue to generate sufficient cash to enable us to expand and remodel our store base  to provide capital expenditures for both distribution center and technology upgrade projects and to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase authorization 
we utilize a merchandise management system that allows us to identify and monitor trends 
however  this system does not produce us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap financial information by product category 
therefore  it is impracticable to provide us gaap net sales by product category

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the weeks ended january   from million for the weeks ended january  furthermore we opened hibbett sports stores while closing underperforming hibbett sports stores and one sports co 
store for net stores opened of stores in the weeks ended january  we expanded or remodeled high performing stores 
new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
store openings and closings are reported net of relocations 
we experienced a increase in comparable store net sales for the weeks ended january  compared to the weeks ended january  higher comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
during fiscal  stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison 
the increase in comparable store net sales was broad based with strong performances across footwear  equipment  apparel and accessories 
strong product performances were led by positive trends in accessories  licensed apparel  activewear  all categories of footwear and equipment 
strip locations continue to outperform enclosed mall stores 
strip center locations now comprise approximately of our total store base and include free standing store locations 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended january  the increase in gross profit percent was due primarily to a higher percentage of merchandise sold at regular price and fewer promotions 
distribution expense as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points primarily due to basis point decreases in salary and benefit costs compared to a year ago 
store occupancy expense as a percentage of net sales decreased basis points 
the largest decrease was rent expense as a percentage of net sales as we continue to experience rent savings through lease renegotiations and from co tenancy violations by our landlords  offset somewhat by a decrease in construction allowances used to offset rent expense 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended january  expense trends we experienced included salary and benefit costs in our stores decreased by basis points as a percentage of net sales  but increased in dollars  primarily from annual pay rate increases and incentive payments associated with higher sales 
these expenses increased at the administrative level by basis points as a percentage of net sales primarily due to increases in accruals for bonuses 
legal fees  business insurance costs and professional fees were lower as we continue to closely monitor and carefully manage these costs 
credit and debit card fees increased as a percent to net sales due to higher exchange rates 
medical insurance costs increased as a result of increased enrollment coupled with a slight increase in actual claims 
third party freight and shipping costs were also higher  primarily due to an increase in the total number of stores serviced 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   and in the weeks ended january  the average lease term of new store leases added in fiscal compared to those added in fiscal increased to years compared to years  respectively  as the result of the execution of more leases with longer initial lease terms in fiscal compared to fiscal we attribute the decrease in depreciation expense as a percent of net sales to a decrease in the investment in leasehold improvements in recent years as more of the build out work is being done by landlords offset somewhat by changes in estimates of useful lives of leasehold improvements in some underperforming stores 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   compared to for the weeks ended january  this increase was primarily due to operating efficiencies achieved resulting in higher pre tax income as a percentage of net sales 
the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal this decrease was primarily due to increased stock option exercise activity 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the weeks ended january   from million for the weeks ended january  furthermore we opened hibbett sports stores while closing hibbett sports stores for net stores opened of stores in the weeks ended january  nineteen high performing stores were expanded 
new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
store openings and closings are reported net of relocations 
we experienced a increase in comparable store net sales for the weeks ended january  compared to the weeks ended january  higher comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
items per sales transaction improved by in fiscal compared to fiscal during fiscal  stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison 
the slight increase in comparable store net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of items per transaction and improved efficiencies in systems that enhanced our ability to offer the right product in the right store 
we also believe that the close proximity of our stores  coupled with brand name merchandise selection and successful college and professional sports seasons within our markets in the fourth quarter contributed to our increase in comparable store net sales 
with the exception of footwear  we experienced an overall increase in comparable store sales across our merchandise categories 
accessories made the largest comparable stores sales gains in the high teens and twenties while footwear  excluding cleats  declined mid single digits 
we believe the gains in accessory sales is the direct result of concentrated efforts of our operations and marketing teams to increase items per transaction by offering accessories as add ons at the point of sale 
we believe that the decline in footwear sales resulted from the lack of economic stimulus checks that were in the market in fiscal and also from the tougher macroeconomic environment which has affected discretionary spending 
all other categories of merchandise performed within the levels we expected 
strip center locations continue to outperform enclosed mall stores 
strip center locations now comprise approximately of our total store base and include free standing store locations 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  in the week period of the prior fiscal year 
we attribute this increase in gross profit to increased markups  improved vendor contributions and reduced freight costs 
of the store occupancy related costs  rent expense had the greatest increase due to the increase in our store base and fewer construction allowance dollars to offset rent as landlords are delivering more complete stores 
utility expenses and real estate taxes also increased as a percent to net sales 
distribution expense decreases contributed the most to our increase in gross profit percent to net sales 
the most significant decreases were in data processing costs and fuel costs in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as we move towards delivery by third party logistics providers to our outlying stores  increasing the efficiency of the hibbett fleet 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended january  expense trends we experienced included salary and benefit costs in our stores increased by basis points  resulting primarily from increased incentive sales pay and increases in the minimum wage 
administrative salary and benefit costs decreased slightly  although stock based compensation increased basis points as the result of the achievement of performance based awards and a higher stock price at the date of grant as compared to fiscal as a result of fewer store openings in fiscal compared to fiscal  new store costs decreased basis points and store training costs  associated primarily with the training of new store managers  decreased basis points 
credit and debit card fees increased as a percent to net sales due to higher exchange rates 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   and in the weeks ended january  the average lease term of new store leases added in fiscal compared to those added in fiscal decreased to years compared to years  respectively 
we attribute the decrease in depreciation expense as a percent of net sales to the lower number of new stores added in the last three years and a lower investment in leasehold improvements for each new location as landlords are moving toward delivering more occupant ready stores and moving away from construction allowances and tenant completed units 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   compared to for the weeks ended january  the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and fiscal liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to new store openings  stock repurchases and working capital requirements 
our working capital requirements are somewhat seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak near the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through our cash flow from operations and occasionally from borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal year ended january  january  january  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net increase in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
cash flow from operations is seasonal in our business 
typically  we use cash flow from operations to increase inventory in advance of peak selling seasons  such as winter holidays and back to school 
inventory levels are reduced in connection with higher sales during the peak selling seasons and this inventory reduction  combined with proportionately higher net income  typically produces a positive cash flow 
in recent years  we have experienced a trend of increasing free rent provisions in lieu of cash construction allowances in our leases 
we believe this is primarily the result of the tightening of commercial credit on our landlords 
because of this  the non cash portion of landlord allowances has also experienced increases 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the weeks ended january  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million and million in the weeks ended january  and january   respectively 
inventory levels have continued to increase year over year as the number of stores have increased  although the inventory per store has historically trended slightly down to flat 
ending inventory at january  was up compared to january  the increase in inventory used cash of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the accounts payable increase provided cash of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as we took advantage of more favorable payment terms and managed cash while protecting vendor discounts 
net income provided cash of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
non cash charges included depreciation and amortization expense of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and stock based compensation expense of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities in the fiscal periods ended january   january  and january  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
gross capital expenditures used million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we use cash in investing activities to build new stores and remodel or relocate existing stores 
furthermore  net cash used in investing activities includes purchases of information technology assets and expenditures for our distribution facility and corporate headquarters 
we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended january  we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended january  we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended january we estimate the cash outlay for capital expenditures in the fiscal year ending january  will be approximately million  which relates to the opening of approximately new stores  remodeling of selected existing stores  information system upgrades and various improvements at our headquarters and distribution center 
of the total budgeted dollars for capital expenditures for fiscal  we anticipate that approximately will be related to the opening of new stores and remodeling and or relocating existing stores 
approximately will be related to information systems with the remaining related primarily to office expansion  distribution center improvement and security equipment for our stores 
as of january   we had an approximate million outlay remaining on enhancements to our merchandising system relating to inventory planning 
we believe these enhancements will further advance our ability to analyze inventory needs and generally improve sales across all markets and merchandise by providing another tool for managing our inventory at the store level 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in the weeks ended january  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million in the weeks ended january  and net cash used in financing activities of million in the weeks ended january  the financing activity cash fluctuation between years is primarily the result of repurchases of our common stock 
we expended million and million on repurchases of our common stock during fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we did not repurchase any of our common stock during fiscal financing activities also consisted of proceeds from stock option exercises and the excess tax benefit from the exercise of incentive stock options 
as stock options are exercised  we will continue to receive proceeds and expect a tax deduction  however  the amounts and timing cannot be predicted 
at january   we had two unsecured revolving credit facilities that allow borrowings up to million and million  respectively  and which renew in august and november  respectively 
the facilities do not require a commitment or agency fee nor are there any covenant restrictions 
we plan to renew these facilities as they expire and do not anticipate any problems in doing so  however  no assurance can be given that we will be granted a renewal or terms which are acceptable to us 
as of january   we did not have any debt outstanding under either of these facilities 
at january   we had two unsecured revolving credit facilities that allowed borrowings up to million and million  respectively  and which renewed in august and november  respectively 
the facilities did not require a commitment or agency fee nor were there any covenant restrictions 
we renewed these facilities as they expired 
as of january   we did not have any debt outstanding under either of these facilities
