item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our historical consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a holding company with operations being conducted by our subsidiaries 
our specialty property and casualty insurance companies are licensed in all states  the district of columbia and the cayman islands 
we generate underwriting profits by providing what we view as specialized insurance products  services and programs not generally available in the marketplace 
while many companies write property and casualty insurance for transportation companies  we believe that few write passenger transportation coverage nationwide and very few write coverage for several of the classes of passenger transportation insurance written by us and our subsidiaries 
we focus on niche insurance markets where we offer insurance products designed to meet the unique needs of targeted insurance buyers that we believe are underserved by the insurance industry 
these niche markets typically possess what we view as barriers to entry  such as being too small  too remote or too difficult to attract or sustain most competitors 
examples of products that we write for these markets include captive programs for transportation companies that we refer to as our alternative risk transfer art programs of gross premiums written  property and casualty insurance for transportation companies  specialty personal lines  primarily recreational vehicle and commercial vehicle coverage and transportation and general commercial insurance in hawaii and alaska 
effective july   with the acquisition of vanliner insurance company vic  which is described in further detail below  we also now underwrite and sell insurance products for moving and storage transportation companies  which is included in our transportation component 
we strive to become a market leader in the specialty markets that we choose and serve by offering what we believe are specialized products  excellent customer service and superior claims response 
we write commercial insurance for various sizes of transportation fleets 
because of the number of smaller fleets nationwide  we have more opportunities to write smaller risks than larger ones 
when general economic conditions improve  entrepreneurs are encouraged to start new transportation companies  which typically commence operations as a smaller risk and a potential traditional insurance customer for us 
during periods of economic downturn  smaller risks are more prone to failure due to a decrease in leisure travel and consolidation in the industry 
an increase in the number of larger risks results in more prospective art insurance customers 
we generally do not believe that smaller fleets that generate annual premiums of less than  are large enough to retain the risks associated with participation in one of the art programs we currently offer 
by offering insurance products to all sizes of risks  we believe we have hedged against the possibility that there will be a reduction in demand for the products we offer 
we believe that we will continue to have opportunities to grow and profit with both traditional and art customers based on our assumptions regarding future economic and competitive conditions 
we generally incur low start up costs for new businesses  typically less than  incurred over several quarters 
we believe our flexible processes and scalable systems  along with controlled increase of businesses  allow us to manage costs and match them with the revenue flow 
the factors that impact our growth rate are consistent across all products 
however  the trends impacting each of these factors may vary from time to time for individual products 
those factors are as follows submissions the increase or decrease in the number of new applications we receive 
this is influenced by the effectiveness of our marketing activities compared to the marketing activities of our competitors in each market 
the change in the number of current policyholders that are available for a renewal quote 
the number of policyholders available for renewal changes based upon the economic conditions impacting our customer groups and the extent of consolidation that may be taking place within the industries we support 

table of contents quotes the change in the percentage of the new applications received that do not receive a quote from us 
we do not quote risks that do not meet our risk selection criteria or for which we have not been provided complete application data 
we refer to this ratio as the declination ratio and an increasing declination ratio usually results in reduced opportunities to write new business 
sales the change in percentage of the quotes we issue that are actually sold 
we refer to this ratio as the hit ratio 
hit ratios are affected by the number of competitors  the prices quoted by these competitors and the degree of difference between the competitors pricing  terms and conditions and ours 
rates the change in our rate structure from period to period 
the rates we file and quote are impacted by several factors including the cost and extent of the reinsurance we purchase  our operating efficiencies  our average loss costs  which reflect the effectiveness of our underwriting  our underwriting profit expectations  and our claims adjusting processes 
the difference between our rates and the rates of our competitors is the primary factor impacting the revenue growth of our established product lines 
product offerings and distribution we operate in multiple markets with multiple distribution approaches to attempt to reduce the probability that an adverse competitive response in any single market will have a significant impact on our overall business 
we also attempt to maintain several new products  product line extensions or product distribution approaches in active development status so we are able to take advantage of market opportunities 
we select from potential new product ideas based on our stated new business criteria and the anticipated competitive response 
acquisition of vanliner group  inc vanliner effective july   we and our principal insurance subsidiary  national interstate insurance company niic  completed the acquisition of vanliner from unigroup  inc unigroup whereby niic acquired all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of vanliner and we acquired certain information technology assets 
as part of this acquisition  unigroup agreed to provide us with comprehensive financial guarantees  including a four and a half year balance sheet guaranty whereby both favorable and unfavorable balance sheet developments inure to unigroup 
through the acquisition of vanliner  niic acquired vic  a market leader in providing insurance for the moving and storage industry 
obtaining a presence in this industry was our primary strategic objective associated with the acquisition 
vic s moving and storage insurance premiums associated with policies in force totaled approximately million as of december   representing approximately of its total business 
beginning july   the date we completed the acquisition  vanliner s results are included as part of our transportation component  with the exception of vic s moving and storage group captive program  which is a part of our alternative risk transfer component 
additional disclosures regarding the vanliner acquisition are contained in note acquisition of vanliner group  inc industry and trends the property casualty p c insurance industry is cyclical  with periods of rising premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of substantial price competition and excess capacity soft market 
despite experiencing continued soft market conditions during  the p c insurance industry generated a year over year increase in premiums written for the first time since the industry s underwriting results were relatively flat during  as a significant increase in the frequency of low severity catastrophe related losses was offset by significant favorable development on prior year loss reserves according to available industry data compiled by am best through the first nine months of the industry faces several unfavorable trends in the coming year such as  but not limited to  prolonged recession driven pricing instability  diminishing savings from prior year reserve development and the continuance of relatively low investment returns 

table of contents despite relatively flat pricing since  improved risk selection and an overall improvement in the risk quality of our book of business have enabled us to attain combined ratios better than our corporate objective of or lower 
since our inception in we have placed a consistent emphasis on underwriting profit 
though our combined ratio may fluctuate from year to year  over the past five years we have exceeded our underwriting profit objective by achieving an average gaap combined ratio of 
we believe the following factors contribute to our performance  which is consistently above industry standards our business model and bottom line orientation have resulted in disciplined and consistent risk assessment and pricing adequacy 
our ability to attract and retain some of the best transportation companies in the industries we serve and to insure them directly or through our captive programs 
our stable operating expenses which have historically been at or below the revenue growth rate 
during  interest rates remained low  which increased the value of many of our fixed income holdings 
as such  we sold securities  primarily to generate funds for the vanliner acquisition  which resulted in realized gains from investments 
we have historically maintained a high quality investment portfolio  focusing primarily on investment grade fixed income investments 
during  we sold securities  primarily u 
s government and government agency obligations  to generate funds to finance the acquisition of vanliner 
subsequent to the acquisition  we experienced a shift in the mix of our fixed maturities portfolio due to reinvesting vanliner s acquired cash balances in corporate obligations  as these securities generally offered the mix of yield and duration that best met our business needs 
although we cannot provide any assurances  at december   with over of our investment portfolio comprised of investment grade fixed income  investment grade preferred stock and cash and cash equivalents  we believe we remain properly positioned as we head into as noted above  the p c insurance industry saw a significant upswing in the frequency of low severity catastrophe related losses in  including tornadoes  winter storms  hail and floods  while experiencing a relatively quiet hurricane season 
for weather related events such as hurricanes  tornados and hailstorms  we conduct an analysis at least annually pursuant to which we input our in force exposures vehicle values in all states and property limits in hawaii into an independent catastrophe model that predicts our probable maximum loss at various statistical confidence levels 
our estimated probable maximum loss is impacted by changes in our in force exposures as well as changes to the assumptions inherent in the catastrophe model 
hurricane and other weather related events have not had a material negative impact on our past results 
our transportation insurance business in particular  including vanliner s moving and storage insurance product  is also affected by cost trends that negatively impact profitability such as inflation in vehicle repair costs  vehicle replacement parts costs  used vehicle prices  fuel costs and medical care costs 
we routinely obtain independent data for vehicle repair inflation  vehicle replacement parts costs  used vehicle prices  fuel costs and medical care costs and adjust our pricing routines to attempt to more accurately project the future costs associated with insurance claims 
historically  these increased costs have not had a material adverse impact on our results 
of course  we would expect a negative impact on our future results if we fail to properly account for and project for these inflationary trends 
increased litigation of claims may also negatively impact our profitability 
as described below  the average revenue dollar per personal lines policy is significantly lower than typical commercial policies 
profitability in the specialty personal lines component is dependent on proper pricing and the efficiency of underwriting and policy administration 
we have continued to monitor rate levels and have adjusted them during  as warranted 
we continuously strive to improve our underwriting and policy issuance functions to keep this cost element as low as possible by utilizing current technology advances 
to succeed as a transportation underwriter and personal lines underwriter  we must understand and be able to quantify the different risk characteristics of the risks we consider quoting 
certain coverages are more stable and predictable than others and we must recognize the various components of the risks we assume when we write any specific class of insurance business 
examples of trends that can change and  therefore  impact our profitability are loss frequency  loss severity  geographic loss cost differentials  societal and legal factors impacting loss costs such as tort reform  punitive damage inflation and increasing jury awards and changes in regulation impacting the insurance relationship 
any changes in these factors that are not recognized and priced for accordingly will affect 
table of contents our future profitability 
we believe our product management organization provides the focus on a specific risk class needed to stay current with the trends affecting each specific class of business we write 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from premiums from our insurance policies and income from our investment portfolio 
our underwriting approach is to price our products to achieve an underwriting profit even if it requires us to forego volume 
as with all p c insurance companies  the impact of price changes is reflected in our financial results over time 
price changes on our in force policies occur as they are renewed  which generally takes twelve months for our entire book of business and up to an additional twelve months to earn a full year of premium at the renewal rate 
insurance rates charged on renewing policies decreased slightly in compared to there are distinct differences in the timing of premiums written in traditional transportation insurance compared to the majority of our art insurance component 
we write traditional transportation insurance policies throughout all twelve months of the year and commence new annual policies at the expiration of the old policy 
under most art programs  all members of the group share a common renewal date 
these common renewal dates are scheduled throughout the calendar year 
any new art program participant that joins after the common date will be written for other than a full annual term so its next renewal date coincides with the common expiration date of the program it has joined 
historically  most of our group programs had common renewal dates in the first six months of the year  but with the growth from new art programs  we are now experiencing renewal dates throughout the calendar year 
the art component of our business accounted for of total gross premiums written during as compared to in the projected profitability from traditional transportation accounts and transportation captive businesses are substantially comparable 
increased investment income opportunities generally are available with traditional insurance  but the lower acquisition expenses and persistence of the captive programs generally provide for lower operating expenses from these programs 
the lower expenses associated with our captives generally offset the projected reductions in investment income potential 
from a projected profitability perspective  we are ambivalent as to whether a transportation operator elects to purchase traditional insurance or one of our art program options 
all of our transportation products  traditional or art  are priced to achieve targeted underwriting margins 
because traditional insurance tends to have a higher operating expense structure  the portion of the premiums available to pay losses tends to be lower for a traditional insurance quote versus an art insurance quote 
we use a cost plus pricing approach that projects future losses based upon the insured s historic losses and other factors 
operating expenses  premium taxes and a profit margin are then added to the projected loss component to achieve the total premium to be quoted 
the lower the projected losses  expenses and taxes  the lower the total quoted premiums regardless of whether it is a traditional or art program quotation 
quoted premiums are computed in accordance with our approved insurance department filings in each state 
our specialty personal lines products are also priced to achieve targeted underwriting margins 
the average premium per policy for this business component is significantly less than transportation lines 
we approach investment and capital management with the intention of supporting insurance operations by providing a stable source of income to supplement underwriting income 
the goals of our investment policy are to protect capital while optimizing investment income and capital appreciation and maintaining appropriate liquidity 
we follow a formal investment policy and the board reviews the portfolio performance at least quarterly for compliance with the established guidelines 
in  income from new investments was lower due to the continued low interest rate environment  but the value of many of our existing holdings increased 
as a result  we recorded a million pre tax net realized gain on investments in  which includes gains from securities sold to generate funds for the vanliner acquisition  as compared to the million pre tax net realized gain recorded in expenses losses and loss adjustment expenses lae are a function of the amount and type of insurance contracts we write and of the loss experience of the underlying risks 
we record losses and lae based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses we expect to be reported on contracts written 
we seek to establish case reserves at the maximum 
table of contents probable exposure based on our historical claims experience 
our ability to estimate losses and lae accurately at the time of pricing our contracts is a critical factor in determining our profitability 
vanliner s losses and lae are recorded based on the same manner of actuarial analysis and claims reserving practices as our preexisting legacy operations 
the amount reported under losses and lae in any period includes payments in the period net of the change in the value of the reserves for unpaid losses and lae between the beginning and the end of the period 
commissions and other underwriting expenses consist principally of brokerage and agent commissions and to a lesser extent premium taxes 
the brokerage and agent commissions are reduced by ceding commissions received from assuming reinsurers that represent a percentage of the premiums on insurance policies and reinsurance contracts written and vary depending upon the amount and types of contracts written 
the cost structure of vanliner s commissions and other underwriting expenses is comparable to the cost structure of our legacy operations and has not materially affected our underwriting profitability 
other operating and general expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses including salaries  benefits and certain costs associated with awards under our equity compensation plans  such as stock compensation expense and other general operating expenses 
our personnel expenses are primarily fixed in nature and do not vary with the amount of premiums written 
during  we significantly increased our employee headcount in conjunction with the vanliner acquisition 
the personnel expenses attributable to vanliner are in line with our legacy operations relative to the premium base they support and have not materially affected our operating results 
interest expenses associated with outstanding debt and expense on amounts withheld are disclosed separately from operating and general expenses 
we invest funds in the participant loss layer for several of our art programs 
we receive investment income and incur an equal expense on the amounts owed to art participants 
expense on amounts withheld represents investment income that we remit back to art participants 
the related investment income is included in the net investment income line on our consolidated statements of income 
results of operations overview the following table sets forth our  and net income from operations  after tax net realized gains losses from investments  change in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to net capital losses and the after tax impact from vanliner s guaranteed runoff business  all of which are non gaap financial measures that we believe are useful tools for investors and analysts in analyzing ongoing operating trends  as well as the gain on bargain purchase of vanliner and net income 
year ended december  amount per share amount per share amount per share dollars in thousands  except per share data net income from operations after tax net realized gains losses from investments change in valuation allowance related to net capital losses gain on bargain purchase of vanliner after tax impact from balance sheet guaranty for vanliner net income our net earnings from operations for were million per share diluted compared to million per share diluted in the decline was primarily driven by an elevated loss and lae ratio from ongoing operations of  which excludes the impact from the runoff of the guaranteed vanliner business  as compared to in while these claims results were profitable for us  they are several percentage points higher than our historical ratios and management s expectations 
the year over year increase from to was due to a combination of the favorable claims results experienced throughout  higher 
table of contents claim frequency in our commercial vehicle product in  which is part of the specialty personal lines component  and the impact from several periods of single digit rate decreases in our transportation component 
we also experienced higher than expected claims severity among certain of our trucking products both in our alternative risk transfer and transportation components during our underwriting expense ratio attributable to ongoing operations remained relatively flat at for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  during  income tax expense was positively impacted by a reduction of million per share diluted in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets related to net realized losses on investments  primarily impairment charges 
a valuation allowance reduction of million per share diluted was recorded for the year ended december  all reductions to the deferred tax valuation allowance were due to both available tax strategies and the future realizability of previously impaired securities 
subsequent to march   we no longer have a valuation allowance against any deferred tax assets 
in conjunction with the completion of the vanliner acquisition  we recorded a gain on bargain purchase of million per share diluted as of the july  acquisition date 
the purchase price of the acquisition was based on vanliner s tangible book value 
the fair value of the net assets acquired of million was in excess of the total purchase consideration of million  primarily due to the recognition of certain intangible assets under purchase accounting  an adjustment to record the acquired loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserves at fair value  as well as recording management s best estimate of the contingent consideration due from the seller associated with the balance sheet guaranty 
a gain on bargain purchase is a nontaxable transaction and therefore has not been tax effected in the table above or in our consolidated statements of income 
as previously disclosed  the seller provided us with comprehensive financial guarantees related to the runoff of vanliner s final balance sheet whereby both favorable and unfavorable balance sheet development inures to the seller 
additionally  as a result of purchase accounting requirements to determine the fair value of the future economic benefit of the financial guarantees and acquired loss reserves  we have recorded our estimate of future development which impacts the gain on bargain purchase  despite the fact that certain gains and losses related to the financial guaranty will be reflected in operations as they are incurred in future periods 
as a result  the recognition of the revenues and expenses associated with the guaranteed runoff business will not occur in the same period and will result in combined ratios which are not consistent with the negotiated combined ratio which was to approximate for the vanliner guaranteed business 
as such  the after tax impact from the runoff business guaranteed by the seller of million for has been removed from the net after tax earnings from operations to reflect only those results of the ongoing business 
gross premiums written we operate our business as one segment  property and casualty insurance 
we manage this segment through a product management structure 
the following table sets forth an analysis of gross premiums written by business component during the periods indicated year ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands alternative risk transfer transportation specialty personal lines hawaii and alaska other gross premiums written gross premiums written includes both direct premium and assumed premium 
during  our gross premiums written increased million  or  compared to included in this increase is million of gross premiums written related to vanliner  which are included in the transportation component 
excluding 
table of contents vanliner s gross premiums written  the remaining million increase is primarily attributable to our alternative risk transfer component  which grew million  or  over primarily due to the addition of six new customers to our large account captive product and growth in existing programs 
we also started our first group art program for vanliner s moving and storage business in the fourth quarter of this growth was partially offset by management s decision to reduce lines of coverage written in one of our other art programs beginning in the second quarter of exclusive of the vanliner related premiums  the transportation component increased million  or  which is primarily attributable to our continued focus on marketing efforts  including the appointment of additional production sources 
these actions lead to increased business submissions and therefore premium growth 
we have placed additional emphasis on seeking out and quoting preferred truck and passenger transportation accounts  all the while continuing to emphasize and maintain our disciplined underwriting approach 
gross premiums written for both our specialty personal lines and hawaii and alaska components were relatively flat in compared to the growth in our specialty personal lines component slowed during reflecting the underwriting and pricing actions related to the commercial vehicle product that were initiated during the fourth quarter of  while the hawaii and alaska component continued to be impacted by competitive market conditions 
our group art programs  which focus on specialty or niche businesses  provide various services and coverages tailored to meet specific requirements of defined client groups and their members 
these services include risk management consulting  claims administration and handling  loss control and prevention and reinsurance placement  along with providing various types of property and casualty insurance coverage 
insurance coverage is provided primarily to companies with similar risk profiles and to specified classes of business of our agent partners 
as part of our art programs  we have analyzed  on a quarterly basis  members loss performance on a policy year basis to determine if there would be a premium assessment to participants or if there would be a return of premium to participants as a result of less than expected losses 
assessment premium and return of premium are recorded as adjustments to written premium assessments increase written premium  returns of premium reduce written premium 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded return of premium of million  million and million  respectively

excluding vanliner s premiums earned  the remaining million increase is primarily attributable to the alternative risk transfer component which grew million  or  over mainly due to the new art programs introduced throughout and our specialty personal lines component increased million  or  resulting from the growth in our commercial vehicle product experienced in these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in the hawaii and alaska component resulting from reductions in gross premiums written in

our alternative risk transfer component increased in compared to  mainly due to new art programs introduced throughout our specialty personal lines component increased during compared to the same period in  due to continued gross premiums written growth in our commercial vehicle product 
underwriting and loss ratio analysis underwriting profitability  as opposed to overall profitability or net earnings  is measured by the combined ratio 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and lae ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
a combined ratio under is indicative of an underwriting profit 
our underwriting approach is to price our products to achieve an underwriting profit even if we forego volume as a result 
from through  our insurance subsidiaries increased their premium rates to offset rising losses and reinsurance costs 
beginning in and continuing throughout  we have experienced a slight decline in rate levels on renewal business due to the continued softening market

compared to losses and lae increased million  or  for compared to the consolidated loss and lae ratio for the year ended december  increased percentage points to compared to in the same period in  which is several percentage points higher than our historical annual ratio 
the loss and lae ratio for our ongoing operations  which excludes the impact from the runoff of the guaranteed vanliner business  was for the year ended december  this elevated loss and lae ratio is primarily due to favorable claims results experienced throughout  higher losses experienced in by our commercial vehicle product  which is part of the specialty personal lines component  and the impact from several periods of single digit rate decreases in our transportation component 
additionally  we experienced higher than expected claims severity among certain of our trucking products in both our alternative risk transfer and transportation components during for the year ended december   we had favorable development from prior years loss reserves of million  or percentage points  compared to favorable development of million  or percentage points  for the same period in this favorable development was primarily related to settlements below the established case reserves and revisions to our estimated future settlements on an individual case by case basis 
the prior years loss reserve development for both periods is not considered to be unusual or significant to prior years reserves based on the history of our business and the timing of events in the claims adjustment process 
commissions and other underwriting expenses consist principally of brokerage and agent commissions reduced by ceding commissions received from assuming reinsurers  and vary depending upon the amount and types of contracts written and  to a lesser extent  premium taxes 
the consolidated underwriting expense ratio for the year ended december  decreased percentage points to compared to for the same period in  primarily attributable to our mix of business written during compared to losses and lae decreased million  or  for compared to the loss and lae ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the loss and lae ratio in of percentage points was primarily due to the greater loss severity experienced in during the first three quarters of  we experienced an unusual number of severe claims  primarily concentrated in our charter passenger transportation products 
these claims contributed approximately percentage points to the loss and lae ratio during  whereas we experienced significantly lower large claim activity throughout  which reduced our loss and lae ratio by percentage points 
the large claims levels experienced during are not considered to be unusual 
we attribute the improvement in to the review of our underwriting standards that we began in the third quarter of and continued into  as well as other risk selection and pricing adequacy initiatives and lower vehicle usage by our 
table of contents customers in partially offsetting the decrease in severity was an increase in claim frequency related to higher vehicle usage particularly within our specialty personal lines component  primarily commercial vehicle  during for the years ended december  and  we had favorable development from prior years loss reserves of million and million  respectively 
the favorable development for both years was primarily related to settlements below the established case reserves and revisions to our estimated future settlements on an individual case by case basis 
this development represents only and for and  respectively  of the prior year reserves 
commissions and other underwriting expenses consist principally of brokerage and agent commissions reduced by ceding commissions received from assuming reinsurers  and vary depending upon the amount and types of contracts written and  to a lesser extent  premium taxes 
the underwriting expense ratio was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the percentage point decrease to our expense ratio was primarily due to a change in our overall mix of business  as many of the new captive programs written in have lower commission rates compared to the programs where we had high premium growth in net investment income compared to net investment income increased million  or  to million in compared to  primarily due to million of net investment income earned from vanliner s portfolio 
after removing the impact of vanliner  net investment income was relatively flat compared to due to the continued effect of the low interest rate environment that was present throughout and  as well as lost investment income from the use of funds to acquire vanliner 
cash flows  including those from higher yielding investments that matured  as well as cash held by vanliner at the date of acquisition  were reinvested in similar  but often lower yielding securities that were available in the market 
compared to net investment income decreased million  or  to million in compared to  reflecting lower yields on our cash  short term and fixed income portfolios due to a prolonged low interest rate environment and a focus on high quality investments during the financial crisis  as well as a high allocation to tax exempt state and local government investments 
the decrease in yields  which we initially experienced in  continued in and remained at lower levels  offsetting the portfolio growth that occurred during the year 
net realized gains losses on investments compared to in  we had pre tax net realized gains of million compared to million for the pre tax net realized gains for the year ended december  were primarily generated from net realized gains from the sales of securities of million  which include sales to generate funds for the vanliner acquisition  and gains associated with an equity partnership investment of million 
offsetting these gains were credit loss other than temporary impairment charges of million  as well as losses associated with an equity partnership investment of million 
the pre tax net realized gains for the year ended december  were primarily generated from net realized gains associated with an equity partnership investment of million and realized gains associated with the sales of securities of million 
offsetting these gains were other than temporary impairment charges recognized in earnings of million and realized losses of million on disposals  including a million realized loss on the conversion of a perpetual preferred stock to common stock on a financial institution holding 
the two largest components of the million impairment charge were million on three corporate notes and credit only impairments of million related to four mortgage backed securities 
compared to in  we had pre tax net realized gains of million compared to pre tax net realized losses of million for realized gains of million for the year ended december  were partially offset by other than temporary impairment charges recognized in earnings of million and realized losses of million on disposals 
in  turmoil in the investment markets resulted in market declines in our portfolio  particularly in our financial and real estate related holdings 
this had an adverse impact on our investment portfolio in  as we recognized other than temporary impairment charges on investments of million for the year ended december  
table of contents gain on bargain purchase in conjunction with the vanliner acquisition  we recorded a gain on bargain purchase of million during the year ended december  the fair value of the net assets acquired of million was in excess of the total purchase consideration of million  due to the recognition of certain intangible assets under purchase accounting  an adjustment to record the acquired loss and allocated loss adjustment expense reserves at fair value  as well as recording management s best estimate of the contingent consideration due from the seller associated with the balance sheet guaranty 
other income compared to other income increased million  or  to million for compared to million in this increase is primarily attributable to the continued growth in the policy based fee income generated by our personal lines component throughout compared to other income increased million  or  to million for compared to million in this increase is primarily attributable to growth in the policy based fee income generated by our personal lines component throughout commissions and other underwriting expenses compared to commissions and other underwriting expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in the comparable period in the increase is primarily a result of the growth in gross premiums written  along with our mix of business written during compared to compared to commissions and other underwriting expenses for the year ended december  decreased million  or  to million from million in the comparable period in the decrease relates to a decline in net commission expense due to a change in our overall mix of business 
our various products have different commission rates  therefore  commission expense can vary based on the product mix written during the period 
additionally  our commissions and other underwriting expenses included an approximate million charge for a one time state guaranty fund 
other operating and general expenses compared to other operating and general expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in this increase was primarily due to additional expenses associated with the growth in employee headcount  professional fees and other costs incurred primarily as a result of the vanliner acquisition 
compared to other operating and general expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in these increases were primarily due to an increase in our employee wages over the prior year 
expense on amounts withheld compared to we invest funds in the participant loss layer for several of the alternative risk transfer programs 
we receive investment income and incur an equal expense on the amounts owed to alternative risk transfer participants 
expense on amounts withheld represents investment income that we remit back to alternative risk transfer participants 
the related investment income is included in our net investment income line on our consolidated statements of income 
for the year ended december   the expense on amounts withheld was relatively flat  decreasing million compared to the same period in compared to for the year ended december   the expense on amounts withheld decreased million over the same period in the decrease was primarily attributable to lower interest rate yields experienced during compared to 
table of contents income taxes compared to the effective tax rate was  increasing from a rate of in our income tax expense was favorably impacted by the million gain on bargain purchase of vanliner  which is not subject to income taxation 
in both and  we recorded reductions to our valuation allowance related to net realized losses due to both available tax strategies and the future realizability of previously impaired securities 
no valuation allowance against deferred tax assets existed subsequent to march  excluding these items  our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and were and  respectively 
compared to the effective tax rate was  decreasing from a rate of in the decrease in our effective tax rate was favorably impacted by a decrease in our valuation allowance related to net realized losses 
in  the provision for income taxes was negatively impacted by the recording of a million valuation allowance related to our realized losses  primarily impairment charges  which increased the effective tax rate by percentage points 
in  income tax expense was positively impacted by a million reduction in the deferred tax valuation allowance due to both available tax strategies and the future realizability of previously impaired securities  thereby decreasing our effective tax rate by percentage points 
financial condition investments at december   our investment portfolio contained million in fixed maturity securities and million in equity securities  all carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity on an after tax basis 
at december   we had pretax net unrealized gains of million on fixed maturities and million on equity securities 
our investment portfolio allocation is based on diversification among primarily high quality fixed maturity investments and guidelines in our investment policy 
fixed maturity investments are focused on securities with intermediate term maturities 
at december   the weighted average maturity of our fixed maturity investments was approximately years 
at december   of the fixed maturities in our portfolio were rated investment grade credit rating of aaa to bbb by nationally recognized rating agencies 
investment grade securities generally bear lower degrees of risk and corresponding lower yields than those that are unrated or non investment grade 
although we cannot provide any assurances  we believe that  in normal market conditions  our high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return 
included in the fixed maturities at december  were million of residential mortgage backed securities mbs 
we do not have a significant exposure to the subprime lending sector as of our residential mbs are backed by us government agencies 
mbs are subject to prepayment risk due to the fact that  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be prepaid more rapidly than scheduled as buyers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of declining interest rates

the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
factors considered and resources used by management include those discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other than temporary impairment 

table of contents net realized gains losses on securities sold and charges for other than temporary impairment on securities held were as follows net realized net realized gains losses charges for gains losses on sales impairment on investments dollars in thousands year ended fair value measurements we must determine the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for each applicable measurement 
the fair value hierarchy prioritizes the inputs  which refer broadly to assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  into three levels 
it gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
fair values for our investment portfolio are reviewed by company personnel using data from nationally recognized pricing services as well as non binding broker quotes on a limited basis 
pricing services use a variety of observable inputs to estimate the fair value of fixed maturities that do not trade on a daily basis 
these inputs include  but are not limited to  recent reported trades  benchmark yields  issuer spreads  bids or offers  reference data and measures of volatility 
included in the pricing of mortgage backed securities are estimates of the rate of future prepayments and defaults of principal over the remaining life of the underlying collateral 
inputs from brokers and independent financial institutions include  but are not limited to  yields or spreads of comparable investments which have recent trading activity  credit quality  duration  credit enhancements  collateral value and estimated cash flows based on inputs including  delinquency rates  estimated defaults and losses  and estimates of the rate of future prepayments 
valuation techniques utilized by pricing services and values obtained from brokers and independent financial institutions are reviewed by company personnel who are familiar with the securities being priced and the markets in which they trade to ensure that the fair value determination is representative of an exit price  as defined by accounting standards 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical securities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices within level that are observable for the security  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar securities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar securities that are not active and observable inputs other than quoted prices  such as interest rate and yield curves 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
level consists of publicly traded equity securities whose fair value is based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market 
level primarily consists of financial instruments whose fair value is based on quoted prices in markets that are not active and include us government and government agency securities  fixed maturity investments  perpetual preferred stock and certain publicly traded common stocks and other equity securities that are not actively traded 
included in level are million of securities  which are valued based upon a non binding broker quote and validated with other observable market data by management 
level consists of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market  whose fair value is estimated by management based on inputs from independent financial institutions  including non binding broker quotes  which we believe reflect fair value  but are unable to verify inputs to the valuation methodology 
we obtained one quote or price per instrument from brokers and pricing services for all level securities and did not adjust any quotes or prices obtained 
management reviews these broker quotes using any recent trades  if such information is available  or market prices of similar investments 
we primarily use the market approach valuation technique for all investments 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources capital ratios 
the national association of insurance commissioners model law for risk based capital rbc provides formulas to determine the amount of capital and surplus that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
at december  and  the capital and surplus of all our insurance companies substantially exceeded the rbc requirements 
sources of funds 
the liquidity requirements of our insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and payments of dividends and taxes to us from insurance subsidiaries 
historically  cash flows from premiums and investment income have provided sufficient funds to meet these requirements  without requiring significant liquidation of investments 
if our cash flows change dramatically from historical patterns  for example as a result of a decrease in premiums  an increase in claims paid or operating expenses  or financing an acquisition  we may be required to sell securities before their maturity and possibly at a loss 
our insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid  short term investments or cash and cash equivalents to meet their liquidity needs 
our historic pattern of using receipts from current premium writings for the payment of liabilities incurred in prior periods provides us with the option to extend the maturities of our investment portfolio beyond the estimated settlement date of our loss reserves 
funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities 
we believe that our insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and operating expenses  as well as meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies  inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies 
our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and fixed income securities that are scheduled to mature or expected to be called 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   a million increase from december  for  and  we generated consolidated cash flow from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase of million in cash flow from operations in from is attributable to various fluctuations within our operating activities associated with our growth 
cash flow from operations decreased million in from primarily due to a large amount of claims payments made during net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this million increase in cash used in investing activities in  as compared to  was primarily related to the million paid on july  to purchase vanliner  net of million of cash and cash equivalents acquired 
in order to generate funds to finance the acquisition  we positioned our portfolio to capitalize on maturities and redemptions of investments  as well as increased our sales of fixed maturity securities 
these actions resulted in additional proceeds from maturities and redemptions of investments and sales of fixed maturity securities of million and million  respectively  over the same period in additionally  we increased our purchases of fixed maturity securities by million over the comparable period in  as we reinvested vanliner s excess cash balances and the proceeds from maturities and redemptions of investments which occurred during the period 
the million decrease in cash used in investing activities in compared to was primarily related to a million increase in the proceeds from the sale of fixed maturity securities and an million decrease in the purchase of fixed maturity investments in  which were offset by a million decrease in the proceeds from maturities and redemptions of investments 
the decrease in both purchases and redemptions of fixed maturity investments in  compared to the prior period was primarily due to a shift in asset allocation from callable us government agency bonds into longer duration state and local government bonds  residential collateralized mortgage backed securities and corporate obligations 
the increase in proceeds from the sale of fixed maturity securities was the result of taking advantage of improving market conditions in to realize gains on portions of our fixed maturity portfolio 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the million decrease in net cash used in financing activities in  as compared to  was primarily driven by the termination of our securities lending program in additionally  we increased our net borrowings under our credit facility by million during primarily to help fund the purchase of the million in information technology assets acquired from unigroup in conjunction 
table of contents with the vanliner acquisition 
the increase in cash used from financing activities in from of million is primarily attributable to the aforementioned termination of our securities lending program in effective july   we and niic completed the acquisition of vanliner 
the initial purchase price of million represented vanliner s estimated tangible book value at closing of million  as well as million for the information technology assets 
this estimated purchase price was to be adjusted based on vanliner s closing balance sheet delivered to us on august   which resulted in a million decrease in tangible book value 
the purchase agreement provided us with an additional day review period following the delivery of vanliner s closing balance sheet 
as a result of certain items identified during the review period  we provided a notice of disagreement to unigroup on october  regarding the closing balance sheet  the net effect of which further reduced tangible book value by an additional million to million 
as a means of resolving the notice of disagreement  niic and unigroup agreed to jointly make an election under section h of the internal revenue code the h election which converts the stock acquisition into an asset acquisition for tax purposes 
through this arrangement  unigroup agreed to compensate us million for vanliner s net deferred tax assets forfeited as a result of making the h election 
in conjunction with executing the h election  niic and unigroup agreed upon vanliner s final tangible book value of million  which will serve as the basis for the future settlements of the financial guarantees 
in february  niic received million from unigroup for the amounts due under the purchase agreement for the h election and the finalization of the tangible book value 
we financed this acquisition with cash  a portion of which was generated through the sale of portfolio securities and  to a lesser extent  with our credit facility 
such sales of portfolio securities did not result in significant realized losses on disposal 
in addition to the cash needs related to this acquisition  we will have continuing cash needs for administrative expenses  the payment of principal and interest on borrowings  shareholder dividends and taxes 
funds to meet these obligations will come primarily from parent company cash  dividends and other payments from our insurance company subsidiaries and from our remaining line of credit 
under the state insurance laws  dividends and capital distributions from our insurance companies are subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus and earnings 
the maximum amount of dividends that our insurance companies could pay to us without seeking regulatory approval in is million 
our insurance subsidiaries paid no dividends in or under tax allocation and cost sharing agreements among the company and its subsidiaries  taxes and expenses are allocated among the entities 
the federal income tax provision of our individual subsidiaries is computed as if the subsidiary filed a separate tax return 
the resulting provision or credit is currently payable to or receivable from us 
we have a million unsecured credit agreement the credit agreement that terminates in december  which includes a sublimit of million for letters of credit 
we have the ability to increase the line of credit to million subject to the credit agreement s accordion feature 
at december  there was million drawn on this credit facility 
amounts borrowed bear interest at either a rate per annum equal to the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate or in excess of the federal funds effective rate or rates ranging from to over libor based on our am best insurance group rating  or at december  as of december   the interest rate on this debt is equal to the six month libor at december  plus basis points  with interest payments due quarterly 
the credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial covenants measured on a quarterly basis  including consolidated net worth  fixed charge coverage ratio and debt to capital ratio 
in addition  the credit agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants  including negative covenants that limit or restrict our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  effect mergers or consolidations  make investments  enter into asset sales  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates and other restrictions customarily contained in such agreements 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants 
we believe that funds generated from operations  including dividends from insurance subsidiaries  parent company cash and funds available under our credit agreement will provide sufficient resources to meet our liquidity requirements  inclusive of the cash required to operate vanliner  for at least the next months 
however  if these funds are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period  we would be required to generate cash through additional borrowings  sale of assets  sale of portfolio securities or similar transactions 
if we were required to sell 
table of contents portfolio securities early for liquidity purposes rather than holding them to maturity  we would recognize gains or losses on those securities earlier than anticipated 
if we were forced to borrow additional funds under our credit agreement in order to meet liquidity needs  we would incur additional interest expense  which could have a negative impact on our earnings 
since our ability to meet our obligations in the long term beyond a month period is dependent upon factors such as market changes  insurance regulatory changes and economic conditions  no assurance can be given that the available net cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating needs 
we are not aware of any trends or uncertainties affecting our liquidity  including any significant future reliance on short term financing arrangements 
off balance sheet items 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in applicable sec rules 
we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities of financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period within more than total year years years years dollars in thousands gross unpaid losses and lae a long term debt obligations additional future consideration payable to unigroup operating lease obligations total a dollar amounts and time periods are estimates based on historical net payment patterns applied to the gross reserves and do not represent actual contractual obligations 
actual payments and their timing could differ significantly from these estimates  and the estimates provided do not reflect potential recoveries under reinsurance treaties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change and impact amounts reported in the future 
management believes that the establishment of loss and lae reserves and the determination of other than temporary impairment on investments are two areas where by the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
we discuss these two policies below 
our other significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
loss and loss adjustment expenses reserves significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of that loss to us and our final payment of that loss and its related lae 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of gross loss and lae reserves  representing management s best estimate of the ultimate loss 
included in the gross loss and lae reserve liabilities at december  is million relating to vanliner 
management records  on a monthly and quarterly basis  its best estimate of loss reserves 
for purposes of computing the recorded reserves  management utilizes various data inputs  including analysis that is derived from a review of prior quarter results performed by actuaries employed by great american 
in addition  on an annual basis  
table of contents actuaries from great american review the recorded reserves for niic  niic hi and tcc utilizing current period data and provide a statement of actuarial opinion  required annually in accordance with state insurance regulations  on the statutory reserves recorded by these us insurance subsidiaries 
for the year ended december   this annual actuarial review process is also inclusive of the recorded reserves for vic 
the actuarial analysis of niic s  vic s  niic hi s and tcc s net reserves as of december  and the actuarial analysis of niic s  niic hi s and tcc s net reserves as of december  reflected point estimates that were within of management s recorded net reserves as of such dates 
using this actuarial data along with its other data inputs  management concluded that the recorded reserves appropriately reflect management s best estimates of the liability as of each year end 
the quarterly reviews of unpaid loss and lae reserves by great american actuaries are prepared using standard actuarial techniques 
these may include but may not be limited to the case incurred development method  the paid development method  the bornhuetter ferguson method  and the incremental paid lae to paid loss methods 
the period of time from the occurrence of a loss through the settlement of the liability is referred to as the tail 
generally  the same actuarial methods are considered for both short tail and long tail lines of business because most of them work properly for both 
the methods are designed to incorporate the effects of the differing length of time to settle particular claims 
for short tail lines  management tends to give more weight to the case incurred and paid development methods  although the various methods tend to produce similar results 
for long tail lines  more judgment is involved and more weight may be given to the bornhuetter ferguson method 
liability claims for long tail lines are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretation and the legal environment 
therefore  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is more complex and subject to a higher degree of variability 
supplementary statistical information is reviewed to determine which methods are most appropriate and whether adjustments are needed to particular methods 
this information includes open and closed claim counts  average case reserves and average incurred on open claims  closure rates and statistics related to closed and open claim percentages  average closed claim severity  ultimate claim severity  reported loss ratios  projected ultimate loss ratios  and loss payment patterns 
following is a discussion of certain critical variables affecting the estimation of loss reserves in our more significant lines of business 
many other variables may also impact ultimate claim costs 
an important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future 
an unexpected change in cost trends could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation  inflation from social programs  new medical technologies or other factors such as those listed below in connection with our largest lines of business 
it is not possible to isolate and measure the potential impact of just one of these variables and future cost trends could be partially impacted by several such variables 
however  it is reasonable to address the sensitivity of the reserves to a potential impact from changes in these variables by measuring the effect of a possible overall change in future cost trends that may be caused by one or more variables 
the sensitivity of recorded reserves to a potential change of in the future cost trends is shown below 
utilizing the effect of a change in overall cost trends enables changes greater than to be estimated by 
table of contents extrapolation 
the estimated cumulative unfavorable impact that this change would have on our net income is shown below cumulative line of business impact commercial auto liability million workers compensation million the judgments and uncertainties surrounding management s reserve estimation process and the potential for reasonably possible variability in management s most recent reserve estimates may also be viewed by looking at how recent historical estimates of reserves for all lines of business have developed 
if our december   reserves net of reinsurance developed at the same rate as the average development of the most recent five years  the effect on net earnings would be an increase of million 
yr 
average net reserves effect on net development december  earnings million million net of tax effect 
the following discussion describes key assumptions and important variables that materially affect the estimate of the reserve for loss and lae of our two most significant lines of business  which represent of our total reserves and explains what caused them to change from assumptions used in the preceding period 
management has not made changes in key assumptions used in calculating current year reserves based on historical changes or current trends observed 
commercial auto liability 
in this line of business  we provide coverage protecting buses  limousines  other public transportation vehicles and trucks for accidents causing property damage or personal injury to others 
property damage liability and medical payments exposures are typically short tail lines of business with relatively quick reporting and settlement of claims 
bodily injury exposure is long tail because although the claim reporting of this line of business is relatively quick  the final settlement can take longer to achieve 
some of the important variables affecting our estimation of loss reserves for commercial auto liability include litigious climate  unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues  magnitude of jury awards  outside counsel costs  and frequency and timing of claims reporting 
we recorded unfavorable development of million in for this line of business as actual claim severity was higher than previously anticipated 
we recorded favorable development of million in as actual claim severity was lower than previously anticipated and unfavorable development of million in as actual claim severity was significantly higher than previously anticipated 
we continually monitor development trends in each line of business as a component of estimating future ultimate loss and related lae liabilities 
management has not made any changes to the key assumptions used in calculating current year reserves in the commercial auto liability line of business 
workers compensation 
in this long tail line of business  we provide coverage for employees who may be injured in the course of employment 
some of the important variables affecting our estimation of loss reserves for workers compensation include legislative actions and regulatory interpretations  future medical cost inflation  and timing of claims reporting 

table of contents a significant portion of our workers compensation business is written in california 
significant reforms passed by the california state legislature in and in reduced employer premiums and set treatment standards for injured workers 
however  recent judicial decisions are moderating the benefits of these reforms 
we recorded favorable prior year loss development of million in  whereas we recorded unfavorable prior year loss development of million in in  we recorded favorable prior year loss development of million primarily due to the impact of the legislation on medical claim costs being more favorable than previously anticipated 
future costs depend on the implementation and interpretation of the reforms and judicial decisions throughout the workers compensation system over the next several years 
due to the long tail nature of this business and the uncertainty surrounding recent judicial decisions  it is difficult to predict ultimate liabilities until a higher percentage of claims have been paid and the ultimate impact of these decisions can be estimated with more precision 
within each line  great american actuaries review the results of individual tests  supplementary statistical information and input from management to select their point estimate of the ultimate liability 
this estimate may be one test  a weighted average of several tests or a judgmental selection as the actuaries determine is appropriate 
the actuarial review is performed each quarter as a test of the reasonableness of management s point estimate and to provide management with a consulting opinion regarding the advisability of modifying its reserve setting assumptions for future periods 
the great american actuaries do not develop ranges of losses 
the level of detail at which data is analyzed varies among the different lines of business 
we generally analyze data by major product or coverage  using countrywide data 
we determine the appropriate segmentation of the data based on data volume  data credibility  mix of business and other actuarial considerations 
point estimates are selected based on test indications and judgment 
claims we view as potentially significant are subject to a rigorous review process involving the adjuster  claims management and executive management 
we seek to establish reserves at the maximum probable exposure based on our historic claims experience 
incurred but not yet reported ibnr reserves are determined separate from the case reserving process and include estimates for potential adverse development of the recorded case reserves 
we monitor ibnr reserves monthly with financial management and quarterly with an actuary from great american 
ibnr reserves are adjusted monthly based on historic patterns and current trends and exposures 
when a claim is reported  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
the estimate reflects informed judgment of our claims personnel based on general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel 
during the loss adjustment period  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department based on developments and periodic reviews of the cases 
individual case reserves are reviewed for adequacy at least quarterly by senior claims management 
when establishing and reviewing reserves  we analyze historic data and estimate the impact of various loss development factors  such as our historic loss experience and that of the industry  trends in claims frequency and severity  our mix of business  our claims processing procedures  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in imposition of damages and changes and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
as of december   management has not made any key assumptions that are inconsistent with historical loss reserve development patterns 
a change in any of these aforementioned factors from the assumptions implicit in our estimate can cause our actual loss experience to be better or worse than our reserves and the difference can be material 
there is no precise method  however  for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves 
currently established reserves may not prove adequate in light of subsequent actual occurrences 
to the extent that reserves are inadequate and are increased or strengthened  the amount of such increase is treated as a charge to income in the period that the deficiency is recognized 
to the extent that reserves are redundant and are released  the amount of the release is a benefit to income in the period that redundancy is recognized 
the changes we have recorded in our reserves in the past three years illustrate the potential for revisions inherent in estimating reserves 
in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net 
table of contents reserves from claims incurred prior to in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred prior to in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred prior to we did not significantly change our reserving methodology or our claims settlement process in any of these years 
the development reflected settlements that differed from the established case reserves  changes in the case reserves based on new information for that specific claim or the differences in the timing of actual settlements compared to the payout patterns assumed in our accident year ibnr reductions 
the types of coverages we offer and risk levels we retain have a direct influence on the development of claims 
specifically  short duration claims and lower risk retention levels generally are more predictable and normally have less development 
future favorable or unfavorable development of reserves from this past development experience should not be assumed or estimated 
the reserves reported in the financial statements are our best estimate 
the following table shows the breakdown of our gross loss reserves between case reserves estimated amounts required to settle claims that have already been reported  ibnr reserves estimated amounts that will be needed to settle claims that have already occurred but have not yet been reported to us  as well as reserves for possible development on known claims and lae reserves estimated amounts required to adjust  record and settle claims  other than the claim payments themselves at december  statutory lines of business case ibnr lae total dollars in thousands commercial auto liability workers compensation general liability auto physical damage private passenger inland marine commercial multiple peril other lines reinsurance recoverables 
we are also subject to credit risks with respect to our third party reinsurers 
although reinsurers are liable to us to the extent we cede risks to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all these risks 
as a result  reinsurance does not limit our ultimate obligation to pay claims to policyholders and we may not be able to recover claims made to our reinsurers 
we manage this credit risk by selecting what we believe to be quality reinsurers  closely monitoring their financial condition  timely billing and collecting amounts due and obtaining sufficient collateral when necessary 
other than temporary impairment our investments are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation risks 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
we evaluate whether impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause and amount of decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations we use in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  whether the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  economic stability of an entire industry sector or subsection  
table of contents whether the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss  the extent to which the unrealized loss is credit driven or a result of changes in market interest rates  historical operating  balance sheet and cash flow data  internally and externally generated financial models and forecasts  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  and other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 
under current other than temporary impairment accounting guidance  if management can assert that it does not intend to sell an impaired fixed maturity security and it is not more likely than not that it will have to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis  then an entity may separate the other than temporary impairments into two components the amount related to credit losses recorded in earnings and the amount related to all other factors recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
the credit related portion of an other than temporary impairment is measured by comparing a security s amortized cost to the present value of its current expected cash flows discounted at its effective yield prior to the impairment charge 
both components are required to be shown in the consolidated statements of income 
if management intends to sell an impaired security  or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the security before recovery  an impairment charge is required to reduce the amortized cost of that security to fair value 
additional disclosures required by this guidance are contained in note investments 
we closely monitor each investment that has a market value that is below its amortized cost and make a determination each quarter for other than temporary impairment for each of those investments 
during the year ended december   we recorded credit loss other than temporary impairment charges of million primarily due to a million charge on one corporate bond where management is uncertain of ultimate recovery and as a result the entire impairment was recorded as a credit loss  as well as a million charge recorded on one mortgage backed security  for which a previous impairment charge had been recorded in during the year ended december   we recorded million in total losses on securities with impairment charges  which consisted of million in credit other than temporary impairments recognized in earnings and million of non credit impairments recognized in other comprehensive income 
the other than temporary charges primarily consist of four residential mortgage backed securities with total impairment charges of million  consisting of million in credit impairments recognized in earnings and million in non credit impairments 
the impairment on these mortgage backed securities was recorded as the full principal is not expected to be collected and these securities were written down to the present value of the expected cash flows 
in addition  we recorded million in other than temporary impairment on three corporate notes that had experienced credit issues that  in our estimation  made recovery of the cost of our investments unlikely 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in other than temporary impairments 
of the million of other than temporary impairments taken during  million related to securities issued by fannie mae  freddie mac and lehman brothers holdings inc and million related to exchange traded funds 
the other than temporary impairment charge on the exchange traded funds was based on the length of time and the extent to which the market value was below cost and the uncertainty in the equity markets related to any anticipated recovery period  which is unpredictable 
the remaining other than temporary impairment charge of million is related to investments that had experienced credit issues that in our estimation made recovery of the cost of our investments unlikely 
while it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired  given the inherent uncertainty in the market  charges for other than temporary impairment could be material to net income in subsequent quarters 
management believes it is not likely that future impairment charges will have a significant effect on our liquidity

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our exposures to market risk relate primarily to our investment portfolio  which is also exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk 
we have not entered and do not plan to enter  into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
during  the financial markets remained relatively stable and interest rates remained at low levels 
in addition  the equity markets had a positive year with most indexes posting double digit gains 
as a result of these effects  we had a pre tax unrealized gain of million in our fixed maturities portfolio at december  compared with a pre tax unrealized gain of million at december  our equity securities had a pre tax unrealized gain of million at december  compared to a pre tax unrealized gain of million at december  the fair value of our fixed maturities portfolio is directly impacted by changes in interest rates  in addition to credit risk 
our fixed maturities portfolio is comprised of primarily fixed rate investments with primarily intermediate term maturities 
we believe this practice allows us to be flexible in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
we manage the portfolios of our insurance companies to attempt to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
we invest in a diverse allocation of fixed income securities to capture what we believe are adequate risk adjusted returns in an evolving investment environment 
the following table provides information about our available for sale fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to interest rate risk
