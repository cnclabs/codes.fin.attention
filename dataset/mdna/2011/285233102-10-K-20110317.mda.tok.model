changes in economic conditions or other business circumstances may affect the outcomes of management s estimates and assumptions

it is at least reasonably possible that these estimates may change in the near term 
economic lives of property and equipment we estimate the economic life of property and equipment used in the business 
expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset

the tax laws and rates could change in the future to either disallow the deductions or increase decrease the tax rates
