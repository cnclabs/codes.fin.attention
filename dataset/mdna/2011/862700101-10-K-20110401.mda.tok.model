liquidity and capital resources liquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities to meet the company s obligations and commitments  or obtain appropriate financing 
currently our liquidity needs arise primarily from debt service on indebtedness  working capital requirements and capital expenditures

this agreement provided for up to million in financing   of which was outstanding at december   and is repayable over five years  with principal payments that began on october  the loan bears a fixed interest rate of with equal amortization of principal payments plus interest 
this indebtedness is secured by  in restricted cash as required by the credit agreement 
the company has had expenditures for property  plant and equipment of   and  in the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily for production and information technology additions 
the company has no material commitments for capital expenditures at december  however  the leases for the company s two delaware facilities expire on december  and the company will have to move to a new facility or extend the leases at the existing facilities  which could require substantial renovations to these facilities 
therefore  it is expected that capital expenditures in and will exceed the levels incurred in the prior three years 
for the year ended december   the company satisfied all of its cash requirements from cash and cash equivalents on hand

based upon its cash and cash equivalents on hand  current product sales and the anticipated sales of new products  the company believes it has  or has access to  sufficient resources to meet its operating requirements at least through the next months 
the company s ability to meet its long term capital needs will depend on a number of factors  including compliance with existing and new loan covenants  the success of its current and future products  the focus and direction of its research and development program  competitive and technological advances  future relationships with corporate partners  government regulation  the company s marketing and distribution strategy  its successful sale of additional common stock and or the company successfully locating and obtaining other financing  and the success of the company s plan to make future acquisitions

contractual obligations the company is committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts its long term indebtedness and leases 
the company has no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations 
below is a schedule of the future payments that the company was obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  payments due by year and beyond total in thousands long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of long term debt see note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of operating leases critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  deferred taxes  long lived assets and stock based compensation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the consolidated results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
valuation of accounts receivable accounts receivable as of december  and december   were net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively 
the recorded allowance is continually evaluated based on current market conditions  an analysis of customer specific facts and circumstances  and the size and composition of the overall portfolio 
the current state of the economy could cause longer sales cycles resulting in increased risk that outstanding balances could become uncollectible 
if receivables are in dispute with the customer or otherwise deemed uncollectible  the corresponding amounts are written off and are charged against the allowance 
valuation of inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
for inventories that consist primarily of test kit components  bulk antibody serum and antibody products  cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
realization of inventories is dependent upon the successful marketing of our products 
judgments are made regarding the carrying value of inventory based on current market conditions 
market conditions may change depending upon competitive product introductions and customer demand 
if market conditions change or if the introduction of new products by the company impacts the market for previously released products  the company may be required to write down the cost of its inventory 
for inventories that consist of costs associated with the production of custom antibodies  cost is determined using the specific identification method 
realization of such inventories is dependent upon the successful completion of a project in accordance with customer specifications 
losses on projects in progress are recorded in the period such losses become probable and estimable 
deferred taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in making their assessment  management considers positive evidence  negative evidence  and possible tax planning strategies that could be implemented 
management also considers the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  recent earnings history  history of or potential for tax attributes such as net operating losses to expire and the ability to project future taxable income 
the company s history of cumulative pre tax losses over the most recent three year period  including  is significant negative evidence that is difficult to overcome 
in light of this negative evidence  coupled with the current economic conditions  management has concluded that it is more likely than not that the company will not realize the benefits of these tax deductible differences and has continued to provide a full valuation allowance offsetting its us federal and state net deferred tax assets at december  at december   the company had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes  which have no expiration and which correspond to a  deferred tax asset  related to operations in the united kingdom uk 
management considered positive and negative indicators in concluding that a substantial valuation allowance of approximately  was necessary for the foreign deferred tax assets of  the positive indicators include the contribution to income before taxes by the foreign operations in the uk for  and  and the expected income before taxes in the uk for and the negative indicators include a history of substantial net operating losses in the uk  the lack of income before taxes until and limitations with regard to estimating income in the uk beyond resulting from a year to year evaluation of the future need for a uk subsidiary 
as of december   the company had us federal net operating loss carryforwards  of million  including those of acquired companies  which begin to expire as follows year net operating loss in thousands total revenue recognition revenues composed of sales of immunoassay based test kits and certain antibodies and immunochemical reagents are recognized upon the shipment of the product and transfer of title or when related services are provided 
revenues associated with such products or services are recognized when persuasive evidence of an order exists  shipment of product has occurred or services have been provided  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
management is required to make judgments based on actual experience about whether or not collectability is reasonably assured 
the company enters into contracts related to the production of custom antibodies  which provide for the performance of defined tasks for a fixed price  with delivery of the product upon completion of production 
the standard time to complete a project is typically longer than days but less than months and effort is expended over the life of the project 
revenues related to sales of custom antibody projects are recognized when a project s specifications have been met and or the related materials have been shipped 
fees associated with products and services added on to a custom antibody project subsequent to delivery of the initial project are billed monthly and recognized as revenue as the services and other deliverables are provided 
valuation of goodwill and long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to its estimated discounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds an asset s fair value 
the company tests goodwill annually in a two step approach 
the first step is the comparison of the carrying value of the company  including goodwill  to the fair value of the company at the testing date 
if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the company  a second test is performed to measure the amount of an impairment charge  if any 
to measure the amount of any impairment charge  the company determines the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the company were being acquired in a business combination 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recorded an impairment charge of approximately million to writeoff goodwill and other intangible assets 
for additional information  refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation the company accounts for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value method of accounting  which requires the company to measure all employee share based compensation awards at the date of grant and recognize such expense in our consolidated financial statements 
the grant date fair value of the awards is recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period of the awards and is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
management is required to make estimates and assumptions to determine the grant date fair value of stock options  including the expected term of stock options and the volatility of our stock price in the future 
in addition  assumptions related to expected future forfeitures and performance based vesting features all impact expense recognition 
these assumptions have an impact on the valuation assigned to equity awards and the associated recognition of expense 
new accounting standards and disclosures in september  the financial accounting standards board  fasb issued accounting standard update asu no 
 revenue recognition topic multi deliverables revenue arrangements  a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  to address the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services deliverables separately rather than as a combined unit 
it establishes the accounting and reporting guidance for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities  specifically  how to separate deliverables and how to measure and allocate arrangement consideration to one or more units of accounting 
the update will be effective prospectively for revenue arrangements entered into or materially modified in fiscal years beginning on or after june  the company does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on its financial statements 
item a

the company conducts operations in the united kingdom 
the consolidated financial statements of the company are denominated in us dollars and changes in exchange rates between foreign countries and the us dollar will affect the translation of financial results of foreign subsidiaries into us dollars for purposes of recording the company s consolidated financial results 
historically  the effects of translation have not been material to the consolidated financial results
