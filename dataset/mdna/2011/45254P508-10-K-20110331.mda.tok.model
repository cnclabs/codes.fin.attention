through these channels  the company originated only loans that are eligible for sale to ginnie mae under fha programs and other government sponsored enterprises 
the company is seeking to expand its mortgage lending platform in by establishing loan production centers in different regions of the us in march  excel expanded into the pacific northwest of the us opening a regional production office in lake oswego  oregon  along with other offices throughout oregon  washington  and idaho 
excel hired an experienced senior management team along with regional sales and operational staff 
with this regional production office  excel has a mortgage origination presence throughout the west coast and in the midwest and has plans to open a gulf coast regional office in baton rouge  louisiana 
portfolio loss mitigation and real estate services the company has been able to develop and enhance its service offerings by providing services focusing on loss mitigation and performance of our own long term mortgage portfolio 
the company portfolio loss mitigation and real estate services include reo surveillance and disposition services  default surveillance and loss recovery services  short sale and real estate brokerage services  loan modifications  portfolio monitoring and reporting services 
in  the company expects to expand the portfolio loss mitigation services platform with an engagement with a third party to provide certain servicer audit  recovery and title search services for residential mortgage portfolios 
the company anticipates offering and providing similar services to additional third party customers throughout title and escrow the title insurance company services primarily california and selected national markets providing title insurance  escrow and settlement services to residential mortgage lenders  real estate agents  asset managers and reo companies in the residential real estate market 
the services are provided through a proprietary integrated technology platform 

table of contents for the years ended december  and  mortgage and real estate services fees were million and million  respectively  as follows for the year ended december  real estate services and recovery fees title and escrow loan modification fees portfolio service fees total mortgage and real estate services fees although the company intends to expand its portfolio loss mitigation and real estate services to more third parties in the marketplace  the revenues from these business activities have historically been generated from the company long term mortgage portfolio 
furthermore  as the distressed mortgage and real estate markets remain unstable and uncertain due to the significant number of foreclosure properties that need to be sold  there remains uncertainty about the ongoing need and delivery of these services in the future 
long term mortgage portfolio although we have seen some stabilization and improvement in defaults  the portfolio continues to suffer losses and may continue for the foreseeable future until we see a significant decline in the number of foreclosure properties in the market 
existing conditions are unprecedented and result in uncertainty around the long term performance of the portfolio 
at december   our residual interest in securitizations represented by the difference between trust assets and trust liabilities increased to million  compared to million at december  the increase in residual fair value in was primarily due to decreased loss assumptions for single family collateral and investor yield requirements 
in previous years  the company securitized mortgage loans by transferring originated residential single family mortgage loans and multifamily commercial loans the transferred assets into non recourse bankruptcy remote trusts which in turn issued tranches of bonds to investors supported only by the cash flows of the transferred assets 
because the assets and liabilities in the securitizations are nonrecourse to the company  the bondholders cannot look to the company for repayment of their bonds in the event of a shortfall 
these securitizations were structured to include interest rate derivatives 
the company retained the residual interest in each trust  and in most cases would perform the master servicing 
a trustee and servicer  unrelated to us  would be named for each securitization 
cash flows from the loans the loan payments and liquidation of foreclosed real estate properties collected by the loan servicer are remitted to the master servicer 
the master servicer remits payments to the trustee who remits payments to the bondholders investors 
the servicer collects loan payments and performs loss mitigation activities for defaulted loans 
these activities include foreclosing on properties securing defaulted loans  which results in reo 
in accordance with gaap  the company is required to consolidate all but one of these trusts as the company is not the master servicer on our statement of financial condition and results of operations 
for the one trust the company did not consolidate  the residual interest is reported as investment securities available for sale 
for the trusts the company did consolidate  the loans are included in the statement of financial condition as securitized mortgage collateral  the foreclosed loans are included in the statement of financial condition as real estate owned and the various bond 
table of contents tranches owned by investors are included in the statement of financial condition as securitized mortgage borrowings 
any interest rate derivatives remaining in the trusts are included in our statement of financial condition as derivative assets or derivative liabilities  respectively 
to the extent there is excess overcollateralization as defined in the securitization agreements in these securitization trusts  the company receives cash flows from the excess interest collected monthly from the residual interest the company owns 
because i the company elected the fair value option on the securitized mortgage collateral  securitized mortgage borrowings and derivative assets liabilities  and ii real estate owned is reflected at net realizable value which approximates fair market value  the net of the trust assets and trust liabilities represents the estimated fair value of what the company owns the residual interests 
to estimate fair value of the assets and liabilities within the securitization trusts each reporting period  management uses an industry standard valuation and analytical model that is updated monthly with current collateral  real estate  derivative  bond and cost servicer  trustee  etc 
information for each securitization trust 
the company employs an internal process to validate the accuracy of the model as well as the data within this model 
forecasted assumptions  sometimes referred to as curves  for defaults  loss severity  interest rates libor and prepayments are input into the valuation model for each securitization trust 
the company hires third party experts to provide forecasted curves for the aforementioned assumptions for each of the securitizations 
before inputting this information into the model  management employs a process to qualitatively and quantitatively review the assumption curves for reasonableness using other information gathered from the mortgage and real estate market ie third party home price indices  published industry reports discussing regional mortgage and commercial loan performance and delinquency as well as actual default and foreclosure information for each trust from the respective trustees 
the company uses the valuation model to generate the expected cash flows to be collected from the trust assets and the expected required bondholder distribution trust liabilities 
to the extent that the trusts are overcollateralized  the company receives the excess interest as the holder of the residual interest 
the information above provides us with the future expected cash flows for the securitized mortgage collateral  real estate owned  securitized mortgage borrowings  derivative assets liabilities  and the residual interests 
to determine the discount rates to apply to these cash flows  the company gathers information from the bond pricing services and other market participants regarding estimated investor required yields for each bond tranche 
based on that information and the collateral type and vintage  the company determines an acceptable range of expected yields an investor would require including an appropriate risk premium for each bond tranche 
the company uses the blended yield of the bond tranches together with the residual interests to determine an appropriate yield for the securitized mortgage collateral in each securitization after taking into consideration any derivatives in the securitization

net losses on trust liabilities were million as a result of losses from the increase in fair value of securitized mortgage borrowings and losses from other trust liabilities of million 
as a result non interest income net trust assets increased by million during the year ended december  to understand the financial position of the company better  we believe it is important to understand the composition of the company stockholders equity deficit and to which component of 
table of contents the business it relates 
at december   the equity deficit within our continuing and discontinued operations was comprised of the following significant assets and liabilities condensed components of stockholders equity deficit as of december  continuing operations discontinued operations total cash residual interests in securitizations note payable long term debt  par repurchase reserve lease liability deferred charge net other assets liabilities stockholders equity deficit guaranteed by imh 
continuing operations at december   cash within our continuing operations decreased to million from million at december  the primary sources of cash between periods were million in fees generated from the mortgage and real estate fee based businesses and million from residual interests in securitizations 
offsetting the sources of cash were operating expenses totaling million and million in payments on the notes payable  net of proceeds received from issuance of structured debt agreement 
since our consolidated and unconsolidated securitization trusts are nonrecourse  we have netted trust assets and liabilities to present the company interest in these trusts more simply  which are considered our residual interests in securitizations 
for unconsolidated securitizations our residual interests represent the fair value of investment securities available for sale 
for consolidated securitizations  our residual interests are represented by the fair value of securitized mortgage collateral and real estate owned  offset by the fair value of securitized mortgage borrowings and net derivative liabilities 
we receive cash flows from our residual interests in securitizations to the extent they are available after required distributions to bondholders and maintaining overcollateralization levels within the trusts 
the estimated fair value of the residual interests  represented by the difference in the fair value of trust assets and trust liabilities  was million at december   compared to million at december  in november  the company entered into an million structured debt agreement  secured by residual interests  to pay off the balance owed on the credit agreement with the last remaining warehouse lender from the payoff resulted in the full satisfaction of the note payable entered into by the company on october  at a million discount to the approximately million outstanding balance 
the new note payable entered into in november bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum and is amortized in equal principal payments over months and the balance at december  was million 
refer to note notes payable in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the structured debt agreement 

table of contents at december   we had deferred charges of million  which is amortized as a component of income tax expense in the consolidated statements of operations over the estimated life of the mortgages retained in the securitized mortgage collateral 
the deferred charges represent the deferral of income tax expense on inter company profits that resulted from the sale of mortgages from taxable subsidiaries to imh in prior years 
this balance is recorded as required by gaap and does not have any realizable cash value 
net other assets include million in loans held for sale  million in premises and equipment  million in prepaid expenses  and million in accounts receivable 
discontinued operations the company most significant liabilities within discontinued liabilities at december  relate to its repurchase reserve and a lease liability associated with the former non conforming mortgage operations 
in previous years when our discontinued operations sold loans to investors  we were required to make normal and customary representations and warranties about the loans we had previously sold to investors 
our whole loan sale agreements generally required us to repurchase loans if we breached a representation or warranty given to the loan purchaser 
in addition  we also could be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its sale 
the repurchase reserve is an estimate of losses from expected repurchases  and is based  in part  on the recent settlement of claims 
during  consistent with other mortgage lenders  we received repurchase requests from fannie mae for loans funded primarily in at december   the repurchase reserve was million as compared to million at december  in connection with the discontinuation of our non conforming mortgage  retail mortgage  warehouse lending and commercial operations  a significant amount of office space that was previously occupied is no longer being used by the company 
the company has subleased a significant amount of this office space 
at december   the company had a liability of million included within discontinued operations  representing the present value of the minimum lease payments over the remaining life of the lease  offset by the expected proceeds from sublet revenue related to this office space 
critical accounting policies we define critical accounting policies as those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
our critical accounting policies require management to make difficult and complex judgments that rely on estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain due to the affect of changing market conditions and or consumer behavior 
in determining which accounting policies meet this definition  we considered our policies with respect to the valuation of our assets and liabilities and estimates and assumptions used in determining those valuations 
we believe the most critical accounting issues that require the most complex and difficult judgments and that are particularly susceptible to significant change to our financial condition and results of operations include the following fair value of financial instruments  variable interest entities and transfers of financial assets and liabilities  net realizable value of reo  repurchase reserve  and interest income and interest expense 

table of contents fair value of financial instruments financial accounting standards board accounting standards codification fasb asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and outlines a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date also referred to as an exit price 
fair value measurements are categorized into a three level hierarchy based on the extent to which the measurement relies on observable market inputs in measuring fair value 
level  which is the highest priority in the fair value hierarchy  is based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level is based on observable market based inputs  other than quoted prices  in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level  which is the lowest priority in the fair value hierarchy  is based on unobservable inputs 
assets and liabilities are classified within this hierarchy in their entirety based on the lowest level of any input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the use of fair value to measure our financial instruments is fundamental to our financial statements and is a critical accounting estimate because a substantial portion of our assets and liabilities are recorded at estimated fair value 
financial instruments classified as level are generally based on unobservable inputs  and the process to determine fair value is generally more subjective and involves a high degree of management judgment and assumptions 
these assumptions may have a significant effect on our estimates of fair value  and the use of different assumptions  as well as changes in market conditions and interest rates  could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
as a result of the lack of observable market data resulting from inactive markets  the company has classified its investment securities available for sale  securitized mortgage collateral and borrowings  net derivative liabilities  long term debt  mortgage servicing rights  and call and put options as level fair value measurements 
level assets and liabilities were and  respectively  of total assets and total liabilities measured at estimated fair value at december  and for a detailed discussion of the determination of fair value for individual financial instruments  see note fair value of financial instruments in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
variable interest entities and transfers of financial assets and liabilities historically  the company securitized mortgages in the form of collateralized mortgage obligations cmo  which were consolidated and accounted for as secured borrowings for financial statement purposes 
the company also securitized mortgages in the form of real estate mortgage investment conduits remics  which were either consolidated or unconsolidated depending on the design of the securitization structure 
cmo and certain remic securitizations were designed so that the transferee securitization trust was not a qualifying special purpose entity qspe  and therefore the company consolidated the variable interest entity vie as it was the primary beneficiary of the sole residual interest in each securitization trust 
generally  this was achieved by including terms in the securitization agreements that gave the company the ability to unilaterally cause the securitization trust to return specific mortgages  other than through a clean up call 
amounts consolidated are included in trust assets and liabilities as securitized mortgage collateral  real estate owned  derivative assets  securitized mortgage borrowings and derivative liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
our estimate of the fair value of our net retained residual interests in unconsolidated securitizations  which are included in investment securities available for sale in the consolidated balance sheets  requires us to exercise significant judgment as to the timing and amount of future cash flows from the residual interests 
we are exposed to credit risk from the underlying mortgage loans in 
table of contents unconsolidated securitizations to the extent we retain subordinated interests 
changes in expected cash flows resulting from changes in expected net credit losses will impact the value of our subordinated retained interests and those changes are recorded as a component of change in fair value of net trust assets in contrast  for securitizations that are structured as secured borrowing  we recognize interest income over the life of the securitized mortgage collateral and interest expense incurred for the securitized mortgage borrowings 
we refer to these transactions as consolidated securitizations 
the mortgage loans collateralizing the debt securities for these financings are included in securitized mortgage collateral and the debt securities payable to investors in these securitizations are included in securitized mortgage borrowings in our consolidated balance sheet 
whether a securitization is consolidated or unconsolidated  investors in the securities issued by the securitization trust have no recourse to our non securitized assets or to us and have no ability to require us to provide additional assets  but rather have recourse only to the assets transferred to the trust 
whereas the accounting differences are significant  the underlying economic impact to us  over time  will be the same regardless of whether the securitization trust is consolidated or unconsolidated 
effective january   former qspes are evaluated for consolidation based on the provisions of fasb asc  which eliminates the concept of a qspe and changes the approach to determining a securitization trust primary beneficiary 
refer to note recently adopted accounting pronouncements in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impact the new rules will have on the company consolidated balance sheets 
net realizable value of reo the company considers the net realizable value nrv of its reo properties in evaluating reo losses 
when real estate is acquired in settlement of loans  or other real estate owned  the mortgage is written down to a percentage of the property appraised value  broker price opinion or list price less estimated selling costs and including mortgage insurance proceeds expected to be received 
subsequent changes in the nrv of the reo is reflected as a write down of reo and results in additional losses 
repurchase reserve when we have sold loans through whole loan sales we were required to make normal and customary representations and warranties about the loans to the purchaser 
our whole loan sale agreements generally required us to repurchase loans if we breach a representation or warranty given to the loan purchaser 
in addition  we may be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its sale 
investors have requested the company to repurchase loans or to indemnify them against losses on certain loans which the investors believe either do not comply with applicable representations or warranties or defaulted shortly after its purchase 
upon completion of its own investigation regarding the investor claims  the company repurchases or provides indemnification on certain loans  as appropriate 
the company maintains a liability for expected losses on dispositions of loans expected to be repurchased or on which indemnification is expected to be provided and regularly evaluates the adequacy of this repurchase liability based on trends in repurchase and indemnification requests  actual loss experience  settlement negotiations  and other relevant factors including economic conditions 
the company estimates the repurchase reserve  included in liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheet  based on the estimated trailing whole loan sales that still have 
table of contents outstanding early payment and misrepresentation warranties 
the calculation of the trailing whole loan sales subject to request is based upon historical analysis of the timing of requests in relation to their sale date 
the company also calculates the rate at which our whole loan sales will develop into early payment default or misrepresentation claims 
based on historical experience  management will determine what percentage of the claims may incur a loss 
the company applies a historical loss rate  adjusted for current market conditions based on the type of loan first lien or to a lesser extent second lien to the loans we expect to incur loss on in the future to derive the repurchase reserve 
the reserve includes the company estimate of losses in the fair value of loans the company expects it will repurchase  plus any premiums that will be refunded to the investor 
the loss in fair value is predominately determined based on several factors including recent settlements and status of current settlement negotiations 
interest income and interest expense interest income on securitized mortgage collateral and interest expense on securitized mortgage borrowings are recorded using the effective yield for the period based on the previous quarter end estimated fair value 
income taxes effective january   the company revoked its election to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit 
as a result of revoking this election  the company is subject to income taxes as a regular subchapter c corporation 
with this election  we will not be allowed to elect to be taxed as a reit until we have significant nol carryforwards from prior years 
we do not expect to be able to generate sufficient taxable income in future years to utilize these losses and have recognized a full valuation allowance against these nol carryforwards in our consolidated balance sheets

since our consolidated and unconsolidated securitization trusts are nonrecourse to the company  our economic risk is limited to our residual interests in these securitization trusts 
therefore  in the following table we have netted trust assets and trust liabilities to present these residual interests more simply 
our residual interests in securitizations are segregated between our single family sf residential and multifamily mf residential portfolios and are represented by the difference between trust assets and trust liabilities 
the following tables present the estimated fair value of our residual interests  including investment securities available for sale  by securitization vintage year and other related assumptions used to derive these values at december  estimated fair value of residual interests by vintage year origination year sf mf total total    weighted avg

discount rate vintage year includes cmo a  since the majority of the mortgages collateralized in this securitization were originated during this period 
the estimated fair values of residual interests in vintage years through is reflective of higher estimated future losses and investor yield requirements compared to earlier vintage years 
the company utilizes a number of assumptions to value securitized mortgage collateral  securitized mortgage borrowings and residual interests 
these assumptions include estimated collateral default rates and loss severities credit losses  collateral prepayment rates  forward interest rates and investor yields discount rates 
the company uses the same collateral assumptions for securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings as the collateral assumptions determine collateral cash flows which are used to pay interest and principal for securitized mortgage borrowings 
table of contents and excess spread  if any  to the residual interests 
however  the company uses different investor yield discount rate assumptions for securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings and the discount rate used for residual interests based on underlying collateral characteristics  vintage year  assumed risk and market participant assumptions see aforementioned discussion of methods used to estimate the fair value of the assets and liabilities within the securitization trusts in long term mortgage portfolio 
the table below reflects the estimated future credit losses and investor yield requirements for trust assets by product sf and mf and securitization vintage estimated future losses investor yield requirement sf mf sf mf estimated future losses derived by dividing future projected losses by unpaid principal balances at december  investor yield requirements represent the company estimate of the yield third party market participants would require to price our trust assets and liabilities given our prepayment  credit loss and forward interest rate assumptions 
as illustrated in s ps case shiller city composite home price index  from through  home price appreciation escalated to historic levels 
during through  the company originated or acquired mortgages supported by these elevated real estate values 
beginning in  deterioration in the economy resulting in high unemployment and a dramatic drop in home prices resulted in significant negative equity for borrowers 
these factors have led to significant increases in loss severities resulting from deterioration in the credit quality of borrowers  as well as strategic defaults  whereby borrowers with the ability to pay are defaulting on their mortgages based on the belief that home prices will not recover in a reasonable amount of time 
home prices have deteriorated back to december levels which has significantly reduced or eliminated equity for loans originated after future loss estimates are significantly higher for mortgage loans included in securitization vintages after which reflect severe home price deterioration and defaults experienced with mortgages originated during these periods 
cash flows from the company long term mortgage portfolio are affected by the following market and operational risks liquidity risk  interest rate risk  credit risk  and prepayment risk 
interest rate risk 
the company earnings from the long term mortgage portfolio depend largely on our interest rate spread  represented by the relationship between the yield on our interest earning assets primarily investment securities available for sale and securitized mortgage collateral and the cost of our interest bearing liabilities primarily securitized mortgage borrowings  long term debt and note payable 
our interest rate spread is impacted by several factors  including general economic 
table of contents factors  forward interest rates and the credit quality of mortgage loans in the long term mortgage portfolio 
the residual interests in our long term mortgage portfolio are sensitive to changes in interest rates on securitized mortgage collateral and the related securitized mortgage borrowings 
changes in interest rates can significantly affect the cash flows and fair values of the company assets and liabilities  as well as our earnings and stockholders equity 
the company uses derivative instruments to manage some of its interest rate risk 
however  the company does not attempt to completely hedge interest rate risk 
to help mitigate some of the exposure to the effect of changing interest rates on cash flows on securitized mortgage borrowings  the company utilized derivative instruments primarily in the form of interest rate swap agreements swaps and  to a lesser extent  interest rate cap agreements caps and interest rate floor agreements floors 
these derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
for non exchange traded contracts  fair value is based on the amounts that would be required to settle the positions with the related counterparties as of the valuation date 
valuations of derivative assets and liabilities are based on observable market inputs  if available 
to the extent observable market inputs are not available  fair values measurements include the company judgments about future cash flows  forward interest rates and certain other factors  including counterparty risk 
additionally  these values also take into account the company own credit standing  to the extent applicable  thus  the valuation of the derivative instrument includes the estimated value of the net credit differential between the counterparties to the derivative contract 
at december   derivative liabilities  net were million and reflect the securitization trust liability to pay third party counterparties based on the estimated value to settle the derivative instruments 
cash payments on these derivative instruments are based on notional amounts that are decreasing over time 
excluding the effects of other factors such as portfolio delinquency and loss severities within the securitization trusts  as the notional amount of these derivative instruments decrease over time  payments to counterparties in the current interest rate environment are reduced  thereby potentially increasing cash flows on our residual interests in securitizations 
conversely  increases in interest rates from current levels could potentially reduce overall cash flows on our residual interests in securitizations 
since our consolidated and unconsolidated securitization trusts are nonrecourse to the company  our economic risk is limited to our residual interests in these securitization trusts 
the company is also subject to interest rate risk on its long term debt consisting of trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes and notes payable 
these interest bearing liabilities include adjustable rate periods based on one month libor note payable and three month libor trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes 
the company does not currently hedge its exposure to the effect of changing interest rates related to these interest bearing liabilities 
significant fluctuations in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on the company business  financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
credit risk 
we manage credit risk by actively managing delinquencies and defaults through our servicers 
starting with the second half of we have not retained any additional alt a mortgages in our long term mortgage portfolio 
our securitized mortgage collateral primarily consists of alt a mortgages which are generally within typical fannie mae and freddie mac guidelines but have loan characteristics  which may include higher loan balances  higher loan to value ratios or lower documentation requirements including stated income loans  that make them non conforming under those guidelines 

table of contents using historical losses  current portfolio statistics and market conditions and available market data  the company has estimated future loan losses  which are included in the fair value adjustment to our securitized mortgage collateral 
while the credit performance for the loans has been clearly far worse than the company initial expectations when the loans were originated  the ultimate level of realized losses will largely be influenced by events that will likely unfold over the next several years  including the severity of housing price declines and overall strength of the economy 
if market conditions continue to deteriorate in excess of our expectations  the company may need to recognize additional fair value reductions to our securitized mortgage collateral  which may also affect the value of the related securitized mortgage borrowings and residual interests 
we monitor our servicers to attempt to ensure that they perform loss mitigation  foreclosure and collection functions according to their servicing practices and each securitization trust pooling and servicing agreement 
we have met with the management of our servicers to assess our borrowers current ability to pay their mortgages and to make arrangements with selected delinquent borrowers which will result in the best interest of the trust and borrower  in an effort to minimize the number of mortgages which become seriously delinquent 
when resolving delinquent mortgages  servicers are required to take timely action 
the servicer is required to determine payment collection under various circumstances  which will result in the maximum financial benefit 
this is accomplished by either working with the borrower to bring the mortgage current by modifying the loan with terms that will maximize the recovery or by foreclosing and liquidating the property 
at a foreclosure sale  the trusts consolidated on our balance sheet generally acquire title to the property 
we use the mortgage bankers association mba method to define delinquency as a contractually required payment being or more days past due 
we measure delinquencies from the date of the last payment due date in which a payment was received 
delinquencies for loans days late or greater  foreclosures and delinquent bankruptcies were billion or as of december  the following table summarizes the unpaid principal balances of loans in our mortgage portfolio  included in securitized mortgage collateral  loans held for investment and loans held for sale for

adjustments to the loan carrying value required at the time of foreclosure are included in the change in the fair value of net trust assets 
changes in the company estimates of net realizable value subsequent to the time of foreclosure and through the time of ultimate disposition are recorded as gains or losses from real estate owned in the consolidated statements of operations 
reo  for continuing and discontinued operations  at december  decreased million or from december   as a result of liquidations and a decrease in foreclosures 
we realized gains on the sale of real estate owned in the amount million for the year ended december   compared to a loss of million for additionally  for  the company recorded write downs of the net realizable value of the reo in the amount of million compared to write downs of million for these write downs of the net realizable value reflect declines in value of the reo subsequent to foreclosure date 
the following table presents the balances of the reo for continuing operations december  reo impairment ending balance reo inside trusts reo outside trusts total impairment represents the cumulative write downs of net realizable value subsequent to foreclosure 
amount represents reo related to former on balance sheet securitizations  which were collapsed as the result of the company exercising its clean up call options 
this reo is included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
in calculating the cash flows to assess the fair value of the securitized mortgage collateral  the company estimates the future losses embedded in our loan portfolio 
in evaluating the adequacy of these losses  management takes many factors into consideration 
for instance  a detailed analysis of historical loan performance data is accumulated and reviewed 
this data is analyzed for loss performance and prepayment performance by product type  origination year and securitization issuance 
the data is also broken down by collection status 
our estimate of losses for these loans is developed by estimating both the rate of default of the loans and the amount of loss severity in the event of default 
the rate of default is assigned to the loans based on their attributes eg  original loan to value  borrower credit score  documentation type  geographic location  etc 
and collection status 
the rate of default is based on analysis of migration of loans from each aging category 
the loss severity is determined by estimating the net proceeds from the ultimate sale of the foreclosed property 
the results of that analysis are then applied to the current mortgage portfolio and an estimate is created 
we believe that pooling of mortgages with similar characteristics is an appropriate methodology in which to evaluate the future loan losses 

table of contents management recognizes that there are qualitative factors that must be taken into consideration when evaluating and measuring losses in the loan portfolios 
these items include  but are not limited to  economic indicators that may affect the borrower ability to pay  changes in value of collateral  political factors  employment and market conditions  competitor performance  market perception  historical losses  and industry statistics 
the assessment for losses  is based on delinquency trends and prior loss experience and management judgment and assumptions regarding various matters  including general economic conditions and loan portfolio composition 
management continually evaluates these assumptions and various relevant factors affecting credit quality and inherent losses 
prepayment risk 
the company historically used prepayment penalties as a method of partially mitigating prepayment risk for those borrowers that have the ability to refinance 
the recent economic downturn  lack of available credit and declines in property values have limited borrowers ability to refinance 
these factors have significantly reduced prepayment risk within our long term mortgage portfolio 
with the seasoning of the long term mortgage portfolio  a significant portion of prepayment penalties terms have expired  thereby further reducing prepayment penalty income

net interest income we earn net interest income primarily from mortgage assets which include securitized mortgage collateral  loans held for sale and investment securities available for sale  or collectively  mortgage assets  and  to a lesser extent  interest income earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest expense is primarily interest paid on borrowings secured by mortgage assets  which include securitized mortgage borrowings and to a lesser extent  interest expense paid on reverse repurchase agreements  long term debt and notes payable 
interest income and interest expense during the period primarily represents the effective yield  based on the fair value of the trust assets and liabilities 
the following tables summarize average balance  interest and weighted average yield on mortgage assets and borrowings  included within continuing and discontinued operations  for the periods indicated 
cash receipts and payments on derivative instruments hedging interest rate risk related to our securitized mortgage borrowings are not included in the results below 
these cash receipts and payments are included as a component of the change in fair value of net trust assets 
for the year ended december  average balance interest yield average balance interest yield assets investment securities available for sale securitized mortgage collateral loans held for sale total interest earning assets liabilities securitized mortgage borrowings long term debt note payable warehouse borrowings total interest bearing liabilities net interest spread net interest margin net interest spread is calculated by subtracting the weighted average yield on interest bearing liabilities from the weighted average yield on interest earning assets 
net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest spread by total average interest earning assets 

table of contents for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net interest income spread decreased million for the year ended december  to million from million for the comparable period 
the decrease in net interest spread was primarily attributable to overall declines in yields and balances between periods and the resulting decrease in net interest income on securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings  as well as an increase in interest expense incurred on the note payable of thousand for the year ended december  as compared to none for the comparable period 
as a result  net interest margin decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the yield on interest earning assets decreased to from in the comparable period 
the yield on interest bearing liabilities decreased to for the year ended december  from for the comparable period 
in connection with the fair value accounting for investment securities available for sale and securitized mortgage collateral and borrowings  interest income and interest expense is recognized using effective yields based on estimated fair values for these instruments 
the decrease in yield for securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings is primarily related to the adoption of fasb asc  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  during the second quarter of the fair value of the securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings increased and the yields decreased as a result of the adoption which clarified the use of quoted prices in determining fair value in markets that are inactive  thus moderating the need to use distressed prices in valuing financial assets and liabilities in illiquid markets as the company had used in prior periods 
furthermore  bond prices received from pricing services and other market participants have increased over the past few quarters as investor demand for mortgage backed securities has increased 
this has resulted in an increase in fair value for both securitized mortgage collateral and securitized mortgage borrowings 
these increases in fair value have decreased the effective yields used for purposes of recognizing interest income and interest expense on these instruments

since our consolidated and unconsolidated securitization trusts are nonrecourse to the company  our economic risk is limited to our residual interests in these securitization trusts 
to better understand the economics on our residual interests in securitizations  it is necessary to consider the net effect of changes in fair value of net trust assets and 
table of contents losses from real estate owned 
all estimated future losses are included in the estimate of the fair value of securitized mortgage collateral and reo 
losses on reo are reported separately in the consolidated statement of operations as reo is a nonfinancial asset which is the only component of trust assets and liabilities that is not recorded at fair value 
therefore  reo value at the time of sale or losses from further write downs are recorded separately in the company consolidated statement of operations 
the net effect of changes in value related to our investment in all trust assets and liabilities is shown as non interest income net trust assets  which includes losses from reo 
non interest income related to our net trust assets residual interests in securitizations was million for the year ended december   compared to million in the comparable period 
the million in non interest income net trust assets was primarily attributable to increased expected net interest spread as a result of decreased loss assumptions for single family collateral and investor yield requirements during the year ended december  the million gain on net trust assets was primarily attributable to the adoption of fasb asc  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  during the second quarter of  which resulted in an increase to the fair value of net trust assets before reo losses

table of contents conditions and liquidity  business and financial statement presentation including significant accounting policies for additional information regarding the operating structure 
liquidity and capital resources our results of operations and liquidity are materially affected by conditions in the markets for mortgages and mortgage related assets  as well as the broader financial markets and the general economy 
concerns over economic recession  geopolitical issues  unemployment  the availability and cost of financing  the mortgage market and a declining real estate market contributed to increased volatility and diminished expectations for the economy and markets 
as a result of these conditions  the financial and mortgage industries suffered severe losses and several major market participants failed or have been impaired  resulting in a significant contraction in market liquidity 
this illiquidity negatively affected both the terms and availability of financing for all mortgage related assets 
due to this unprecedented volatility in the marketplace  it has become difficult to anticipate market conditions and therefore meet our liquidity objectives 
if these conditions persist  institutions from which we seek financing for our investments may tighten their lending standards or become insolvent  which could make it more difficult for us to obtain financing on favorable terms or at all 
our profitability may be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain cost effective financing 
we believe that current cash balances  cash flows from mortgage and real estate services fees generated from our long term mortgage portfolio  and residual interest cash flows from our long term mortgage portfolio are adequate for our current operating needs 
however  we believe the mortgage and real estate services market is volatile and highly competitive 
competition for loss mitigation servicing  loan modification services  title and escrow services  and other portfolio services has intensified in the past year due to the unprecedented difficult mortgage environment and severe credit tightening  coupled with the continuing recessionary economy  which has been evidenced by increasing delinquencies and defaults  eroding real estate values and government mandated modification programs 
this difficult mortgage environment has led to an increase in competitors who have recently entered or have established businesses delivering similar services 
our competitors include mega mortgage servicers  established subprime loan servicers  and newer entrants to the specialty servicing and recovery collections business 
the company efforts to market its ability to provide mortgage and real estate services for others is more difficult than many of our competitors because we have not historically provided such services to unrelated third parties  and we are not a rated primary or special servicer of residential mortgage loans as designated by a rating agency 
additionally  performance of the long term mortgage portfolio is subject to the continued deterioration in the real estate market and current economic conditions 
cash flows from our residual interests in securitizations are sensitive to delinquencies  defaults and credit losses associated with the securitized loans 
losses in excess of current estimates will reduce the residual interest cash receipts from our long term mortgage portfolio 
in response to these unprecedented market conditions and efforts to improve liquidity  the company has taken the following steps from december through december  we purchased and canceled million and exchanged million in outstanding trust preferred securities to reduce annual interest expense obligations from million to approximately million  in june  we completed the offer to purchase and consent solicitation for which the company repurchased the majority of its preferred stock and eliminated its annual preferred dividend obligation of million  
table of contents in october  we restructured and entered into a settlement agreement with the remaining reverse repurchase facility lender to remove any further exposure associated with the facility or the loans securing the facility  in november  we entered into an million structured debt agreement note payable using seven of the company subordinate residuals to pay off the balance owed on its note payable to the last remaining warehouse bank from the payoff resulted in the full satisfaction of the credit agreement entered into by the company on october  at a million discount to the approximately million outstanding balance 
this also resulted in the termination of all covenants  conditions and restrictions associated with that agreement  during  we created an integrated services platform to provide solutions to the mortgage and real estate markets 
we initiated various mortgage and real estate fee based business activities  including loan modifications  real estate disposition  monitoring and surveillance services  real estate brokerage and lending services and title and escrow services  and in october  we completed the acquisition of of amerihome mortgage corporation amerihome which is an approved seller servicer for fannie mae  freddie mac and hud  in addition to being an approved ginnie mae issuer 
the company has an option to purchase up to of amerihome  exercisable anytime from january  to december  while the company continues to pay its obligations as they become due  the ability of the company to continue is dependent upon many factors  particularly the company ability to successfully compete and grow the mortgage and real estate fee based business activities and realize the value of its long term mortgage portfolio 
there can be no assurance of the company ability to do so 
during  our operating businesses were primarily funded as follows cash flows from our mortgage and real estate fee based business activities  and cash flows from our long term mortgage portfolio residual interests in securitizations 
the company primarily used available funds as follows monthly interest and principal payments on the structured debt agreement under the terms of the indenture  settlement payment to the remaining reverse repurchase facility lender associated with the settlement agreement  and interest and principal payments on the credit agreement under the terms of the agreement associated with the settlement  interest payments on long term debt  including trust preferred securities and junior subordinated notes  lease obligations  payroll obligations  operating expenses  and repurchase loans or settle repurchase claims 
sources of liquidity fees from our mortgage and real estate service business activities 
the company earns fees from various mortgage and real estate fee based business activities  including loss mitigation  real 
table of contents estate disposition  monitoring and surveillance services  real estate brokerage and lending services and title and escrow services 
the company provides services to investors  servicers and individual borrowers primarily by focusing on loss mitigation and performance of our long term mortgage portfolio 
additionally  the company acts as the master servicer for mortgages included in our cmo and remic securitizations 
the master servicing fees we earn are generally percent per annum basis points on the declining principal balances of these mortgages plus interest income on cash held in custodial accounts until remitted to investors  less any interest shortfall 
however  due to the decline in interest rates  the interest income earned on cash held in custodial accounts has declined significantly 
cash flows from our long term mortgage portfolio residual interests in securitizations 
we receive residual cash flows on mortgages held as securitized mortgage collateral after distributions are made to investors on securitized mortgage borrowings to the extent required credit enhancements are maintained and performance covenants are complied with for credit ratings on the securitized mortgage borrowings 
these cash flows represent the difference between principal and interest payments on the underlying mortgages  affected by the following servicing and master servicing fees paid  premiums paid to mortgage insurers  cash payments receipts on derivatives  interest paid on securitized mortgage borrowings  principal payments and prepayments paid on securitized mortgage borrowings  overcollateralization requirements  actual losses  net of any gains incurred upon disposition of other real estate owned or acquired in settlement of defaulted mortgages  unpaid interest shortfall  basis risk shortfall  and bond write downs reinstated 
the company transferred seven residual interests into a bankruptcy remote trust to secure the note payable 
the note payable is to be repaid including interest from the monthly cash flows of the seven residual interests 
any excess cash flows are held by the trust to cover any monthly shortfalls from the residual interests 
if the excess cash flows reach an amount equal to the balance on the note payable  the company has the option to pay off the note payable and take title back on the residual interests 
subsequent to the repayment of the note payable  the company will receive the cash flows from the residual interests 
uses of liquidity credit agreement 
in october  the company entered into a credit agreement with its remaining reverse repurchase facility lender for a million term loan 
the borrowing under the credit agreement  which was to be paid over months had an interest rate of one month libor plus basis points and required a monthly principal and interest payment of million 
a million principal payment was due and paid in april as part of the credit agreement 
in november  the credit agreement was paid off at a million discount to the approximately million 
table of contents outstanding balance from proceeds received on the million structured debt agreement using seven of the company subordinate residual interests 
this also resulted in the termination of all covenants  conditions and restrictions associated with that agreement 
the credit agreement was fully satisfied in november as more fully described below 
structured debt agreement note payable 
in november  the company entered into an million structured debt agreement using seven of the company subordinate residuals to pay off the balance owed on its note payable to the last remaining warehouse bank from the company received net proceeds of million 
the million debt is evidenced by an indenture with deutsche bank national trust company  as trustee 
the debt bears interest at a fixed rate of per annum and is amortized in equal principal payments over months with all distributions from the underlying residuals being used to make the monthly payments 
if the cumulative residual payments are not sufficient to pay the required monthly principal and interest the company would be required to pay the difference to avoid the transfer of the residuals and the rights to the associated future cash flows to the note holder 
any excess cash flows from the residuals are included in a reserve account  which is available to cover future shortfalls 
the million borrowing was recorded as a note payable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and is current as to principal and interest payments as of december  repurchase reserve 
when we sell loans through whole loan sales we are required to make normal and customary representations and warranties about the loans to the purchaser 
our whole loan sale agreements generally require us to repurchase loans if we breach a representation or warranty given to the loan purchaser 
in addition  we may be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or if a payment default occurs on a mortgage loan shortly after its sale 
investors have requested the company to repurchase loans or to indemnify them against losses on certain loans which the investors believe either do not comply with applicable representations or warranties or defaulted shortly after its purchase 
the company records an estimated reserve for these losses at the time the loan is sold  and adjusts the reserve to reflect the estimated loss 
the repurchase reserve is included in liabilities of discontinued operations in the consolidated balance sheets 
the reserve totaled approximately million at december   compared to million at december  in determining the adequacy of the reserve for mortgage repurchases  management considers such factors as specific requests for repurchase  known problem loans  underlying collateral values  recent sales activity of similar loans  historical experience  recent settlement experience  current settlement negotiations  current market conditions and other appropriate information 
during  the company recorded a provision for repurchase losses of million included in the net earnings from discontinued operations 
financing 
the company has obtained warehouse financing and any decision to provide financing to us in the future will depend upon a number of factors  including our compliance with the terms of existing warehouse lines and credit arrangements  including any financial covenants  the ability to obtain waivers upon any noncompliance  our financial performance  industry and market trends in our various businesses  the general availability of  and rates applicable to  financing and investments  our lenders or investors resources and policies concerning loans and investments  and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities

inflation 
the consolidated financial statements and corresponding notes to the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased costs of our operations during and unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater effect on our performance than do the effects of general levels of inflation 
inflation affects our operations primarily through its effect on interest rates  since interest rates normally increase during periods of high inflation and decrease during periods of low inflation 
off balance sheet arrangements when we sell or broker loans through whole loan sales  we are required to make normal and customary representations and warranties to the loan originators or purchasers  including guarantees against early payment defaults typically days  and fraudulent misrepresentations by the borrowers
