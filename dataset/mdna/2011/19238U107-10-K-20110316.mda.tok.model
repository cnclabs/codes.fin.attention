ffom adds back to traditionally defined ffo non cash amortization of non real estate related intangible assets associated with purchase accounting 
we present ffo and ffom because we consider them important supplemental measures of operational performance 
we believe ffo is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of reits  many of which present ffo when reporting their results 
we believe that ffom allows securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate current period results to results prior to the acquisition of mea holdings  inc ffo and ffom are intended to exclude gaap historical cost depreciation and amortization of real estate and related assets  which assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes ratably over time 
historically  however  real estate values have risen or fallen with market conditions 
because ffo and ffom excludes depreciation and amortization unique to real estate  gains and losses from property dispositions and extraordinary items  they provide performance measures that  when compared year over year  reflect the impact to operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities and interest costs  providing a perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of nareit in its march white paper as amended in november and april  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo and ffom utilized by other equity reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
we adjust the nareit definition to add back noncontrolling interests in consolidated real estate partnerships before real estate related depreciation and amortization and deduct dividends on preferred stock 
further  ffo and ffom do not represent amounts available for management s discretionary use because of needed capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations  or other commitments and uncertainties 
ffo and ffom should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss computed in accordance with gaap as an indicator of our performance  nor are they indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to pay dividends or make distributions

overview we are a fully integrated  self administered  and self managed reit that invests in healthcare facilities  including medical offices and ambulatory surgery and diagnostic centers 
we focus on the ownership  delivery  acquisition  and management of strategically located healthcare facilities in the united states of america 
we have been built around understanding and addressing the specialized real estate needs of the healthcare industry and providing services from strategic planning to long term property ownership and management 
integrated delivery service offerings include strategic planning  design  construction  development and project management services for properties owned by us or by third parties 
we are building a national portfolio of healthcare properties primarily located on hospital campuses 
since our initial public offering in  we have grown through acquisitions and facility development to encompass a national footprint  including six regional offices located throughout the united states atlanta  charlotte  dallas  denver  madison  seattle  and washington  dc and property management offices 
client relationships and advance planning services give us the ability to be included in the initial project discussions that can lead to ownership and investment in healthcare properties 
in  we completed construction on three wholly owned medical office buildings located in tennessee  minnesota  and mississippi for a combined total of million and approximately  net rentable square feet 
for the minnesota and mississippi projects  we provided both development and design build architectural  engineering  and construction services 
we also acquired an outpatient surgery center in south carolina for million as a result of a client relationship 
this  net rentable square foot facility is located on campus and is leased by the hospital 
at december  we had two investment projects under construction totaling approximately  net rentable square feet with a total estimated investment of approximately million 
both projects have an estimated second half of completion date 
as of december   we owned and or managed medical office buildings and healthcare related facilities  totaling million net rentable square feet 
our portfolio consists of consolidated wholly owned and joint venture properties  comprising a total of approximately million net rentable square feet  leased  one wholly owned property in the lease up phase  comprising approximately million net rentable square feet  leased and income producing with the remaining leased and under construction for a third quarter scheduled date of occupancy  three unconsolidated joint venture properties comprising a total of approximately million net rentable square feet  and properties managed for third party clients comprising a total of approximately million net rentable square feet 
at december   of our wholly owned properties were located on hospital campuses and an additional were located off campus  but were hospital anchored 
we believe that our on campus and hospital anchored assets occupy a premier franchise location in relation to local hospitals  providing our properties with a distinct competitive advantage over alternative medical office space in an area 
as of december   our in service  consolidated wholly owned and joint venture properties were approximately occupied  with a weighted average remaining lease term of approximately years 

table of contents we derive the majority of our revenues from two main sources rents received from tenants under leases in healthcare facilities  and revenue earned from design build construction contracts and development contracts 
to a lesser degree  we have revenue from consulting and property management agreements 
we expect that rental revenue will remain stable due to multi year  non cancellable leases with annual rental increases based on the consumer price index cpi 
we have been able to maintain a high occupancy rate for our in service  consolidated wholly owned and joint venture properties  due to our focus on customer relationships 
during  we renewed of lease expirations 
generally  our property operating revenues and expenses have remained consistent over time except for growth due to property developments and property acquisitions 
the demand for our design build and development services has been  and will likely continue to be  cyclical in nature 
financial results can be affected by the amount and timing of capital spending by healthcare systems and providers  the demand for design build and development s services in the healthcare facilities market  the availability of construction level financing  and weather at the construction sites 
in periods of adverse economic conditions  our design build and development customers may be unwilling or unable to make capital expenditures and they may be unable to obtain debt or equity financings for projects 
as a result  customers may defer projects to a later date  which could reduce our revenues 
we review the value of goodwill and intangible assets on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist 
in  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million million after taxes 
we also recorded impairment charges of million million after taxes related to trade names and trademarks 
these are non cash charges 
we reviewed our position in the healthcare construction market place and our business development strategy 
based on our review of industry data  it was noted that our design build and development segment had lost market share in each of the last two years 
as a result  we lowered our expected future design build and development cash flows  which lowered the valuation of the reporting unit and caused the impairment charges 
see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
in september  our board of directors appointed raymond braun to serve as our chief executive officer and president 
our former chief executive officer  frank spencer  had announced his retirement in may and ended his full time leadership position as chief executive officer and president in september also  in september  scott ransom transitioned from president and chief executive officer of erdman company  our design build subsidiary  to senior advisor to erdman company 
james cogdell will be retiring from the board of directors in may and retire from cogdell spencer in november in december  we repaid the million senior secured term loan  which was due to mature in march  using proceeds from the issuance of series a cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred stock 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
all significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses in the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we have provided a summary of our significant accounting policies in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies are those judged to involve accounting estimates or assumptions that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for uncertain matters or susceptibility of such matters to change 
other companies in similar businesses may utilize different estimation policies and methodologies  which may impact the comparability of our results of operations and financial condition to those companies 

table of contents acquisition of real estate the price we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors  including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  the existence of above and below market tenant leases  the creditworthiness of the tenants  favorable or unfavorable financing  above or below market ground leases and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  any ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  tenant relationships  the value or negative value of above or below market leases and any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us 
each of these estimates requires significant judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
our calculation methodology is summarized in note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases 
additionally  the amortization of value or negative value assigned to above or below market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations 
useful lives of assets we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties and intangible assets for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation and amortization to record on an annual basis with respect to our assets 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income loss because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives  then we would depreciate or amortize such assets over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation or amortization expense on an annual basis 
asset impairment valuation we review the carrying value of our properties  investments in real estate partnerships  and amortizing intangible assets annually and when circumstances  such as adverse market conditions  indicate that a potential impairment may exist 
we base our review on an estimate of the future cash flows excluding interest charges expected to result from the asset s use and potential eventual disposition 
we consider factors such as future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of leasing demand  competition and other factors 
if our evaluation indicates that we may be unable to recover the carrying value of an investment  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset 
these losses have a direct impact on our net income loss because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to operating results 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future sales  backlog  occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
because cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss for properties 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
we estimate the fair value of rental properties utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis that includes projections of future revenues  expenses and capital improvement costs  similar to the income approach that is commonly utilized by appraisers 
we review the value of goodwill using an income approach and market approach on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate a potential impairment may exist 
our methodology to review goodwill impairment  which includes a significant amount of judgment and estimates  provides a reasonable basis to determine whether impairment has occurred 
however  many of the factors employed in determining whether or not goodwill is impaired are outside of our control and it is likely that assumptions and estimates will change in future periods 
these changes can result in future impairments which could be material 

table of contents the goodwill impairment review involves a two step process 
the first step is a comparison of the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
fair value is estimated by utilizing two approaches  an income approach and a market approach 
the income approach uses the reporting unit s projected operating results and discounted cash flows using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
the cash flow projections use estimates of economic and market information over the projection period  including growth rates in revenues and costs and estimates of future expected changes in operating margins and cash expenditures 
other significant estimates and assumptions include terminal value growth rates  future estimates of capital expenditures  and changes in future working capital requirements 
the market approach estimates fair value by applying cash flow multiples to the reporting unit s operating performance 
the multiples are derived from comparable publicly traded companies with similar operating and profitability characteristics 
additionally  we reconcile the total of the estimated fair values of all our reporting units to our market capitalization to determine if the sum of the individual fair values is reasonable compared to the external market indicators 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit is higher than its fair value  then an indication of impairment may exist and a second step must be performed to measure the amount of impairment 
the amount of impairment is determined by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to the carrying value of the goodwill calculated in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  then an impairment charge for the difference is recorded 
for non amortizing intangible assets  we estimate fair value by applying an estimated market royalty rate to projected revenues and discount using a weighted average cost of capital that reflects current market conditions 
if market and economic conditions deteriorate and cause declines in our stock price  increases in the estimated weighted average cost of capital  changes in cash flow multiples or projections  or changes in other inputs to goodwill assessment estimates  then a goodwill impairment review may be required prior to our next annual test 
it is reasonably possible that changes in the numerous variables associated with the judgments  assumptions  and estimates could cause the goodwill or non amortizing intangible assets to become impaired 
if goodwill or non amortizing intangible assets are impaired  we are required to record a non cash charge that could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental income related to non cancelable operating leases is recognized using the straight line method over the terms of the tenant leases 
deferred rents included in our consolidated balance sheets represent the aggregate excess of rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the rental revenue that would be recognized under the cash flow received  based on the terms of the leases 
our leases generally contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for all property operating expenses and real estate taxes we incur 
such reimbursements are recognized in the period that the expenses are incurred 
lease termination fees are recognized when the related leases are canceled and we have no continuing obligation to provide services to such former tenants 
we recognize amortization of the value of acquired above or below market tenant leases as a reduction of rental income in the case of above market leases or an increase to rental revenue in the case of below market leases 
for design build contracts  we recognize revenue under the percentage of completion method 
due to the volume  varying complexity  and other factors related to our design build contracts  the estimates required to determine percentage of completion are complex and use subjective judgments 
changes in labor costs and material inputs can have a significant impact on the percentage of completion calculations 
we have a long history of developing reasonable and dependable estimates related to design build contracts with clear requirements and rights of the parties to the contracts 
as long term design build projects extend over one or more years  revisions in cost and estimated earnings during the course of the work are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts which require the revision become known 
at the time a loss on a design build project becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is recognized in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents we receive fees for property management and development and consulting services from time to time from third parties which are reflected as fee revenue 
management fees are generally based on a percentage of revenues for the month as defined in the related property management agreements 
revenue from development and consulting agreements is recognized as earned per the agreements 
due to the amount of control we retain  most joint venture developments will be consolidated  therefore  those development fees will be eliminated in consolidation 
other income shown in the statement of operations generally includes interest income  primarily from the amortization of unearned income on a sales type capital lease recognized in accordance with gaap  and other income incidental to our operations and is recognized when earned 
we must make subjective estimates as to when our revenue is earned and the collectibility of our accounts receivable related to design build contracts and other sales  deferred rent  expense reimbursements  lease termination fees and other income 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and historical bad debts  tenant and customer concentrations  tenant and customer creditworthiness  and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income because a higher bad debt allowance would result in lower net income  and recognizing rental revenue as earned in one period versus another would result in higher or lower net income for a particular period 
income taxes we use certain assumptions and estimates in determining income taxes payable or refundable  deferred income tax liabilities and assets for events recognized differently in our consolidated financial statements and income tax returns  and income tax expense 
determining these amounts requires analysis of certain transactions and interpretation of tax laws and regulations 
we exercise considerable judgment in evaluating the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting income tax liabilities and assets 
these judgments and estimates are re evaluated on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change 
tax returns submitted by us or the income tax reported on the consolidated financial statements may be subject to adjustment by either adverse rulings by the us tax court  changes in the tax code  or assessments made by the internal revenue service irs 
we are subject to potential adverse adjustments  including but not limited to an increase in the statutory federal or state income tax rates  the permanent nondeductibility of amounts currently considered deductible either now or in future periods  and the dependency on the generation of future taxable income  including capital gains  in order to ultimately realize deferred income tax assets 
we will only include the current and deferred tax impact of our tax positions in the financial statements when it is more likely than not likelihood of greater than that such positions will be sustained by taxing authorities  with full knowledge of relevant information  based on the technical merits of the tax position 
while we support our tax positions by unambiguous tax law  prior experience with the taxing authority  and analysis that considers all relevant facts  circumstances and regulations  we must still rely on assumptions and estimates to determine the overall likelihood of success and proper quantification of a given tax position 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability 
accounting literature states that a deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of all available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is based on weighting all available evidence  including both positive and negative evidence 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 

table of contents reit qualification requirements we are subject to a number of operational and organizational requirements to qualify and then maintain qualification as a reit 
if we do not qualify as a reit  our income would become subject to us federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates which could be substantial and we could not re elect to qualify as a reit for four taxable years following the year we failed to quality as a reit 
the resulting adverse effects on our results of operations  liquidity and amounts distributable to stockholders may be material 
changes in financial condition in may  we issued approximately million shares of common stock  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds were used to reduce borrowings under the secured revolving credit facility the credit facility  to fund build to suit development projects  and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
in december  we issued approximately million shares of series a cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred stock  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
the net proceeds were used to repay the million outstanding balance under a senior secured term loan the term loan  to reduce borrowings under the credit facility  to fund build to suit development projects  and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
total assets decreased from million to million from december  to december   primarily due to goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges 
for additional information  see note in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
results of operations our income loss from operations is generated primarily from operations of our properties and design build services and to a lesser degree from consulting and property management agreements 
the changes in operating results from period to period reflect changes in existing property performance  changes in the number of properties due to development  acquisition  or disposition of properties  and the operating results of the design build and development segment 
for the year ended december   a significant proportion of our loss from operations is due to the million  net of tax  non cash impairment charge discussed previously in the overview section 
business segments we have two identified reportable segments property operations and design build and development 
we define business segments by their distinct customer base and service provided 
while we operate as a single entity  we produce discrete financial information for each segment  which is reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make resource allocation decisions and assess performance 
property operations includes real estate investment and rental activities as well as properly management for third parties 
design build and development includes design build construction activities as well as development and consulting activities

for the year ended december   ffom attributable to property operations  net of intersegment eliminations  increased million  or  compared to the same period last year 
the increase in rental revenue is primarily due to the addition of four properties  the woodlands center for specialized medicine property a consolidated real estate partnership which began operations in december  medical center physicians tower which began operations in february  university physicians grants ferry medical office building which began operations in june  and healthpartners medical dental clinics medical office building which began operations in june  as well as increases in rental rates associated with cpi increases and reimbursable expenses 
the increase in property operating and management expenses and the increase in noncontrolling interests in real estate partnerships before real estate related depreciation and amortization are primarily due to the addition of the properties previously mentioned

for the year ended december   ffom  excluding impairment charges  attributable to the design build and development segment  net of intersegment eliminations  decreased million  or  compared to the same period last year 
the decrease is due to fewer active revenue generating third party design build construction projects and lower gross margin percentages 
design build contract revenue and other sales plus development management and other income  all net of intersegment eliminations design build revenues decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
this decrease is due to a lower volume of activity as the number of active revenue generating design build construction projects has decreased from at december  to nine at december  the decreased activity is due to the current economic environment  general uncertainty regarding government health care reform implementation and government payor reimbursement rates  clients difficulty in obtaining financing  and decreased our market share 
unless we add new revenue generating design build construction projects for third parties  the number of revenue generating design build construction projects will decline further as existing projects are completed 
we are actively pursuing a number of new project opportunities for third parties and are starting to see some pick up in requests for proposals and client advance planning opportunities but there is no assurance that any of these opportunities will result in new engagements for us 
gross margin percentage design build and development revenues less design build contract and development management expenses and as a percent of revenues decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this decrease is primarily due costs being absorbed by fewer projects due to the lower volume of active projects in compared to gross margin percentage may continue to decrease in should revenue continue to decrease and fixed costs account for a larger portion of the cost of sales 
selling  general  and administrative expenses attributable to the design build and development segment decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the same period last year 
this decrease is primarily due to an allowance for uncollectible accounts that was recorded in the third quarter of related to a client project that lost financing during construction and no such allowance was recorded for the year ended december  
table of contents selling  general  and administrative for the year ended december   selling  general  and administrative expenses increased million  or  as compared to the same period last year 
excluding the changes attributable to the design build and development segment  which are discussed above  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million primarily due to compensation related payments and expenses made to mr 
cogdell  our founder as well as a member of senior management  and mr 
spencer  our former chief executive officer  offset by a decrease in professional fees related to an exploration of strategic alternatives 
during  we incurred a million charge  net of tax benefit  related to the retirement of mr 
spencer and a million charge related to the retirement of mr 
cogdell in accordance with their employment agreements 
during  we explored a range of strategic alternatives that included an assessment of potential change of control transactions  asset dispositions and acquisitions  business and portfolio combinations  debt financings and refinancings 
for the year ended december   the selling  general and administrative expense associated with this exercise totaled approximately million and included fees for consultants  accountants  attorneys  and other service providers 
there were no such expenses in depreciation and amortization for the year ended december   depreciation and amortization expenses decreased million  or  as compared to the same period last year 
the decrease is primarily due to a decrease in amortization of intangible assets due to lower carrying values resulting from the impairment recorded in the first quarter of offset by the addition of four properties  the woodlands center for specialized medicine property a consolidated real estate partnership which began operations in december  medical center physicians tower which began operations in february  university physicians grants ferry medical office building which began operations in june  and healthpartners medical dental clinics medical office building which began operations in june impairment charges we performed an interim impairment review of goodwill and intangible assets related to the design build and development business segment as of june   and an annual review as of december  for the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million million after taxes and we also recorded impairment charges of million million after taxes related to trade names and trademarks 
these are non cash charges 
we reviewed our position in the healthcare construction market place and our business development strategy 
based on our review of industry data  it was noted that our design build and development segment had lost market share in each of the last two years 
as a result  we lowered our expected future design build and development cash flows  which lowered the valuation of the reporting unit and caused the impairment charges 
due to decreases in market share  changes in our brand name  and decreased emphasis on branding  we have valued our acquired trade names and trademarks at zero as of december  we also evaluated our amortizing intangible assets and concluded no impairment existed for those assets 
an interim review of the design build and development s intangible assets was also performed on march   due to a decline in our stock price  a decline in the cash flow multiples for comparable public engineering and construction companies  and changes in the cash flow projections for the design build and development business segment resulting from a decline in backlog and delays and cancellations of client building projects 
as a result of the march   review  we recorded  during the three months ended march   an impairment charge to goodwill of million 
we also recorded impairment charges of million million after taxes related to trade names and trademarks and million million after taxes related to the amortizing intangibles of proposals and customer relationships 
these are non cash charges 
interest expense for the year ended december   interest expense increased million  or  as compared to the same period last year 
this increase is primarily due to interest on mortgage notes payable for properties that became operational december  february  and june offset by lower debt balances as we used a portion of the proceeds from the june  may  and december equity offerings to repay debt

table of contents short term liquidity needs we believe that we will have sufficient capital resources as a result of operations and the borrowings in place to fund ongoing operations and distributions required to maintain reit compliance 
we anticipate using our cash flow from continuing operations  cash and cash equivalents  and credit facility availability to fund our business operations  cash dividends and distributions  debt amortization  and recurring capital expenditures 
capital requirements for significant acquisitions and development projects may require funding from borrowings and or equity offerings 
as of december   we had million of principal and maturity payments related to mortgage notes payable due in the million is comprised of million for principal amortization and million for maturities 
of the million in maturing mortgage notes payable  million relates to alamance regional mebane outpatient center and can be extended for one year to may we believe we will be able to refinance or extend the remaining million of balloon maturities as a result of the current loan to value ratios at individual properties and preliminary discussions with lenders 
the weighted average interest rate on the debt that matures in is approximately 
we expect upon refinancing that the weighted average interest rate on this debt will be greater than 
as of december   we had no outstanding equity commitments to unconsolidated joint ventures formed prior to december  on december   we announced that our board of directors had declared a quarterly dividend of per share and operating partnership unit that was paid in cash on january   to holders of record on december  on february   we announced that our board of directors had declared a quarterly dividend of per share on our series a preferred shares for the period from december   the date of original issue  to february  the dividend was paid on march   to shareholders of record on february  long term liquidity needs our principal long term liquidity needs consist primarily of new property development  property acquisitions  and principal payments under various mortgages and other credit facilities and non recurring capital expenditures 
we do not expect that our net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet all of these long term liquidity needs 
instead  we expect to finance new property developments through cash equity capital together with construction loan proceeds  as well as through cash equity investments by our tenants or third parties 
we intend to have construction financing agreements in place before construction begins on development projects 
we expect to fund property acquisitions through a combination of borrowings under our credit facility  traditional secured mortgage financing  and equity offerings 
in addition  we may use op units issued by the operating partnership to acquire properties from existing owners seeking a tax deferred transaction 
generally we continue to expect to meet long term liquidity requirements through net cash provided by operations and through additional equity and debt financings  including loans from banks  institutional investors or other lenders  bridge loans  letters of credit  and other lending arrangements  most of which will be secured by mortgages 
we may also issue unsecured debt in the future 
we do not  in general  expect to meet our long term liquidity needs through dispositions of our properties 
in the event that we were to sell any of our properties in the future  depending on which property were to be sold  we may need to structure the sale or disposition as a tax deferred transaction which would require the reinvestment of the proceeds from such transaction in another property or the proceeds that would be available from such sales may be reduced by amounts that we may owe under the tax protection agreements entered into in connection with our formation transactions and certain property acquisitions 
in addition  our ability to sell certain of our assets could be adversely affected by the general illiquidity of real estate assets and certain additional factors particular to our portfolio such as the specialized nature of its target property type  property use restrictions and the need to obtain consents or waivers of rights of first refusal or rights of first offers from ground lessors in the case of sales of its properties that are subject to ground leases 

table of contents we intend to repay indebtedness incurred under our credit facility from time to time  for acquisitions or otherwise  out of cash flow from operations and from the proceeds  to the extent possible and desirable  of additional debt or equity issuances 
in the future  we may seek to increase the amount of the credit facility  negotiate additional credit facilities or issue corporate debt instruments 
any indebtedness incurred or issued may be secured or unsecured  short  medium or long term  fixed or variable interest rate and may be subject to other terms and conditions we deem acceptable 
we generally intend to refinance at maturity the mortgage notes payable that have balloon payments at maturity

warranties we provide standard industry warranties in our design build business  which generally are for one year after completion of a project 
buildings are guaranteed against defects in workmanship for one year after completion 
the typical warranty requires that we replace or repair the defective item 
we record an estimate for future warranty related costs based on actual historical warranty claims 
this estimated liability is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
based on analysis of warranty costs  the warranty provisions are adjusted as necessary 
while warranty costs have historically been within calculated expectations  it is possible that future warranty costs could exceed expectations 

table of contents the changes in the carrying amounts of the total warranty liabilities for the periods shown are as follows in thousands for the year ended for the year ended for the year ended december  december  december  balance at the beginning of period design build acquisition accruals settlements balance at the end of period off balance sheet arrangements we may guarantee debt in connection with certain of our development activities  including joint ventures  from time to time 
as of december   we did not have any such guarantees or other off balance sheet arrangements outstanding 
real estate taxes our leases generally require the tenants to be responsible for all real estate taxes 
inflation our leases at wholly owned and consolidated partnership properties generally provide for either indexed escalators  based on the cpi or other measures or  to a lesser extent  fixed increases in base rents 
the leases also contain provisions under which the tenants reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate taxes 
our property management and related services provided to third parties typically provide for fees based on a percentage of revenues for the month as defined in the related property management agreements 
the revenues collected from leases are generally structured as described above  with year over year increases 
we also pay certain payroll and related costs related to the operations of third party properties that we manage 
under terms of the related management agreements  these costs are reimbursed by the third party property owners 
we believe that inflationary increases in expenses will be offset  in part  by the contractual rent increases and tenant expense reimbursements described above 
seasonality business under the design build and development segment can be subject to seasonality due to weather conditions at construction sites 
in addition  construction starts and contract signings can be impacted by the timing of budget cycles at healthcare systems and providers

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our future income  cash flows and fair values relevant to financial instruments are dependent upon prevalent market interest rates 
market risk refers to the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates 
we use some derivative financial instruments to manage  or hedge  interest rate risks related to our borrowings 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and only enter into contracts with major financial institutions based on their credit rating and other factors 
as of december   we had million of consolidated debt outstanding excluding any discounts or premiums related to assumed debt 
of our total consolidated debt  million  or  was variable rate debt that is not subject to variable to fixed rate interest rate swap agreements 
of our total indebtedness  million  or  was subject to fixed interest rates  including variable rate debt that is subject to variable to fixed rate swap agreements 
the weighted average interest rate for fixed rate debt was as of december  if libor were to increase by basis points  the increase in interest expense on our variable rate debt would decrease future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
interest rate risk amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our financial instruments 
these analyses do not consider the effect of any change in overall economic activity that could occur in that environment 
further  in the event of a change of that magnitude  we may take actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  these analyses assume no changes in our financial structure
