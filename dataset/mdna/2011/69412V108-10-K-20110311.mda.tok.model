reconciliation of non gaap financial information management utilizes certain non gaap financial measures to monitor the company s performance 
while we believe the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides additional insight into our operating performance  readers of this report are urged to review the gaap results as presented in the financial statements and supplementary data in item below 
the company presents a computation of tangible equity along with tangible book value and return on average tangible equity 
the company defines tangible equity as total shareholders equity before goodwill and core deposit intangible assets 
tangible book value is calculated as tangible equity divided by total shares outstanding 
return on average tangible equity is calculated as net income divided by average tangible equity 
we believe that tangible equity and certain tangible equity ratios are meaningful measures of capital adequacy which may be used when making period to period and company to company comparisons 
tangible equity and tangible equity ratios are considered to be non gaap financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders equ ity  book value and return on average equity 
the following table presents a reconciliation of total shareholders equity to tangible equity 
total shareholders equity subtract goodwill core deposit intangibles tangible shareholders equity non gaap book value tangible book value non gaap return on average equity return on average tangible equity non gaap non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied  and are not audited 
although we believe these non gaap financial measure are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap 
summary of critical accounting policies we follow accounting standards set by the financial accounting standards board  commonly referred to as the fasb 
the fasb sets generally accepted accounting principles gaap that we follow to ensure we consistently report our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
references to gaap issued by the fasb in this report are to the fasb accounting standards codification  sometimes referred to as the codification or asc 
the fasb finalized the codification effective for periods ending on or after september  prior fasb statements  interpretations  positions  eitf consensuses  and aicpa statements of position are no longer being issued by the fasb 
the codification does not change how the company accounts for its transactions or the nature of related disclosures made 
however  when referring to guidance issued by the fasb  the company refers to topics in the asc rather than the specific fasb statement 
we have updated references to gaap in this report to reflect the guidance in the codification 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   in item of this report 
management believes that the following policies and those disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements should be considered critical under the sec definition allowance for loan losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the allowance for loan losses on outstanding loans is classified as a contra asset account offsetting outstanding loans  and the allowance for unfunded commitments is classified as an other liability on the balance sheet 
the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses charged against earnings 
the balances of the allowance for loan losses for outstanding loans and unfunded commitments are maintained at an amount management believes will be adequate to absorb known and inherent losses in the loan portfolio and commitments to loan funds 
the appropriate balance of the allowance for loan losses is determined by applying loss factors to the credit exposure from outstanding loans and unfunded loan commitments 
estimated loss factors are based on subj ective measurements including management s assessment of the internal risk classifications  changes in the nature of the loan portfolios  industry concentrations  and the impact of current local  regional  and national economic factors on the quality of the loan portfolio 
changes in these estimates and assumptions are reasonably possible and may have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  results of operations or liquidity 
goodwill and intangible assets at december   the company had  in goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with financial accounting standards  assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but instead are periodically tested for impairment 
management performs an impairment analysis of its goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives at least annually and has determined that there was no impairment as of december   and share based compensation consistent with the provisions of fasb asc  stock compensation  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based compensation  we recognize expense for the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period 
the requisite service period may be subject to performance conditions 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the grant date using the black scholes option pricing model 
management assumptions utilized at the time of grant impact the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology  and ultimately  the expens e that will be recognized over the life of the option 
additional information is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item  below 
recent accounting pronouncements recent accounting pronouncements are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   in item of this report 
none of these pronouncements are expected to have a significant effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations net interest income the largest component of the company s earnings is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income derived from earning assets  principally loans  and the interest expense associated with interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits 
the volume and mix of earning assets and funding sources  market rates of interest  demand for loans  and the availability of deposits affect net interest income 
th quarter compared to th quarter two tables follow which analyze the changes in net interest income for the fourth quarter and fourth quarter table i average balance analysis of net interest income  provides information with regard to average balances of assets and liabilities  as well as associated dollar amounts of interest income and interest expense  relevant average yields or rates  and net interest income as a percent of average earning assets 
table ii analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense  shows the increase decrease in the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense and the differences attributable to changes in either volume or rates 
the company s net interest margin for the fourth quarter was compared to for the fourth quarter quarterly margins in have been adjusted to remove fhlb stock from interest earning assets 
table i shows the yield on earning assets for the fourth quarter of was down basis points from fourth quarter earning asset yields 
the decline in earning asset yields was the result of a decline in yields on securities available for sale  a decline in yields on loans resulting from interest reversals on loans placed on nonaccrual status during the quarter and interest lost on loans on nonaccrual status  and 
a change in the mix of earning assets as average lower yielding securities represented of total average earning assets in fourth quarter compa red to in fourth quarter a portion of the decline in loan yields was mitigated by the company s use of floors on variable rate loans 
at december   interest rate floors were active on  of the company s variable rate loan portfolio 
table i also shows that the rates paid on interest bearing core deposits and interest bearing wholesale funding did not move down as fast as the decline in earning asset yields  thus causing the net interest margin to compress by basis points 
the cost of interest bearing core deposits dropped basis points  while the cost of interest bearing wholesale funding moved up basis points 
the total cost of interest bearing liabilities decreased basis points in fourth quarter when compared to fourth quarter the decline in core deposit rates was due to reductions in pricing throughout as competitive pressures abated for deposits by all financial institutions 
the increase in the cost of wholesale deposits and funding was the result of extending maturities on these instrumen ts throughout in order to mitigate the company s liability sensitive interest rate position 
table i also shows the difference between the cost of interest bearing core deposits and wholesale funding 
overall  interest bearing core deposits in fourth quarter had a rate of or basis points lower than wholesale funding costs at 
this spread widened significantly in when compared to the same quarter last year when the cost of interest bearing core deposits was only basis points below the cost of interest bearing wholesale funding 
this widening was again the result of extending maturities on wholesale funding at a higher cost to mitigate interest rate risk  while the cost of core deposits fell 
in addition  the company significantly reduced its level of low cost short term funding at the federal reserve bank of san francisco and the fhlb of seattle that also contributed to the increase in the cost of wholesale funding in fourth quarter when compared to fourth quarter table ii shows the changes in net interest income due to rate and volume for the quarter ended december  as compared to the quarter ended december  interest income including loan fees for the fourth quarter decreased by  from the same period last year 
changes in the mix of earning asset volumes  specifically the reduction in higher yielding loans and increase in lower yielding securities  caused interest income to drop by while lower yields on earning assets decreased interest income by  the rate volume analysis shows that interest expense for the quarter ended december   decreased by from last year  as changes in mix of liability volumes caused interest expense to drop by  while lower rates reduced interest expense by table i average balance analysis of net interest income dollars in thousands three months ended three months ended december  december  interest average interest average average income or yields or average income or yields or balance expense rates balance expense rates interest earning assets federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits securities available for sale taxable tax exempt loans held for sale loans  net of deferred fees and allowance total interest earning assets non earning assets cash and due from banks premises and equipment goodwill intangible assets interest receivable and other total non earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities money market and now accounts savings deposits time deposits core total interest bearing core deposits time deposits non core federal funds purchased fhlb frb borrowings trust preferred total interest bearing wholesale funding total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing liabilities demand deposits interest payable and other total noninterest liabilities total liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net interest income net interest margin nonaccrual loans have been included in average balance totals

table iv  analysis of changes in interest income and interest expense  shows the increase decrease in the dollar amount of interest income and interest expense and the differences attributable to changes in either volume or rates 
the net interest margin for the full year was a decline of basis points from the net interest margin for the year margins in have been adjusted to remove fhlb stock from interest earning assets 
table iii shows that earning asset yields declined by basis points for the year when compared to from to 
the decline in earning assets yields was primarily due to the following factors a decline in yields on securities available for sale  a decline in yields on loans resulting from interest reversals on loans placed on nonaccrual status during the quarter and interest lost on loans on nonaccrual status  and a change in the mix of earning assets as average lower yielding securities represented of total average earning assets for the year compared to in table iii also shows the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities for the year was down basis points from in to in while the cost of interest bearing core deposits fell by basis points in from  the cost of interest bearing wholesale funding moved up basis points from in to in wholesale funding costs in increased over the prior year as throughout  the company extended maturities on its wholesale funding to mitigate its liability sensitive interest rate risk position 
in addition wholesale funding costs increased in as the company significantly reduced its use of low cost overnight and short term borrowings at the fhlb of seattle and frb of san francisco as evidenced by the  decline in average borrowings for when compared to the year to date december   rate volume analysis shows that interest income including loan fees decreased by  from last year 
higher volumes of earning assets  specifically securities  increased interest income by  and lower rates on earning assets decreased interest income by  most of the decline in interest income from lower rates was due to the lower yield on the securities portfolio 
the rate volume analysis shows that interest expense for the year decreased by only from last year 
overall  increased volumes or changes in volume mix decreased the interest expense by while lower rates on interest bearing liabilities decreased interest expense by compared to the net interest margin for the full year was  a decline of basis points from the net interest margin reported for the year margins in and have been adjusted to remove fhlb stock from interest earning assets 
table iii shows that earning asset yields declined by basis points for the year when compared to from to 
the decline in earning assets yields was due primarily to the basis point drop in the yield on loans  which resulted from the rapidly declining interest rate environment experienced throughout and that lowered yields on the company s variable rate loan portfolio 
the company s use of interest rate floors on its variable rate loan portfolio mitigated a further decline in loan yields 
table iii also shows the overall cost of interest bearing liabilities was down basis points from in to in this decline can be attributed to the falling rate environment during late and into plus the relatively short maturity structure of the company s wholesale funding which permitted rapid refinancing of funding at much lower rates throughout the year as noted by the basis point decline in the cost of interest bearing wholesale funding from in to in table iii also shows that the spread between the cost of interest bearing core deposits and interest bearing wholesale funding narrowed significantly in when compared to interest bearing core deposits were basis points below the cost of interest bearing wholesale funding in  while in  the cost of interest bearing core deposits was basis points below the cost of interest bearing wholesale funding 
the rate volume analysis shows that interest income including loan fees increased by from to higher volumes of earning assets  both securities and loans  increased interest income by  and lower yields on earning assets decreased interest income by  most of the decline in interest income from lower rates was due to the lower yield on the loan portfolio 
the rate volume analysis shows that interest expense for the year decreased by  from  as higher volumes and changes in mix of deposits and wholesale funding categories caused interest expense to increase by  which was more than offset by lower rates  which decreased interest expense by  the change in mix and volumes of interest bearing wholesale funding combined with much lower rates pa id on wholesale funding were the primary drivers of lower interest expense in when compared to table iii average balance analysis of net interest income dollars in thousands twelve months ended twelve months ended twelve months ended december  december  december  interest average interest average interest average average income or yields or average income or yields or average income or yields or balance expense rates balance expense rates balance expense rates interest earning assets federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits securities available for sale taxable tax exempt loans held for sale loans  net of deferred fees and allowance total interest earning assets non earning assets cash and due from banks premises and equipment goodwill intangible assets interest receivable and other total non earning assets total assets interest bearing liabilities money market and now accounts savings deposits time deposits core total interest bearing core deposits time deposits non core federal funds purchased fhlb frb borrowings trust preferred total interest bearing wholesale funding total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing liabilities demand deposits interest payable and other total noninterest liabilities total liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity net interest income net interest margin nonaccrual loans have been included in average balance totals

the level of the allowance is determined based upon judgments regarding the size and nature of the loan portfolio  historical loss experience  the financial condition of borrowers  the level of nonperforming loans  and current general economic conditions 
additions to the allowance are charged to expense 
loans are charged against the allowance when management believes the collection of principal is unlikely 
the provision for loan losses totaled  in compared to  in the decrease in the provision for when compared to was primarily due to a significant reduction in exposure to construction and land development loans 
these loans totaled  or of outstanding loans at december   down  from the  or of outstanding loans reported at december  the company s reduced exposure to risk was further evidenced by a substantial decrease in net loan charge offs during the current year 
net loan charge offs totaled  in compared to  in the decline in net charge offs was primarily centered in construction and land development loans 
net charge offs in this category were  in compared to  in the provision for loan losses totaled  in compared to  in the increase in the provision for when compared to was due to weak economic conditions  which significantly affected the housing market  particularly impacting construction loans  which resulted in deterioration of overall credit quality of the loan portfolio

the most significant other real estate properties at december   were a residential la nd development property valued at  a commercial land development loan valued at  and a commercial construction property valued at  while nonperforming assets showed a year over year increase of  the company made significant progress during the fourth quarter in lowering nonperforming assets 
on a linked quarter basis  nonperforming assets declined  at december   when compared to the end of the third quarter the reduction in fourth quarter nonperforming assets was primarily due to the resolution of three large problem credits 
the allowance for loan losses at december   was  of gross outstanding loans  excluding loans held for sale compared to  of loans and  of loans at years ended and  respectively
