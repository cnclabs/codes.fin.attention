overview we are a financial services company that primarily lends to and invests in middle market privately held companies 
we are a closed end investment company that has filed an election to be treated as a business development company under the investment company act of  or the act 
we invest primarily in senior and subordinated debt and equity of companies in need of capital for acquisitions  divestitures  growth  development and recapitalization 
we work with the management teams or financial sponsors to seek investments with historical cash flows  asset collateral or contracted pro forma cash flows 
we seek to be a long term investor with our portfolio companies 
from our july  inception to the fiscal year ended june   we invested primarily in industries related to the industrial energy economy 
since then  we have widened our strategy to focus in other sectors of the economy and continue to reduce our exposure to the energy industry  and our holdings in the energy and energy related industries now represent less than of our investment portfolio 
the aggregate value of our portfolio investments was  and  as of june  and june   respectively 
during the fiscal year ended june   our net cost of investments increased by  or  as a result of twenty eight new investments  twelve follow on investments and revolver advances of  accrued of payment in kind interest of  and accretion of purchase discount of  while we received full repayment on fourteen investments  sold three investments and received several partial prepayments and revolver repayments totaling of  compared to the end of last fiscal year ended june   net assets increased by  or during the year ended june   from  to  this increase resulted from the issuance of new shares of our common stock less offering costs in the amount of  dividend reinvestments of  and another  from operations 
these increases  in turn  were offset by  in dividend distributions to our stockholders 
the  increase in net assets resulting from operations is net of the following net investment income of  net realized gain on investments of  and an increase in net assets due to changes in net unrealized appreciation of investments of  
table of contents market opportunity we believe that current market conditions present attractive opportunities for us to invest in middle market companies  specifically we believe that the dislocation in the credit markets that began in resulted in reduced competition  a widening of interest spreads  increased fees and generally more conservative capital structures and deal terms 
these previous market conditions may continue to create favorable opportunities to invest at attractive risk adjusted returns 
we believe that many senior lenders have  in recent years  de emphasized their service and product offerings to middle market businesses in favor of lending to large corporate clients and managing capital markets transactions 
in addition  commercial and investment banks are limited in their ability to underwrite and syndicate bank loans and high yield securities for middle market issuers as they seek to build capital and reduce leverage  resulting in opportunities for alternative funding sources and therefore higher new issue market opportunities 
we believe there is a large pool of un invested private equity capital for middle market businesses 
we expect private equity firms will seek to leverage their investments by combining equity capital with senior secured loans and mezzanine debt from other sources 
a high volume of senior secured and high yield debt was originated in the calendar years through and will come due in the near term and  accordingly  we believe that new financing opportunities will increase as many companies seek to refinance this indebtedness 
to capitalize on these opportunities  expansion of the capital base has been and may continue to be necessary 
we have demonstrated our continuing access to capital markets in several equity and debt transactions during the year ended june   from july  to december   we raised  of equity capital through our at the market program 
on december  and february   we issued  and  respectively  of senior convertible notes

investment holdings as of june   we continue to pursue our investment strategy 
in may  we changed our name to prospect capital corporation and the terminated of our policy to invest at least of our net assets in energy companies 
since that time  we have reduced our exposure to the energy industry  and our holdings in the energy and energy related industries now represent less than of our investment portfolio 
at june  approximately  or of our net assets are invested in long term portfolio investments and of our net assets invested in money market funds 
during the year ended june   we originated  of new investments 
our origination efforts recently have focused primarily on secured lending and reducing the risk in the portfolio  including a higher percentage of first lien loans than in prior periods  though we also continue to close selected junior debt and equity investments 
in addition to targeting investments senior in corporate capital structures with our new originations  we have also increased our origination business mix of third party private equity sponsor owned companies  which tend to have more third party equity capital supporting our debt investments than non sponsor transactions 
our portfolio annualized current yield decreased from as of june  to as of june  across all long term debt and certain equity investments 
we expect prospect current asset yield may decline modestly over the next few quarters as we increase the size of the portfolio while reducing credit risk 
monetization of other equity positions that we hold is not included in this yield calculation 
in many of our portfolio companies  we hold equity positions  ranging from minority interests to majority stakes  which we expect over time to contribute to our investment returns 
some of these equity positions include features such as contractual minimum internal rates of returns  preferred distributions  flip structures and other features expected to generate additional investment returns  as well as contractual protections and preferences over junior equity  in addition to the yield and security offered by our cash flow and collateral debt protections

in determining the range of value for debt instruments  management and the independent valuation firm generally shadow rated the investment and then based upon the range of ratings  determined appropriate yields to maturity for a loan rated as such 
a discounted cash flow analysis was then prepared using the appropriate yield to maturity as the discount rate  yielding the ranges 
for equity investments  the enterprise value was determined by applying ebitda multiples for similar recent investment sales 
for stressed equity investments  a liquidation analysis was prepared 
the board of directors looked at several factors in determining where within the range to value the asset including recent operating and financial trends for the asset  independent ratings obtained from third parties and comparable multiples for recent sales of companies within the industry 
the composite of all these analysis  applied to each investment  was a total valuation of  excluding money market investments 
our portfolio companies are generally lower middle market companies  outside of the financial sector  with less than  of annual ebitda 
we believe our market has experienced less volatility than others because we believe there are more buy and hold investors who own these less liquid investments 
during the year ended june   there has been a general improvement in the markets in which we operate  and market rates of interest negotiated for middle market loans have decreased 
control investments offer increased risk and reward over straight debt investments 
operating results and changes in market multiples can result in dramatic changes in values from quarter to quarter 
significant downturns in operations can further result in our looking to recoveries on sales of assets rather than the enterprise value of the investment 
several control investments in our portfolio are under enhanced scrutiny by our senior management and our board of directors and are discussed below

equity positions in the portfolio are susceptible to potentially significant changes in value  both increases as well as decreases  due to changes in operating results 
four of our portfolio companies have experienced such volatility due to improved operating results gshi  iron horse  nrg and r v 
nrg and gshi experienced meaningful increases in valuation during the year ended june   nrg due to overall industry stabilization and increased backlog resulting from a new product line  and gshi due to improved operating results 
the value of our equity position in nrg has increased to  as of june   a premium of  to its amortized cost  compared to the  unrealized gain recorded at june  the value of our equity position in gshi has increased to  as of june   a premium of  to its amortized cost  compared to the  unrealized gain recorded at june  eight of the other controlled investments have been valued at discounts to the original investment 
six of the control investments are valued at premiums to the original investment amounts  including iron horse for which our unrealized gain increased by  during the year ended june  due to improved operating results 
overall  at june   the control investments are valued at  above their amortized cost 
we hold four affiliate investments at june  the affiliate investments reported strong operating results with valuations increasing for three investments biotronic  boxercraft and sport helmets 
biotronic experienced the most meaningful increase in valuation 
biotronic completed a significant acquisition in november  which is driving the operating results and the increase in the value of the investment 
all affiliate investments are valued at amortized cost or higher 
overall  at june   affiliate investments are valued  above their amortized cost 
with the non control non affiliate investments  generally  there is less volatility related to our total investments because our equity positions tend to be smaller than with our control affiliate investments  and debt investments are generally not as susceptible to large swings in value as equity investments 
for debt investments  the fair value is limited on the high side to each loan par value  plus any prepayment premia that could be imposed 
many of the debt investments in this category have not experienced a significant change in value  as they were previously valued at or near par value 
the exception to this categorization relates to investments which were acquired in the patriot acquisition  many of which were acquired at significant discounts to par value  and any changes in operating results or interest rates can have a significant effect on the value of such investments 
h m oil gas  llc h m  shearer food  inc shearer and stryker energy  llc stryker  experienced decreases in valuations due to declines in their operating results 
at june   h m was placed on non accrual status due to the inability of the company to service its debt

included in the  is  of normal accretion   of accelerated accretion resulting from the repayment of impact products  label corp and prince  and  of accelerated accretion resulting from the recapitalization of our debt investments in arrowhead  copernicus  fischbein and northwestern 
the restructured loans for arrowhead  copernicus  fischbein and northwestern were issued at market terms comparable to other industry transactions 
in accordance with asc the cost basis of the new loan was recorded at par value  which precipitated the

capitalization our investment activities are capital intensive and the availability and cost of capital is a critical component of our business 
we capitalize our business with a combination of debt and equity 
our debt currently consists of a revolving credit facility availing us of the ability to borrow debt subject to borrowing base determinations and senior convertible notes which we issued in december and february and our equity capital is currently comprised entirely of common equity

for flexibility  we maintain a universal shelf registration statement that allows for the public offering and sale of our debt securities  common stock  preferred stock and warrants to purchase such securities in an amount up to  less issuances to date 
we may from time to time issue securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement or otherwise pursuant to private offerings 
the issuance of debt or equity securities will depend on future market conditions  funding needs and other factors and there can be no assurance that any such issuance will occur or be successful 
revolving credit facility on june   we completed a first closing on an expanded  syndicated revolving credit facility the facility 
the facility included an accordion feature which allowed the facility to accept up to an aggregate total of  of commitments for which we had  of commitments from six lenders when the facility was renegotiated

the lenders have extended current commitments of  under the syndicated facility as detailed in the recent developments 
the syndicated facility includes an accordion feature which allows the facility to be increased to up to  of commitments in the aggregate to the extent additional or existing lenders commit to increase the commitments 
we will seek to add additional lenders in order to reach the maximum size  although no 
table of contents assurance can be given we will be able to do so 
as we make additional investments which are eligible to be pledged under the syndicated facility  we will generate additional availability to the extent such investments are eligible to be placed into the borrowing base 
the revolving period of the syndicated facility extends through june  with an additional one year amortization period with distributions allowed after the completion of the revolving period 
during such one year amortization period  all principal payments on the pledged assets will be applied to reduce the balance 
at the end of the one year amortization period  the remaining balance will become due if required by the lenders 
as of june  and june   we had the ability to borrow up to  and  respectively  under our syndicated facility based on the assets pledged as collateral at that time  of which  and  was drawn  respectively 
the syndicated facility requires us to pledge assets as collateral in order to borrow under the credit facility 
at june   the investments used as collateral for the syndicated facility had an aggregate market value of  which represents of net assets

prior to june   this fee was assessed at the rate of basis points per annum of the amount of that unused portion 
for the period from june  to june   this rate increased to basis points per annum 
after june   the lenders charge a fee on the unused portion of the credit facility equal to either basis points if at least half of the credit facility is used or basis points otherwise 
concurrent with the extension of our syndicated facility  in june  we wrote off of the unamortized debt issue costs associated with the original credit facility  in accordance with asc  debt modifications and extinguishments

the conversion rate for the notes will be increased when monthly cash dividends paid to common shares exceed the rate of per share 

table of contents in no event will the total number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion exceed per  principal amount of the notes the conversion rate cap  except that  to the extent we receive written guidance or a no action letter from the staff of the securities and exchange commission the guidance permitting us to adjust the conversion rate in certain instances without regard to the conversion rate cap and to make the notes convertible into certain reference property in accordance with certain reclassifications  business combinations  asset sales and corporate events by us without regard to the conversion rate cap  we will make such adjustments without regard to the conversion rate cap and will also  to the extent that we make any such adjustment without regard to the conversion rate cap pursuant to the guidance  adjust the conversion rate cap accordingly 
we will use our commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such guidance as promptly as practicable 
prior to obtaining the guidance  we will not engage in certain transactions that would result in an adjustment to the conversion rate increasing the conversion rate beyond what it would have been in the absence of such transaction unless we have engaged in a reverse stock split or share combination transaction such that in our reasonable best estimation  the conversion rate following the adjustment for such transaction will not be any closer to the conversion rate cap than it would have been in the absence of such transaction 
upon conversion  unless a holder converts after a record date for an interest payment but prior to the corresponding interest payment date  the holder will receive a separate cash payment with respect to the notes surrendered for conversion representing accrued and unpaid interest to  but not including the conversion date 
any such payment will be made on the settlement date applicable to the relevant conversion on the notes and notes collectively  senior convertible notes 
no holder of senior convertible notes will be entitled to receive shares of our common stock upon conversion to the extent but only to the extent that such receipt would cause such converting holder to become  directly or indirectly  a beneficial owner within the meaning of section d of the securities exchange act of and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder of more than of the shares of our common stock outstanding at such time

subject to certain exceptions  holders may require us to repurchase  for cash  all or part of their notes upon a fundamental change at a price equal to of the principal amount of the notes being repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest up to  but excluding  the fundamental change repurchase date 
in addition  upon a fundamental change that constitutes a non stock change of control we will also pay holders an amount in cash equal to the present value of all remaining interest payments without duplication of the foregoing amounts on such senior convertible notes through and including the maturity date 
in connection with the issuance of the senior convertible notes  we incurred  of fees which are being amortized over the term of the facility in accordance with asc  debt modifications and extinguishments  of which  remains to be amortized 
during the year ended june   we recorded  of interest costs and amortization of financing costs as interest expense 
during the year ended june   we raised  of additional equity  net of offering costs  by issuing  shares of our common stock below net asset value diluting shareholder value by

results of operations net increase in net assets resulting from operations for the years ended june   and was   and  respectively  representing  and per weighted average share  respectively 
the primary driver of the variability in the results is the recognition of realized gains and losses and changes in unrealized gains and losses in the investment portfolio 
during the year ended june   we experienced net unrealized and realized gains of  or approximately per weighted average share  primarily from significant write ups of our investments in ajax  biotronic gshi  iron horse  nrg and sport helmets  and our sale of our common equity in fischbein and miller  for which we realized gains of  and  respectively 
these instances of realized and unrealized appreciation were partially offset by unrealized depreciation in h m  shearer and stryker 
during the year ended june   we experienced net unrealized and realized losses of  or approximately per weighted average share due primarily due to the impairment of yatesville see investment valuations for further discussion the  realized loss for yatesville was partially offset by write ups of our investments in ajax  freedom marine  h m  manx  nrg  and r v 
during the year ended june   we experienced net unrealized and realized losses of  or approximately per weighted average share 
the  realized loss for ccehi and  unrealized write down of our investment in yatesville was partially offset by write ups of our investments in gshi and nrg 
while we seek to maximize gains and minimize losses  our investments in portfolio companies can expose our capital to risks greater than those we may anticipate 
these companies are typically not issuing securities rated investment grade  have limited resources  have limited operating history  have concentrated product lines or customers  are generally private companies with limited operating information available and are likely to depend on a small core of management talents 
changes in any of these factors can have a significant impact on the value of the portfolio company 
investment income we generate revenue in the form of interest income on the debt securities that we own  dividend income on any common or preferred stock that we own  fees generated from the structuring of new deals 
our investments  if in the form of debt securities  will typically have a term of one to ten years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate 
to the extent achievable  we will seek to collateralize our investments by obtaining security interests in our portfolio companies assets 
we also may acquire minority or majority equity interests in our portfolio companies  which may pay cash or in kind dividends on a recurring or otherwise negotiated basis 
in addition  we may generate revenue in other forms including prepayment penalties and possibly consulting fees 
any such fees generated in connection with our investments are recognized as earned 
investment income  which consists of interest income  including accretion of loan origination fees and prepayment penalty fees  dividend income and other income  including settlement of net profits interests  overriding royalty interests and structuring fees  was   and  for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
during the year ended 
table of contents june   the primary driver of the increase in investment income is the deployment of additional capital in revenue producing assets through increased origination  for which we recognized an increase of  in structuring fee income  and  in cash and payment in kind interest income 
this  of interest income excludes purchase discount accretion from the assets acquired from patriot and is the result of a larger income producing investment portfolio 
these increases were partially offset by a  decline in dividend income from gshi as well as a decline  year over year  related to the one time gain of  in the fiscal year ended june   recorded upon acquiring patriot 
the primary driver of the increase from the fiscal year ended june  to the fiscal year ended june  is the acquisition of additional assets from patriot and other new investments which increased interest income for the second half of the year 
this increase is partially offset by a decline in dividend income from gshi 
the following table describes the various components of investment income and the related levels of debt investments year ended june  year ended june  year ended june  interest income dividend income other income total investment income average debt principal of investments weighted average interest rate earned average interest income producing assets have increased from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  and  for the year ended june  the average yield on interest bearing assets increased from for the year ended june  to for the year ended june  and for the year ended june  this increase in annual returns is primarily the accelerated accretion on the assets acquired from patriot on which we recognized  and  during the years ended june  and june   respectively 
without these adjustments  the weighted average interest rates earned on debt investments would have been and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
generally  interest returns have remained relatively stable over the three year period  but we have seen a decrease in interest rates on loans issued during our fourth fiscal quarter ended june  investment income is also generated from dividends and other income 
dividend income decreased from  for the year ended june  to  for the year ended june  the decrease in dividend income is primarily attributable to a decrease in the level of dividends received from our investment in gshi 
we received dividends from gshi of  and  during the years ended june  and june   respectively 
the decrease in dividends from gshi is primarily the a consequence of gshi distributing dividends in excess of their current earnings in  as gshi had accumulated excess earnings and profits available for distribution 
gshi remains profitable and has increased its ebitda in in comparison with we anticipate that gshi may be able to increase its dividends in the future as the result of organic growth and add on acquisitions 
this decrease was offset by a  increase in dividends received from american gilsonite and nrg during the year ended june  other income has come primarily from structuring fees  overriding royalty interests  and settlement of net profits interests 
comparing the year ended june  to the year ended june   income from other sources  excluding the  gain on the patriot acquisition  increased from  to  this  increase is primarily due to  of structuring fees recognized during the year ended june  primarily from the airmall  cas  crt  progrexion  safe guard  springs 
table of contents window and nmmb originations  in comparison to  of structuring fees recognized during the year ended june  comparing the year ended june  to the year ended june   income from other sources  excluding the  gain on the patriot acquisition  decreased from  to  this decrease in other income is largely due to the settlement of our net profit interests in iec ars for  during the year ended june  during the year ended june   structuring fees of  were received primarily related to biotronic and gshi  in comparison to  of structuring fees recognized during the year ended june  operating expenses our primary operating expenses consist of investment advisory fees base and incentive fees  credit facility costs  legal and professional fees and other operating and overhead related expenses 
these expenses include our allocable portion of overhead under the administration agreement with prospect administration under which prospect administration provides administrative services and facilities for us 
our investment advisory fees compensate our investment adviser for its work in identifying  evaluating  negotiating  closing and monitoring our investments 
we bear all other costs and expenses of our operations and transactions in accordance with our administration agreement with prospect administration 
operating expenses were   and  for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
the base investment advisory expenses were   and  for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
these increases are directly related to our growth in total assets 
  and  in income incentive fees were earned for the years ended june   june  and june   respectively 
the increases have occurred as net interest income has increased due primarily to an increase in the asset base 
no capital gains incentive fee has yet been incurred pursuant to the investment advisory agreement 
during the years ended june   june  and june   we incurred   and  respectively  of expenses related to our syndicated facility and senior convertible notes 
these expenses are related directly to the leveraging capacity put into place for each of those years and the levels of indebtedness actually undertaken in those years 
the table below describes the various expenses of our syndicated facility and senior convertible notes and the related indicators of leveraging capacity and indebtedness during these years 
year ended june  year ended june  year ended june  interest expense amortization of deferred financing costs commitment and other fees total weighted average debt outstanding weighted average interest rate facility amount at beginning of year the increase in interest expense for the year ended june  is due to the issuance of senior convertible notes on december  and february  for which we incurred  of interest expense 
the increase in our interest rate incurred for the year ended june  is primarily due to an increase of basis points in our borrowing rate effective june  and the concurrent introduction of a libor floor at basis points 
this increase was partially amended on june  with the closing of our current facility 
the borrowing rate and libor floor decreased by basis points and basis points  respectively 

table of contents as our asset base has grown and we have added complexity to our capital raising activities  due  in part  to our assumption of the sub administration role from vastardis fund services llc vastardis  we have commensurately increased the size of our administrative and financial staff  accounting for a significant increase in the overhead allocation from prospect administration 
over the last two years  prospect administration has increased staffing levels along with costs passed through 
the allocation of overhead expense from prospect administration were   and  for the years ended june   and  respectively 
as our portfolio continues to grow  we expect to continue to increase the size of our administrative and financial staff on a basis that provides increasing returns to scale 
however  initial investments in administrative and financial staff may not provide returns to scale immediately  perhaps not until the portfolio increases to a greater size

investment valuation our board of directors has established procedures for the valuation of our investment portfolio 
these procedures are detailed below 
investments for which market quotations are readily available are valued at such market quotations 

table of contents for most of our investments  market quotations are not available 
with respect to investments for which market quotations are not readily available or when such market quotations are deemed not to represent fair value  our board of directors has approved a multi step valuation process each quarter  as described below each portfolio company or investment is reviewed by our investment professionals with the independent valuation firm engaged by our board of directors  the independent valuation firm conducts independent appraisals and makes their own independent assessment  the audit committee of our board of directors reviews and discusses the preliminary valuation of our investment adviser and that of the independent valuation firm  and the board of directors discusses the valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith based on the input of our investment adviser  the independent valuation firm and the audit committee 
effective july   we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc or codification  fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
asc defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
asc classifies the inputs used to measure these fair values into the following hierarchy level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  accessible by us at the measurement date 
level quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets  or quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or other observable inputs other than quoted prices 
level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability 
in all cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to each investment 
in april  the fasb issued asc  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly asc 
this update provides further clarification for asc in markets that are not active and provides additional guidance for determining when the volume of trading level of activity for an asset or liability has significantly decreased and for identifying circumstances that indicate a transaction is not orderly 
asc is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june  the adoption of asc for year ended june   did not have any effect on our net asset value  financial position or results of operations as there was no change to the fair value measurement principles set forth in asc in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update  fair value measurements and disclosures topic improving disclosures about fair value measurements asc 
asu amends asc and clarifies and provides additional disclosure requirements related to recurring and non recurring fair value measurements and employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
asu is effective december   except for the disclosure about purchase  sales  issuances and settlements in the roll forward of activity in level fair value measurements 
those disclosures are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  or july  for us and for interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not believe that the 
table of contents adoption of the amended guidance in asc will have a significant effect on our financial statements 
federal and state income taxes we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company and intend to continue to comply with the requirements of the internal revenue code of the code  applicable to regulated investment companies 
we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income and intend to distribute or retain through a deemed distribution all of our investment company taxable income and net capital gain to stockholders  therefore  we have made no provision for income taxes 
the character of income and gains that we will distribute is determined in accordance with income tax regulations that may differ from gaap 
book and tax basis differences relating to stockholder dividends and distributions and other permanent book and tax differences are reclassified to paid in capital 
if we do not distribute at least of our annual income and of our capital gains in the calendar year earned  we will generally be required to pay an excise tax equal to of the amount by which of our annual ordinary income and of our capital gains exceeds the distributions from such taxable income for the year 
to the extent that we determine that our estimated current year annual taxable income will be in excess of estimated current year dividend distributions from such taxable income  we accrue excise taxes  if any  on estimated excess taxable income as taxable income is earned using an annual effective excise tax rate 
the annual effective excise tax rate is determined by dividing the estimated annual excise tax by the estimated annual taxable income 
if we fail to satisfy the annual distribution requirement or otherwise fail to qualify as a ric in any taxable year  we would be subject to tax on all of our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders  nor would we be required to make distributions 
distributions would generally be taxable to our individual and other non corporate taxable stockholders as ordinary dividend income eligible for the reduced maximum rate for taxable years beginning before but not for taxable years beginning thereafter  unless the relevant provisions are extended by legislation to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits  provided certain holding period and other requirements are met 
subject to certain limitations under the code  corporate distributions would be eligible for the dividends received deduction 
to qualify again to be taxed as a ric in a subsequent year  we would be required to distribute to our shareholders our accumulated earnings and profits attributable to non ric years reduced by an interest charge of of such earnings and profits payable by us as an additional tax 
in addition  if we failed to qualify as a ric for a period greater than two taxable years  then  in order to qualify as a ric in a subsequent year  we would be required to elect to recognize and pay tax on any net built in gain the excess of aggregate gain  including items of income  over aggregate loss that would have been realized if we had been liquidated or  alternatively  be subject to taxation on such built in gain recognized for a period of ten years 
we adopted fasb asc  income taxes asc 
asc provides guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized  measured  presented  and disclosed in the financial statements 
asc requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing our tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are more likely than not of being sustained by the applicable tax authority 
tax positions not deemed to meet the more likely than not threshold are recorded as a tax benefit or expense in the current year 
adoption of asc was applied to all open tax years as of july  the adoption of asc did not have an effect on our net asset value  financial condition or results of operations as there was no liability for unrecognized tax benefits and no change to our beginning net asset value 
as of june  and for the year then ended  we did not have a liability for any unrecognized tax benefits 
management determinations regarding asc may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based upon 
table of contents factors including  but not limited to  an on going analysis of tax laws  regulations and interpretations thereof 
revenue recognition realized gains or losses on the sale of investments are calculated using the specific identification method 
interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of discount  is recorded on an accrual basis 
origination  closing and or commitment fees associated with investments in portfolio companies are accreted into interest income over the respective terms of the applicable loans 
upon the prepayment of a loan or debt security  any prepayment penalties and unamortized loan origination  closing and commitment fees are recorded as interest income 
loans are placed on non accrual status when principal or interest payments are past due days or more or when there is reasonable doubt that principal or interest will be collected 
unpaid accrued interest is generally reversed when a loan is placed on non accrual status 
interest payments received on non accrual loans may be recognized as income or applied to principal depending upon management judgment 
non accrual loans are restored to accrual status when past due principal and interest is paid and in management judgment  are likely to remain current 
as of june   approximately of our net assets are in non accrual status 
dividend income is recorded on the ex dividend date 
structuring fees and similar fees are recognized as income as earned  usually when paid 
structuring fees  excess deal deposits  net profits interests and overriding royalty interests are included in other income 
dividends and distributions dividends and distributions to common stockholders are recorded on the ex dividend date 
the amount  if any  to be paid as a dividend or distribution is approved by our board of directors each quarter and is generally based upon our management estimate of our earnings for the quarter 
net realized capital gains  if any  are distributed at least annually 
financing costs we record origination expenses related to our credit facility and the senior convertible notes as deferred financing costs 
these expenses are deferred and amortized as part of interest expense using the straight line method for our revolving credit facility and the effective interest method for our senior convertible notes  over the respective expected life 
we record registration expenses related to shelf filings as prepaid assets 
these expenses consist principally of securities and exchange commission sec registration fees  legal fees and accounting fees incurred 
these prepaid assets will be charged to capital upon the receipt of an equity offering proceeds or charged to expense if no offering completed 
guarantees and indemnification agreements we follow asc  guarantees asc 
asc elaborates on the disclosure requirements of a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  for those guarantees that are covered by asc  the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing certain guarantees

in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update  receivables topic a creditor determination of whether a restructuring is a troubled debt restructuring asu 
asu clarifies which loan modifications constitute troubled debt restructurings 
it is intended to assist creditors in determining whether a modification of the terms of a receivable meets the criteria to be considered a troubled debt restructuring  both for purposes of recording an impairment loss and for disclosure of troubled debt restructurings 
in evaluating whether a restructuring constitutes a troubled debt restructuring  a creditor must separately conclude that both of the following exist a the restructuring constitutes a concession  and b the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
asu provides guidance to clarify whether the creditor has granted a concession and whether a debtor is experiencing financial difficulties 
the new guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after june   and applies retrospectively to restructurings occurring on or after the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption or july  for us

asu amends accounting standards codification topic  fair value measurements asc by clarifying that the highest and best use and valuation premise concepts only apply to measuring the fair value of non financial assets  allowing a reporting entity to measure the fair value of the net asset or net liability position in a manner consistent with how market participants would price the net risk position  if certain criteria are met  providing a framework for considering whether a premium or discount can be applied in a fair value measurement  providing that the fair value of an instrument classified in a reporting entity shareholders equity is estimated from the perspective of a market participant that holds the identical item as an asset  and expanding the qualitative and quantitative fair value disclosure requirements 
the expanded disclosures include  for level items  a description of the valuation process and a narrative description of the sensitivity of the fair value to changes in unobservable inputs and interrelationships between those inputs if a change in those inputs would result in a significantly different fair value measurement 
asu also requires disclosures about the highest and best use of a non financial asset when this use differs from the asset current use and the reasons for such a difference 
in addition  this asu amends accounting standards codification  fair value measurements  to require disclosures to include any transfers between level and level of the fair value hierarchy

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and equity price risk 
some of the loans in our portfolio have floating interest rates 
we may hedge against interest rate fluctuations by using standard hedging instruments such as futures  options and forward contracts subject to the requirements of the act 
while hedging activities may insulate us against adverse changes in interest rates  they may also limit our ability to participate in the benefits of higher interest rates with respect to our portfolio of investments 
during the twelve months ended june   we did not engage in hedging activities
