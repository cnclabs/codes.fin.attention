in order to evaluate the performance of these operating segments internally  we use net revenues and ebitda defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization as key performance measures of the results of operations

however  ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net earnings as determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as a measure of our operating results 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of ebitda to net income

there is a strong likelihood that the recent significant economic downturn has had  and for the foreseeable future will continue to have  a negative impact on our financial performance 
we believe that  despite uncertain economic conditions  we are in a strong financial position

ohio legislation on july   the ohio lottery commission voted unanimously to seek a declaratory judgment that it has the authority to authorize the installation of video lottery terminals at each of ohio s seven racetracks and promulgated new rules for the operation of video lottery poker machines at racetracks 
it is anticipated that video lottery terminals at one or more of ohio s racetracks may be operational during we believe that video lottery terminals at ohio racetracks will provide a competitive advantage to those racetracks and may enable them to increase their purses

the psls that were sold included those with terms of years and years and provided the purchaser the right to purchase tickets to the kentucky derby  kentucky oaks and breeders cup races each year during the term of the license 
accordingly  for tax purposes  we deferred the income for the personal seat licenses over the respective terms of the licenses

legislative and regulatory changes please refer to subheading k 
legislative changes in item business of this annual report on form k for information regarding legislative and regulatory changes 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
accordingly  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based on our historical experience  contract terms  observance of known trends in our company and the industry as a whole and information available from other outside sources 
our estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results may differ from those initial estimates 
our most significant estimates relate to the valuation of property and equipment  receivables  goodwill and other intangible assets  which may be significantly affected by changes in the regulatory environment in which we operate  and to the aggregate costs for self insured liability and workers compensation claims 
additionally  estimates are used for determining income tax liabilities 
we review the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually during the first quarter of each year or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing whether goodwill is impaired  the fair value of the related reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test consists of comparing the implied fair value of reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized equal to such excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as when determining the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
we assign estimated useful lives to our definite lived intangible assets based on the period of time the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to future cash flows 
we consider certain factors when assigning useful lives such as legal  regulatory  competition and other economic factors 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized using the straight line method 
while we believe that our estimates of future revenues and cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions could materially affect our assessment of useful lives and fair values 
changes in assumptions may cause modifications to our estimates for amortization or impairment  thereby impacting our results of operations 
if the estimated lives of our definite lived intangible assets were to decrease based on the factors mentioned above  amortization expense could increase significantly 
our business can be impacted positively and negatively by legislative and regulatory changes  by economic conditions and by gaming competition 
a significant negative impact from these activities could result in a significant impairment of our property and equipment and or our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
additional information regarding how our business can be impacted by competition and legislative changes is included in subsection j and subsection k  respectively  to item business in this annual report on form k 

table of contents in connection with losses incurred from natural disasters  insurance proceeds are collected on existing business interruption and property and casualty insurance policies 
when losses are sustained in one period and the amounts to be recovered are collected in a subsequent period  management uses estimates and judgment to determine the amounts that are probable of recovery under such policies 
estimated losses  net of anticipated insurance recoveries  are recognized in the period the natural disaster occurs and the amount of the loss is determinable 
insurance recoveries in excess of estimated losses are recognized when realizable 
we also use estimates and judgments for financial reporting to determine our current tax liability  as well as those taxes deferred until future periods 
net deferred and accrued income taxes represent significant assets and liabilities of the company 
in accordance with the liability method of accounting for income taxes  we recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
adjustments to deferred taxes are determined based upon changes in differences between the book basis and tax basis of our assets and liabilities  measured by future tax rates we estimate will be applicable when these differences are expected to reverse 
changes in current tax laws  enacted tax rates or the estimated level of taxable income or non deductible expenses could change the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and affect the overall effective tax rate and tax provision 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable that we have deemed to have a high risk of uncollectibility 
we analyze historical collection trends and customer creditworthiness when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable 
any changes in our assumptions or estimates could impact our bad debt expense and results of operations 
in  our business insurance renewals included substantially the same coverage and retentions as in previous years 
we estimate insurance liabilities for workers compensation and general liability losses based on our historical loss experience  certain actuarial assumptions of loss development factors and current industry trends 
any changes in our assumptions  actuarial assumptions or loss experience could impact our total insurance cost and overall results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in
