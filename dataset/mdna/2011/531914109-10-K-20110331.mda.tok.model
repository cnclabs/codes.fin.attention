other developments on august  the usda ruled to exempt kefir beverages from the class i milk classification  which provides exemptions from the class i definition for kefir and other drinkable yogurt products containing at least percent yogurt by weight as well as products intended to be meal replacements 
the final rule will take effect january  this change from class to class costing should have a positive impact on what lifeway pays for its key milk ingredient  which is about percent of the products cost of goods sold 
in addition to having a positive effect on gross margins  the improved input costs will allow all of lifeway s kefir based products to be more competitive with other non class i milk products  such as yogurts in the marketplace 
this expected increase in cash flow will provide greater financial flexibility  enabling the company to expand marketing efforts or retain cash for future initiatives
