net sales comparative information for fiscal and  respectively  is as follows dollars in millions year ended september  increase decrease net sales aerospace components for fixed wing aircraft rotorcraft engine components for power generation units commercial product sales and other revenue total the increase in net sales of forged components for fixed wing aircraft during fiscal  compared with fiscal  is principally due to increased demand for spare components for turbine engines 
the decrease in net sales of forged components for rotorcraft is principally attributable to reduced sales volume as a result of a large customer adjusting its inventory levels of certain components 
the increase in net sales of engine components for power generation units and commercial products is due to the impact of the acquisition of twf during the first quarter of fiscal the forge group s aerospace components have both military and commercial applications 
net sales of such components that solely have military applications were million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal this decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in the sales volumes of components associated with several military programs 
demand for additional military helicopters and related replacement components are the primary driver of sales demand of components that are for military applications 
the forge group s selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales  in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is principally due to i million amortization of intangible assets related to the acquisition of twf  ii increased depreciation and consulting costs related to the recently implemented company wide management information system and iii fiscal having been favorably impacted by the recovery of previously reserved accounts receivable

the asc group s selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  in fiscal  compared with million  or of net sales in fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is principally attributable to i increased variable selling expenses  which includes an increase in sales promotion efforts and ii increased consulting costs related to the recently implemented company wide management information system 
the asc group s operating income in fiscal was million  compared with million in the same period in fiscal this improvement in operating income is principally due to i the favorable impact on margins from increased sales volumes and ii the achievement of certain efficiencies resulting in reduced labor costs that occurred in fiscal  compared to the same period in fiscal this was partially offset by higher material cost as a percentage of net sales due to product mix 
corporate unallocated expenses corporate unallocated expenses  consisting of corporate salaries and benefits  legal and professional and other expenses that are not related to and  therefore  not allocated to the business segments  increased million to million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal principally due to i million higher legal and professional expenses primarily resulting from costs associated with acquisition activities  ii million higher compensation and related benefits costs and iii a million increase in corporate governance related costs resulting from a restructuring of director compensation

these items were partially offset by i a million increase in inventories and ii a million increase in accounts receivable 
these changes in the components of working capital do not reflect the impact of the opening balance sheet related to the acquisition of twf and were due primarily to factors resulting from normal business conditions of the company  including i the relative timing of collections from customers and ii the relative timing of payments to suppliers and tax authorities 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal capital expenditures during fiscal consisted of million by the forge group  million by the asc group and million by the repair group 
in addition to the million expended during fiscal  million has been committed as of september  the company anticipates that total fiscal capital expenditures will be within the range of to million and will relate principally to the further enhancement of production and product offering capabilities across all three of the company s business groups

critical accounting policies and estimates allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of certain customers to make required payments 
the company evaluates the adequacy of its allowances for doubtful accounts each quarter based on the customers credit worthiness  current economic trends or market conditions  past collection history  aging of outstanding accounts receivable and specific identified risks 
as these factors change  the company s allowances for doubtful accounts may change in subsequent periods 
historically  losses have been within management s expectations and have not been significant 
inventories the company maintains allowances for obsolete and excess inventory 
the company evaluates its allowances for obsolete and excess inventory each quarter 
each business segment maintains formal policies  which require at a minimum that reserves be established based on an analysis of the age of the inventory 
in addition  if the company learns of specific obsolescence  other than that identified by the aging criteria  an additional reserve will be recognized as well 
specific obsolescence may arise due to a technological or market change  or based on cancellation of an order 
management s judgment is necessary in determining the realizable value of these products to arrive at the proper allowance for obsolete and excess inventory 
impairment of long lived assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
this review involves judgment and is performed using estimates of future undiscounted cash flows  which include proceeds from disposal of assets and which the company considers a critical accounting estimate 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is greater than the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  then the long lived asset is considered impaired and an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
in projecting future undiscounted cash flows  the company relies on internal budgets and forecasts  and projected proceeds upon disposal of long lived assets 
the company s budgets and forecasts are based on historical results and anticipated future market conditions  such as the general business climate and the effectiveness of competition 
the company believes that its estimates of future undiscounted cash flows and fair value are reasonable  however  changes in estimates of such undiscounted cash flows and fair value could change the company s estimates of fair value  which could result in future impairment charges 
impairment of goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets of an acquired business 
the determination of the fair value of assets and liabilities acquired typically involves obtaining independent appraisals of certain tangible and intangible assets and may require management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding future events 
goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to an impairment testing annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
for the purposes of impairment testing  goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to the reporting entity expected to benefit from the business combination 
goodwill impairment testing involves the comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit  which is determined by its discounted cash flows  with its carrying value 
the company allocates the fair value of the reporting unit to all of its assets  other than goodwill  and liabilities 
any remaining unallocated fair value is then allocated to goodwill as its implied fair value 
the amount of impairment loss is equal to the excess of the carrying value of goodwill over the implied fair value of goodwill 
purchase price allocations the costs of business acquisitions are allocated to the acquired assets and liabilities based on their respective fair value at the time of the acquisition 
the determination of fair values typically involves obtaining independent appraisals of certain tangible and intangible assets and may require management to make certain assumptions and estimates regarding future events 
in determining fair value  management may develop a number of possible future cash flow scenarios to which probabilities are judgmentally assigned and evaluated 
this allocation process impacts the company s reported assets and liabilities and future net income 
defined benefit pension plan expense the company maintains three defined benefit pension plans in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of erisa 
the amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for pension benefits under these three defined benefit pension plans are determined on an actuarial basis utilizing various assumptions 
the discussion that follows provides information on the significant assumptions elements associated with these defined benefit pension plans 
one significant assumption in determining net pension expense is the expected return on plan assets 
the company determines the expected return on plan assets principally based on i the expected return for the various asset classes in the respective plans investment portfolios and ii the targeted allocation of the respective plans assets 
the expected return on plan assets is developed using historical asset return performance as well as current and anticipated market conditions such as inflation  interest rates and market performance 
should the actual rate of return differ materially from the assumed expected rate  the company could experience a material adverse effect on the funded status of its plans and  accordingly  on its related future net pension expense 
another significant assumption in determining the net pension expense is the discount rate 
the discount rate for each plan is determined  as of the fiscal year end measurement date  using prevailing market spot rates from an appropriate yield curve with maturities corresponding to the expected timing date of the future defined benefit payment amounts for each of the respective plans 
such corresponding spot rates are used to discount future years projected defined benefit payment amounts back to the fiscal year end measurement date as a present value 
a composite discount rate is then developed for each plan by determining the single rate of discount that will produce the same present value as that obtained by applying the annual spot rates 
the discount rate may be further revised if the market environment indicates that the above methodology generates a discount rate that does not accurately reflect the prevailing interest rates as of the fiscal year end measurement date deferred tax valuation allowance the company accounts for deferred taxes in accordance with the provisions of the accounting standards codification asc guidance related to accounting for income taxes  whereby the company recognizes an income tax benefit related to its consolidated net losses and other temporary differences between financial reporting basis and tax reporting basis 
e 
impact of newly issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard update asu  intangibles goodwill and other  which allows an entity to first assess the qualitative factors to determine whether it is necessary to perform a two step quantitative goodwill impairment test 
under this new guidance  an entity would not be required to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit unless the entity determines  based on qualitative assessment  that it is more likely than not that its fair value is less than the carrying amount 
the asu is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted  including for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed as of a date before september  the company adopted this asu during the fourth quarter of fiscal in september  the fasb issued asu  disclosures about an employer s participation in a multiemployer plan which requires the company to provide additional quantitative and qualitative disclosures for multiemployer pension plans and multiemployer other postretirement benefit plans 
the asu is effective for fiscal years ending after december   with early adoption permitted 
the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
in june  the fasb issued asu  presentation of comprehensive income  to improve the comparability of financial reporting and to facilitate the convergence of us generally accepted accounting principles and international financial reporting standards 
the asu amends the guidance in asc  comprehensive income  by eliminating the option to present components of other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
the new guidance i requires entities to present all non owner changes in stockholders equity either as a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or as two separate but consecutive statements and ii provides entities with the option to present the total of comprehensive income  the components of net income  and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements 
this update is effective for public companies with fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures 
in december  the fasb issued asu  disclosure of supplementary pro forma information for business combinations a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force  to amend asc  business combinations  regarding how public entities disclose supplemental pro forma information for business combinations 
under the amended guidance  a public entity that presents comparative financial statements must disclose the revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combination that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the prior annual reporting period and it also requires public entities to provide a description of the nature and amount of any material  nonrecurring pro forma adjustments directly attributable to business combination s that are included in the reported pro forma revenue and earnings 
this update is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements and related disclosures
