item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results we are the market and technology leader in spm software applications and services  sold to companies of every size throughout the world 
companies use spm solutions to optimize investments in sales planning and performance 
these solutions are designed to enable businesses to achieve new insights into the principal levers that drive sales force performance and specific business objectives  so they can repeat sales successes for more sustainable  predictable sales growth 
our software suite is based on our proprietary technology and extensive expertise in sales performance management  and provides the flexibility and scalability required to meet the dynamic spm requirements of global companies of every size across multiple verticals 
we sell our products and services both directly through our sales force and in conjunction with our strategic partners 
we also offer professional services  including configuration  integration and training  generally on a time and materials basis 
while we offer our customers a range of purchasing and deployment options  from on demand subscription to on premise term based licensing  our business model is focused on recurring revenue 
we generate recurring subscription and support revenues from our on demand service  support and maintenance agreements associated with our product licenses  all of which is recognized ratably over the term of the related agreement 
recurring revenue growth in  we effectively completed the transition to our recurring revenue business model from a perpetual license business model 
recurring revenues for were million  up over the prior year 
as a percentage of total revenues  recurring revenues accounted for as compared to recurring revenues of for we reported four consecutive quarters of revenue growth in and grew our on demand subscription and term based license revenues by million to million  representing a increase over comparable revenues 
customer attrition remains low as our retention rates for our software as a service saas offering and legacy on premise customers remain above for we expect recurring revenues to run at approximately of total revenues through in we retained over of all our customers and in our on demand business we only lost two customers due to their own restructuring challenges 
we believe our retention rates are on the high end of industry standards for a recurring revenue business 
we believe our high retention rates are also a testament to the quality of service we provide and the quality of our customer base 
total revenues for the year were million  down million or from the prior year 
this decrease reflects the anticipated reduction in license and services revenues related to our business model change 
total license revenue for the year was million  a decrease of million from services revenue decreased by from million in to million in as expected  the shift in revenue mix from perpetual license revenue to more predictable recurring revenue resulted in reduced services revenue as the average implementation time for a recurring revenue arrangement is significantly less than under the perpetual license model 
improved operating results during  we continued to benefit from our cost cutting actions to better align our cost base with our recurring revenue business model 
our operating expenses decreased by million  or  to million in from million in 
table of contents to supplement our operating results presented on a basis in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  we use non gaap measures of operating results 
non gaap operating results non gaap operating results is derived from gaap loss from operations adjusted for noncash or nonrecurring expenses 
we believe non gaap operating result is useful as one of the bases for measuring our operating performance  comparing the impact of our cost control measures between periods  and our ability to invest in new business opportunities 
we believe that measuring our operations using non gaap results provides more useful information to management and investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to our financial condition and ongoing results 
we use these measures to compare our performance to that of prior periods for trend analyses  for purposes of determining executive incentive compensation  and for budget and planning purposes 
these measures are used in monthly financial reports prepared for management and in quarterly financial reports presented to our board of directors 
we believe that these non gaap financial measures serve as an additional tool for investors to use in evaluating ongoing operating results and trends and in comparing our financial measures with other companies in our industry  many of which present similar non gaap financial measures to investors 
we do not consider such non gaap measures in isolation or as an alternative to such measures determined in accordance with gaap 
the principal limitation of such non gaap financial measures is that they exclude significant expenses that are required by gaap to be recorded 
in addition  they are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which charges are excluded from the non gaap financial measures 
our presentation of non gaap operating results excludes stock based compensation  restructuring expenses  amortization of acquired intangible assets  and impairment of an acquired intangible asset 
in order to compensate for these limitations  we present our non gaap financial measures in connection with our gaap results 
we urge investors to review the reconciliation of our non gaap financial measures to the comparable gaap financial measures included below  and not to rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
year ended december  year ended december  in thousands gaap loss from operations exclude stock based compensation expenses restructuring expenses amortization of acquired intangible assets impairment of an acquired intangible asset non gaap loss from operations our non gaap financial measures as set forth in the table above exclude the following stock based compensation expense 
stock based compensation expense consists of expenses for stock options and stock awards that we began recording in accordance with asc during the first quarter of these expenses are excluded in our non gaap financial measures because stock based compensation amounts are difficult to forecast 
this is due in part to the magnitude of the charges which depends upon the volume and timing of stock option grants  which can vary dramatically from period to period  and external factors such as interest rates and the trading price and volatility of our 
table of contents common stock 
we believe that this exclusion provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operating results because these non gaap financial measures facilitate the comparison of results for future periods with results from past periods 
restructuring expenses 
restructuring expenses were excluded to facilitate a more meaningful comparison to our prior year results and to the results of other companies in the same industry 
amortization of acquired intangible assets 
in accordance with gaap  operating expenses include amortization of acquired intangible assets which are amortized over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
amortization of acquired intangible assets is excluded from our non gaap financial measures because we believe that such exclusion facilitates comparisons to its historical operating results and to the results of other companies in the same industry  which have their own unique acquisition histories 
impairment of an acquired intangible asset 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge in as a result of our annual impairment test for indefinite lived intangibles at which time we determined that the value of the tradename was impaired and that we no longer intended to utilize it on an indefinite basis 
we believe this exclusion facilitates a more meaningful comparison to prior periods 
second half non gaap profitability our cost control combined with higher gross profit helped us realize a non gaap operating profit during the second half of year ended december  first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter in thousands gaap loss from operations exclude stock based compensation expenses restructuring expenses amortization of acquired intangible assets impairment of an acquired intangible asset non gaap profit loss from operations other business highlights on january   we completed the acquisition of actek 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid actek sole stockholder million in a combination of cash and stock and assumed debt of million 
we also agreed to pay additional consideration during the first quarter of contingent on the achievement of specified operational milestones on january  the milestone payments consisted of three components cash of   shares of the company common stock in the form of restricted stock units  and  shares of the company common stock in the form of a non qualified stock option 
the milestones were achieved and the cash payment of  occurred in february the restricted stock units and stock options vested in full upon approval of the milestone achievement by company board of directors in january the fair value of the consideration associated with the restricted stock units and stock options was classified as equity as of the acquisition date  the cash contingent consideration was classified as a liability 
actek is a leading provider of commissions and compliance software for complex selling environments for the insurance and financial services industries 
on december   we signed a definitive agreement to acquire all of the assets of our partner forcelogix 
under the terms of the agreement  we agreed to pay approximately million in cash 
subsequent to year end  in february we completed the acquisition 
accordingly  accounting for 
table of contents the acquisition of forcelogix is not reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  forcelogix is a leading provider of saas based coaching and talent development solutions that helps organizations optimize and increase the effectiveness of their sales force 
their solution is pre integrated with our on demand monaco suite 
challenges and risks in response to market demand over the past few years  we shifted our primary business focus from the sale of perpetual licenses for our products to the provision of our software as a service through our on demand offering 
this recurring revenue model provides more predictable quarterly revenues for us while improving the customers overall revenue experience 
towards the end of we began offering our on premise products under a time based term license arrangement 
we believe this offering better addresses the needs of our customers that prefer our on premise solution  and at the same time  will provide us more predictable revenue streams 
if we are unable to continue to significantly grow our on demand business or continue to provide our on demand services on a consistently profitable basis in the future  or if our on premise time based term license offering fails to achieve market acceptance  our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
in addition to acquiring new customers  we must maintain a keen focus on retaining our existing customers 
if our customers renewal rates decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors  including their reduced spending levels  their decision to do more of the work themselves internally  or dissatisfaction with our service  or if our customers do not renew their subscriptions for our on demand services or maintenance support  our revenue will decline and our business will suffer 
from a business perspective  while we have a number of sales opportunities in process and additional opportunities coming from our sales pipeline  we continue to experience wide variances in the timing and size of our transactions and the timing of revenue recognition resulting from flexibility in contract terms 
we believe one of our major challenges continues to be increasing prospective customers prioritization of purchasing our products and services over competing it projects 
to address this challenge  we have set goals that include expanding our sales efforts  promoting our on demand services and continuing to develop new products and enhancements to our suite of products 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenues has been derived from sales of our products and services to customers in the financial and insurance industries 
consolidations and business failures in these industries could result in substantially reduced demand for our products and services 
in addition  future disruptions in these industries and international financial crisis may cause potential customers to defer or cancel future purchases of our products and services as they seek to conserve resources in the face of economic turmoil 
any of these developments  or the combination of these developments  may materially and adversely affect our revenues  operating results and financial condition in future periods 
we remain committed to sustaining the profitable growth we achieved in the second half of however  we will need to continue to execute on a number of our key operating initiatives to ensure attainment of this goal  including adding new customers and retaining existing customers  continuing to improve recurring revenues and services revenues margins and prudent management of operating expenses 
many of the factors affecting our ability to succeed in these initiatives are wholly or partially beyond our control 
if our efforts prove insufficient or ineffective or result in unanticipated disruption to our business  our ability to sustain profitability may be materially impaired 
in addition to these risks  our future operating performance is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in risk factors in section a of this annual report on form k 

table of contents application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations which follows is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
the application of gaap requires our management to make assumptions  judgments and estimates that affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure regarding these items 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
on a regular basis  we evaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we also discuss our critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that the assumptions  judgments and estimates involved in the accounting for revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts and service remediation reserve  stock based compensation  valuation of acquired intangible assets  goodwill impairment  long lived asset impairment and income taxes have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements 
these areas are key components of our results of operations and are based on complex rules which require us to make judgments and estimates  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
historically  our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to our critical accounting policies have not differed materially from actual results 
for a more detailed discussion of these accounting policies and our use of estimates  refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all four revenue recognition criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  we have delivered the product or performed the service  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
changes in assumptions or judgments or changes to the elements in a software arrangement could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
allowance for doubtful accounts and service remediation reserve we must make estimates of the uncollectability of accounts receivable 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  international situations such as currency devaluation and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required and such provision may be material 
stock based compensation stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
stock based compensation expense for restricted stock units rsus is determined 
table of contents based on the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we measure the value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
the determination of the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected term of the options  taking into account projected exercises  our expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  the risk free interest rate  estimated forfeitures and expected dividends  which we determine as follows expected term is determined based on historical experience  giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior as influenced by changes to the terms of its stock based awards 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility over the expected term 
risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield currently available on us treasury zero coupon issues with a remaining term equivalent to the expected term 
estimated forfeitures are based on voluntary termination behavior as well as analysis of actual option forfeitures 
expected dividends are estimated at zero based on our history and intentions of not declaring and paying dividends 
changes in these variables could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and thus could materially affect our operating results 
goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment we complete our impairment tests for goodwill and acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives on an annual basis  during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or more frequently  if changes in facts and circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill and acquired intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  we typically estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
based on these key assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of external and internal factors  including industry and economic trends and changes in our business strategy or our internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
we completed our annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of and determined there was no impairment of goodwill 
as of december   the company noted impairment indicators for one of its acquired intangible assets and recognized a charge of approximately  equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the fair value of the asset 
we currently believe that there is no significant risk of future material impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives as of december  long lived asset impairment we evaluate impairment of our long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of the assets to be held and used based on the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated 
table of contents future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group 
upon classification of long lived assets as held for sale  such assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and we cease further depreciation or amortization 
we evaluated impairment of our long lived assets and determined there was one acquired intangible asset that met the criteria for impairment 
refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impairment charge taken in accounting for income taxes income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year 
in addition  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
management must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes and also our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the current provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
we have established reserves for income taxes to address potential exposures involving tax positions that could be challenged by tax authorities 
although we believe our assumptions  judgments and estimates are reasonable  changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of potential tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income  such as income from operations or capital gains income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could render our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new revenue recognition standards for arrangements with multiple deliverables  where certain of those deliverables are non software related 
accounting standards update asu no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements a consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force asu updates the existing multiple element revenue arrangement guidance currently included under accounting standards codification asc  revenue recognition multiple element arrangements 
the revised guidance permit entities to initially use management estimate of selling price esp to value individual deliverables when those deliverables do not have vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value or when third party evidence tpe is not available 
additionally  these new standards modify the manner in which the transaction consideration is allocated across the separately identified deliverables by no longer permitting the residual method of allocating arrangement consideration 
these new standards are effective for annual periods beginning after june  the company will adopt these new standards for new or materially modified arrangements entered into after january  we are in the process of evaluating the impact of adoption of these new standards on our consolidated financial statements for and the years thereafter 

table of contents the adoption of asu is applicable only to our non software transactions as our software transactions will continue to be accounted for using guidance applicable to software transactions 
prior to the adoption of asu  the company has established fair value using vsoe for all elements of the non software transactions except for fixed fee implementation service arrangements as we were not able to establish vsoe or tpe for the fixed fee service arrangements for the implementation of our on demand offerings 
as a result  the company typically recognized hosting fees and fixed fee service arrangements revenue ratably over the remaining non cancellable period once the fixed fee implementation was completed 
the company will now allocate hosting services and fixed fee implementation services revenue in the consolidated statement of operations based on a relative selling price allocation 
as a result of the adoption of asu  the company will allocate revenue to each element in an arrangement based on a selling price hierarchy 
the best estimated selling price for a deliverable is based on its vsoe  if available  tpe  if vsoe is not available  or esp  if neither vsoe nor tpe is available 
for fixed fee service agreements  when sold with hosting products  the company will use esp as it has not previously been able to establish vsoe or tpe for such services 
hosting revenue will be allocated based on its best estimated selling price which is established by a contractually stated renewal rate 
the company intends to use average billing rate for fixed fee service arrangements to establish the esp for fixed fee service arrangements when sold with our hosting products 
the arrangement consideration allocated to hosting services will be recognized as revenue over the stated contractual period based on best estimated selling price based on the provisions of asc the arrangement consideration allocated to fixed fee service arrangements will be recognized as revenue when the services are provided in accordance with the provisions of asc based on best estimated selling price 
the total arrangement consideration for a multiple element arrangement will be allocated based on the relative best estimated selling price of each element unless the fee allocated to the hosting under this method is less than the fee subject to refund if the performance conditions are not met 
in these instances  since the professional services are generally completed prior to completion of the hosting  the allocation of the fee for hosting will be at least equal to the contractual amounts subject to the performance conditions

total revenues were million  down from the decrease was primarily due to expected declines in license and services revenues  which were partially offset by the growth in our recurring revenues in the decrease was reflective of the transition of our business model 
recurring revenues 
recurring revenues  consisting of on demand arrangements  time based on premise arrangements and maintenance revenues  increased by million  or  in compared to the increase was primarily due to the growth in our on demand subscription revenues and our time based term licenses  which together increased by million or as compared to the prior year 
maintenance revenues associated with perpetual licenses decreased by million in compared to  which was primarily due to a number of on premise customers converting to our on demand service as well as decreased perpetual license sales to new customers  partially offset by a small benefit from the january actek acquisition 
services revenues 
services revenues decreased by million  or  in compared to the decrease from the prior year was expected as we completed our transition to our on demand business model  which requires shorter and less expensive implementations 
license revenues 
perpetual license revenues decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to our transition in our business model 
as a result  our perpetual license business in north america and emea continues to diminish in importance 
we expect to continue to execute perpetual license transactions in emerging markets  such as asia pacific and latin america  as they have been slower to adopt a recurring revenue model 
however  we expect these revenues to fluctuate from period to period and in any case we do not expect perpetual license revenue to return to its historical levels 
cost of revenues and gross profit cost of recurring revenues 
cost of recurring revenues increased by million  or  in compared to the increase was primarily due to increased infrastructure cost attributable to the growth in on demand subscription revenue coupled with increased amortization of intangible assets attributable to increased costs of third party technology supporting our on demand business 
the costs of recurring revenues as a percentage of related revenues remained flat on a year over year basis at 
the costs associated with supporting our on demand offering are generally higher than the cost of 
table of contents maintenance related to our on premise customers  as we are responsible for the full operation of the software that the customer has contracted for in our hosting facility 
cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues decreased by million  or  in compared to the decrease year over year was primarily attributable to a decrease in headcount during  related to the expected reduction in services revenues as discussed above 
cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues decreased by million  or  in compared to the decrease was primarily the result of our transition to a recurring revenue business 
as a result of the transition  we have allocated to the cost of license revenues a lower portion of the amortization expense for intangible assets comprised of third party technology used in our products 
gross profit 
our overall gross profit as a percentage of total revenues increased from in to in this was primarily because our on demand revenues  which have a higher gross profit than our service revenues  accounted for the majority of total revenue in as compared to in  our recurring revenues accounted for of total revenues as compared to of total revenues for our recurring revenues gross profit remained relatively flat at for both and as noted above  the cost of recurring revenues in absolute dollars increased to support the increase in on demand subscription revenues  but remained flat on a year over year basis as a percentage of revenues which increased due to sizable growth in on demand subscription revenues and our time based term licenses 
services gross profit decreased from in to negative in the negative services margin reflects lower than planned utilization resulting from certain customers delaying the start of our implementation projects and a decrease in our average billing rate for the first half of  offset in part by improved utilization and average billing rate in the second half of while we expect improvement in our services gross profit in  we do not expect it to return to the level it was under our legacy perpetual license business model 
license gross profit remained relatively flat on a year over year basis

sales and marketing expenses decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to the cost cutting actions instituted in 
table of contents to better align our cost base and our resources with our business model 
the decrease is due to lower personnel related expenses as a result of a reduction in headcount as well as a decrease in commission payments of million attributable to the decline in perpetual license revenues 
for financial reporting purposes  commission expenses associated with on demand arrangements are deferred and then amortized over the non cancelable term of the contract as the related revenue is recognized  whereas commission expenses related to perpetual license sales are incurred in the period the transaction occurs 
commission expenses associated with time based term licenses have the same treatment as commission expenses associated with on demand arrangements 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  in compared to as a result of our actions to better align our resources with our business model  we benefited from a decrease in personnel related expenses associated with a reduction in headcount in  partially offset in part by an increase in professional fees as we expanded our use of offshore third party technical services and support 
we intend to continue to invest significantly in our research and development efforts because we believe these efforts are essential to maintaining our competitive position 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in compared to the increase year over year was primarily due to a million increase in stock based compensation expenses related to grants of restricted stock units in the first and third quarters of resulting in higher period expense allocation 
the restricted stock units granted in the first quarter were for retention purposes given a salary freeze instituted for the restricted stock units granted in the third quarter were for retention purposes in response to the relocation of our corporate headquarters during that quarter

recurring revenues  consisting of on demand arrangements  time based on premise arrangements and maintenance revenues  increased by million  or  in compared to the increase was primarily the result of an increase of million in subscription revenues related to on demand and business operations services in this increase was attributable to the increase in the number of existing on demand customers for which we recognized revenue as all elements of the related customer contracts began to be performed during compared to we introduced our time based term license offering in the third quarter of total revenue generated from this new offering was million during support revenues for maintenance services decreased by million in compared to  primarily as a result of a number of on premise customers converting to our on demand service and decreased perpetual license sales to new customers 
services revenues 
services revenues decreased by million  or  in compared to the decrease was primarily a result of combined effect of shorter on demand implementation time  the challenging economic environment and reduced on premise license sales 
services revenue for benefitted from a one time fee of approximately million paid to us by two of our customers that were acquired and subsequently terminated our services 

table of contents license revenues 
perpetual license revenues decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease was primarily attributable to the change in our business model 
cost of revenues and gross profit cost of recurring revenues 
cost of recurring revenues increased by million  or  in compared to the increase was primarily due to increased cost of fulfilling higher level of customer orders resulting from the increase in on demand subscription revenue  increased amortization of intangible assets resulting from higher cost of third party technology used in our products  the allocation of a relatively greater portion of such amortization expense to the cost of recurring revenues as such revenues compose a greater portion of total revenues and  in certain periods  increased labor and infrastructure costs associated with customers going live with our on demand offering 
the costs associated with supporting our on demand offering are generally higher than the cost of maintenance related to our on premise customers  as we are responsible for the full operation of the software that the customer has contracted for in our hosting facility 
cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues decreased by million  or  in compared to the decrease was attributable to the decrease in related services revenues as discussed above and related decreases in personnel and subcontractor costs 
cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues decreased by million  or  in compared to the decrease was primarily the result of the change in our business model 
as a result of the transition  we have allocated to the cost of license revenues a lower portion of the amortization expense for intangible assets comprised of third party technology used in our products 
gross profit 
our overall gross profit decreased to in from in this was primarily a result of our business model shifting to on demand from perpetual license sales 
license revenues historically has had a higher margin  however  in the revenues declined as a percentage of total revenues as compared to at the same time  recurring revenues increased as a percentage of total revenues in as compared to and  as explained above  increased as we changed our business model 
our recurring revenue gross profit declined from in to in the decrease was primarily due to the increase in higher cost on demand revenue and additional costs  including the amortization expense for intangible assets comprised of third party technology used in our products and costs associated with customers going live  as discussed above 
services gross profit increased from in to in the increase was primarily due to the progress we made during the first half of the year to improve utilization 
services gross profit was adversely impacted during the fourth quarter of as a result of lower than planned utilization and a decrease in our average billing rate 
license gross profit decreased from in to in the decrease in license gross profit reflected the lower license revenue offset against the fixed cost of license generated by the amount of intangible assets amortization allocated to license sales

the reductions in commission expenses are  in part  reflective of the shift of our business focus to our on demand offering and away from the license model

commission expenses associated with the new time based term licenses have the same treatment as commission expenses associated with on demand arrangements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is also a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
refer to note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our auction rate security 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes  and we invest in investment grade securities 
we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our investment portfolios  which is approved by our board of directors 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one security issue  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk are short term investments  long term investments and trade receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
we mitigate market risk by monitoring ratings  credit spreads and potential downgrades for all bank counterparties on at least a quarterly basis 
based on our on going assessment of counterparty risk  we will adjust our exposure to various counterparties 
interest rate risk 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of investments in money market accounts  certificates of deposit  high quality corporate debt obligations  united states government obligations  and auction rate securities 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities  which typically have a shorter duration  may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may decrease in the future due to changes in interest rates 
at december   the average maturity of our investments was approximately months  and all investment securities other than the one remaining auction rate security had maturities of less than months 
the following table presents certain information about our financial instruments except for the auction rate security at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands  except for interest rates expected maturity year or less more than year total principal amount total fair value available for sale securities weighted average interest rate our exposure to interest rate risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments 
as of december   we had no outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money 
therefore  we currently have no exposure to interest rate risk related to debt instruments 
to the extent we enter into or issue debt instruments in the future  we will have interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues and our expenses  except those related to our non united states operations  are generally denominated in united states dollars 
for our operations 
table of contents outside the united states  we transact business generally in various other currencies 
for  approximately of our total revenue was denominated in foreign currency 
at december   approximately of our total accounts receivable was denominated in foreign currency 
our exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
the overall decrease in revenue for as compared to reflects a million adverse effect due to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we expect to continue to transact a majority of our business in us dollars 
occasionally  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had no outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we had million of losses related to forward exchange contracts for we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the immediate future 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that our foreign exchange rate contract investment strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately 
in particular  generally  we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure 
we cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations or cash flows
