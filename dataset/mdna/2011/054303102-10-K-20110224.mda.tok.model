refer to the non gaap financial measures on page of this annual report for a description of how constant dollar constant growth rates a non gaap financial measure are determined 
overview we are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products 
our business is conducted worldwide  primarily in the direct selling channel 
we presently have sales operations in countries and territories  including the us  and distribute products in more 
our reportable segments are based on geographic operations in six regions latin america  north america  central eastern europe  western europe  middle east africa  asia pacific  and china 
we have centralized operations for global brand marketing  global sales and supply chain 
our product categories are beauty  fashion and home 
beauty consists of color cosmetics  fragrances  skin care and personal care 
fashion consists of fashion jewelry  watches  apparel  footwear  accessories and children s products 
home consists of gift and decorative products  housewares  entertainment and leisure products and nutritional products 
sales are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by approximately million active independent representatives  who are independent contractors and not our employees 
the success of our business is highly dependent on recruiting  retaining and servicing our representatives 
during  approximately of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations outside the us during  revenues increased  favorably impacted by growth in active representatives 
constant revenues also increased 
acquisitions benefited full year revenue growth by approximately 
sales from products in the beauty category increased  also on a constant basis  due to a increase in units and increase in net per unit 
active representatives increased 
following strong performance during the first half of  revenue growth softened during the second half of the year 
the first half of realized revenue growth of  or on a constant basis  with operating margin expansion of basis points  or basis points improvement on an adjusted non gaap basis  which excludes costs to implement restructuring initiatives and venezuelan special items 
the second half of realized revenue growth of  or on a constant basis  with acquisitions benefiting the growth by 
this slowdown of organic revenue growth pressured operating margins 
revenue growth in the second half of was negatively impacted by a slowdown in two of our largest and most profitable markets  brazil and russia 
brazil s performance in the second half of was primarily driven by service disruptions resulting in shorting of products 
brazil s revenue grew and during the first half and second half of  respectively  with constant revenue growth rates of in the first half and in the second half 
the mid year implementation of government mandated e invoicing exacerbated our legacy order processing systems and capacity which have also been pressured by a significant increase in order scale in recent years 
russia s revenue grew in the first half of  but was flat during the second half  with constant growth rates of in the first half and in the second half 
russia s performance in the second half of was primarily a result of slowing field growth due to weak incentives 
increases in social benefit taxes levied against certain representatives exacerbated the slowdown in field growth 
in russia  weaker color and skincare performance negatively impacted revenue growth in the second half of see the segment review section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information related to changes in revenue by segment 
during  our operating margin was negatively impacted by the devaluation of the venezuelan currency coupled with a required change to account for operations in venezuela on a highly inflationary basis 
as a result of using the historic dollar cost basis of nonmonetary assets  such as inventory  acquired prior to the devaluation  during operating profit was negatively impacted by for the difference between the historical cost at the previous official exchange rate of and the new official exchange rate of 

table of contents in addition to the negative impact to operating margin discussed above  as a result of the devaluation of the venezuelan currency coupled with a required change to account for operations in venezuela on a highly inflationary basis  during the first quarter of we also recorded net charges of in other expense  net and in income taxes  reflecting the write down of monetary assets and liabilities and deferred tax benefits 
see discussion of venezuela within the segment review latin america section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for more information 
we believe that our operating cash flow and global cash and cash equivalent balances of approximately billion  coupled with the continuing execution of our turnaround strategies and the competitive advantages of our direct selling business model  will allow us to continue our focus on long term sustainable  profitable growth 
we are also focused on innovating our direct selling channel through technological and service model enhancements for our representatives and assessing new product category opportunities 
in july  we purchased substantially all the assets and liabilities of silpada  a direct seller of jewelry products  primarily in north america  for aggregate cash consideration of approximately pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we may be required to pay additional consideration in if silpada s north america business achieves specific earnings targets 
in march  we acquired liz earle beauty co 
limited liz earle 
the acquired business is included in our western europe  middle east africa operating segment 
in december  we completed the sale of our subsidiary in japan  which has been reflected as discontinued operations for all periods 
strategic initiatives at the end of  we launched a comprehensive  multi year turnaround plan to restore sustainable growth 
as part of the turnaround plan  we launched our pls and ssi programs 
since  we have identified  and in many cases implemented  restructuring initiatives under our and restructuring programs 
we continue to implement certain initiatives under these restructuring programs 
the anticipated savings or benefits realized from these initiatives has funded and will continue to fund our investment in  amongst other things  advertising  market intelligence  consumer research and product innovation 
whenever we refer to annualized savings or annualized benefits  we mean the additional operating profit we expect to realize on a full year basis every year following implementation of the respective initiative as compared with the operating profit we would have expected to achieve without having implemented the initiative 
advertising and representative value proposition rvp investing in advertising is a key strategy 
we significantly increased spending on advertising over the past four years 
during  our investment in advertising increased by or and as a percentage of beauty sales  our investment in advertising increased by compared to the advertising investments supported new product launches  such as ucr mega impact lipstick  super extend mascara  eternal magic fragrance  outspoken by fergie fragrance  anew platinum night cream and serum  anew luminosity pro serum  and advance technique lotus shield 
advertising investments also included advertising to recruit representatives 
we have also continued to forge alliances with celebrities  including an alliance with fergie for her outspoken fragrance 
we continued to invest in our direct selling channel to improve the reward and effort equation for our representatives 
we have committed significant investments for extensive research to determine the payback on advertising and field tools and actions  and the optimal balance of these tools and actions in our markets 
we have allocated these significant investments in proprietary direct selling analytics to better understand the drivers of value for our representatives 
we measure our investment in rvp as the incremental cost to provide these value enhancing initiatives 
during  we invested approximately incrementally in our representatives through rvp by continued implementation of our sales leadership program  enhanced incentives  increased sales campaign frequency  improved commissions and new e business tools 
investing in rvp will continue to be a key strategy 
we will continue to look for ways to improve the earnings opportunity for representatives through various means  including the following evaluating optimum discount structures in select markets  continuing the roll out of our sales leadership program  which offers representatives an enhanced career opportunity  strategically examining the fee structure and brochure costs to enhance representative economics  recalibrating the frequency of campaigns to maximize representative selling opportunities  service model transformation initiatives  
table of contents applying the optimal balance of advertising and field investment in our key markets  and web enablement for representatives including on line training enhancements 
while the reward and effort will be different within our global portfolio of businesses  we believe that web enablement is a key element to reduce representative effort worldwide 
we will continue to focus on improving internet based tools for our representatives 
product line simplification during  we began to analyze our product line  under our pls program  to develop a smaller range of better performing  more profitable products 
the continued goal of pls is to identify an improved product assortment to drive higher sales of more profitable products 
during  we completed the analysis of our product portfolio  determined the appropriate product assortment going forward and made decisions regarding the ultimate disposition of products that will no longer be part of our improved product assortment such as selling at a discount  donation  or destruction 
sales and marketing benefits have accounted for most of our estimated projected benefits 
improving our product assortment has allowed  and will continue to allow us  to increase exposure and improve presentation of the remaining products within our brochure  which is expected to yield more pleasurable consumer shopping experiences  easier representative selling experiences  and greater sales per brochure page 
a second source of benefits from pls results from transferable demand 
transferable demand refers to the concept that when products with redundant characteristics are removed from our product assortment  some demand from the eliminated products will transfer to the remaining products that offer similar or comparable product characteristics 
as part of pls  when we have identified products that have sufficient overlap of characteristics  we have eliminated the products with the lowest profitability and we expect the products that we retain will generate more profit 
a third source of benefits from pls is less price discounting 
as we have implemented operating procedures under pls  we have introduced fewer new products and lengthened the life cycle of products in our offering 
we expect these operating procedures will lead to less aggressive price discounting over a product s life cycle 
in addition to the benefits above  supply chain benefits accounted for some of our estimated benefits 
we expect improvements to cost of sales once pls is fully implemented  primarily from a reduction in inventory obsolescence expense as a result of better managed inventory levels  lower variable spending on warehousing  more efficient manufacturing utilization and lower purchasing costs 
we also expect operating expenses to benefit from a reduction in distribution costs and benefits to inventory productivity 
given the nature of these benefits  we estimate that we realized our targeted total benefits from this program of approximately during  during and approximately in  or incremental benefits of approximately over strategic sourcing initiative we launched ssi in we believe this initiative has reduced direct and indirect costs of materials  goods and services 
under this initiative  we have shifted our purchasing strategy from a local  commodity oriented approach towards a globally coordinated effort which leverages our volumes  allows our suppliers to benefit from economies of scale  utilizes sourcing best practices and processes  and better matches our suppliers capabilities with our needs 
beyond lower costs  our goals from ssi include improving asset management  service for representatives and vendor relationships 
during  we realized benefits of approximately from ssi 
during  we realized approximately of benefits from ssi  or incremental benefits of approximately over during  we realized approximately of benefits from ssi  or incremental benefits of approximately over the benefits realized in we continue to implement a sales and operations planning process that is intended to better align demand plans with our supply capabilities and provide us with earlier visibility to any potential supply issues 
enterprise resource planning system we are in the midst of a multi year global roll out of an enterprise resource planning erp system  which is expected to improve the efficiency of our supply chain and financial transaction processes 
we began our gradual global roll out in europe in and have since implemented erp in our european manufacturing facilities  our larger european direct selling operations and in the us as part of this continuing global roll out  we expect to implement erp in other countries over the next several years leveraging the knowledge gained from our previous implementations 

table of contents during  we worked to improve the effectiveness of erp in the us and began to implement in the other markets within north america  as well as in some smaller european direct selling operations 
in latin america  we plan to implement modules of erp in a gradual manner across key markets over the next several years 
zero overhead growth we have institutionalized a zero overhead growth philosophy that aims to offset inflation through productivity improvements 
these improvements in productivity will come primarily from ssi and our restructuring initiatives 
we have defined overhead as fixed expenses such as costs associated with our sales and marketing infrastructure  and management and administrative activities 
overhead excludes variable expenses within selling  general and administrative expenses  such as shipping and handling costs and bonuses to our employees in the sales organization  and also excludes consumer and strategic investments that are included in selling  general and administrative expenses  such as advertising  rvp  research and development and brochure costs 
restructuring initiatives restructuring program we launched our original restructuring program under our multi year turnaround plan in late we have approved and announced all of the initiatives that are part of the restructuring program 
we expect to record total restructuring charges and other costs to implement restructuring initiatives under this program of approximately before taxes 
through december   we have recorded total costs to implement  net of adjustments  of in  in  in  in  in and in for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives under the restructuring program  primarily for employee related costs  including severance  pension and other termination benefits  and professional service fees related to these initiatives 
the costs to implement restructuring initiatives during through are associated with specific actions  including organization realignment and downsizing in each region and global through a process called delayering  taking out layers to bring senior management closer to operations  the phased outsourcing of certain services  including certain finance  information technology  human resource and customer service processes  and the move of certain services from markets to lower cost shared service centers  the restructure of certain international direct selling operations  the realignment of certain distribution and manufacturing operations  including the realignment of certain of our north america and latin america distribution operations  the automation of certain distribution processes  the exit of certain unprofitable operations and product lines  and the reorganization of certain functions  primarily sales related organizations 
actions implemented under these restructuring initiatives resulted in savings of approximately in  in  and in we expect to achieve annualized savings of approximately once all initiatives are fully implemented by restructuring program in february  we announced a new restructuring program under our multi year turnaround plan 
we have approved and announced all of the initiatives that are of the restructuring program 
the restructuring initiatives under the restructuring program focus on restructuring our global supply chain operations  realigning certain local business support functions to a more regional basis to drive increased efficiencies  streamlining transaction related services  including selective outsourcing  and reorganizing certain other functions 
we expect to record total restructuring charges and other costs to implement these restructuring initiatives in the range of approximately to before taxes under the restructuring program 
through december   we have recorded total costs to implement  net of adjustments  of in  and in for actions associated with our restructuring initiatives  primarily for employee related costs  including severance  pension and other termination benefits  and professional service fees related to these initiatives 
actions implemented under these restructuring initiatives resulted in savings of approximately in we achieved savings of approximately in we are targeting annualized savings under the restructuring program of approximately upon full implementation by see note  restructuring initiatives  on pages f through f of our annual report 

table of contents on an overall basis  we estimate that we have realized approximately of benefits from pls and ssi and of savings from our two restructuring programs since the inception of our multi year turnaround plan in these savings have been offset by approximately of investments in advertising and rvp 
new accounting standards information relating to new accounting standards is included in note  new accounting standards  of our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report 
key performance indicators within this md a  we utilize the key performance indicators kpis defined below to assist in the evaluation of our business 
kpi definition growth in active representatives this indicator is based on the number of representatives submitting an order in a campaign  totaled for all campaigns in the related period 
this amount is divided by the number of billing days in the related period  to exclude the impact of year to year changes in billing days for example  holiday schedules 
to determine the growth in active representatives  this calculation is compared to the same calculation in the corresponding period of the prior year 
change in units this indicator is based on the gross number of pieces of merchandise sold during a period  as compared to the same number in the same period of the prior year 
units sold include samples sold and product contingent upon the purchase of another product for example  gift with purchase or purchase with purchase  but exclude free samples 
inventory days this indicator is equal to the number of days of cost of sales  based on the average of the preceding months  covered by the inventory balance at the end of the period 
non gaap financial measures to supplement our financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  we disclose operating results that have been adjusted to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars 
we refer to these adjusted growth rates as constant growth  which is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe this measure provides investors an additional perspective on trends 
to exclude the impact of changes due to the translation of foreign currencies into us dollars  we calculate current year results and prior year results at a constant exchange rate 
currency impact is determined as the difference between actual growth rates and constant currency growth rates 
we present gross margin  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue  operating profit  operating margin and effective tax rate on a non gaap basis 
the discussion of our segments presents operating profit and operating margin on a non gaap basis 
we have provided a quantitative reconciliation of the difference between the non gaap financial measure and the financial measure calculated and reported in accordance with gaap 
these non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for  or superior to  financial measures calculated in accordance with gaap 
the company uses the non gaap financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and believes that it is meaningful for investors to be made aware of  on a period to period basis  the impacts of costs to implement cti restructuring initiatives and costs and charges related to venezuela being designated as a highly inflationary economy and the subsequent devaluation of its currency in january venezuelan special items 
the venezuelan special items include the impact on the statement of income caused by the devaluation of the venezuelan currency on monetary assets and liabilities  such as cash  receivables and payables  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and nonmonetary assets  such as inventory and prepaid expenses 
for nonmonetary assets  the venezuelan special items include the earnings impact caused by the difference between the historical cost of the assets at the previous official exchange rate of and the revised official exchange rate of 

table of contents critical accounting estimates we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
see note  description of the business and summary of significant accounting policies  of our consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report for a detailed discussion of the application of these and other accounting policies 
restructuring reserves we record severance related expenses once they are both probable and estimable for severance provided under an ongoing benefit arrangement 
one time  involuntary benefit arrangements and disposal costs  primarily contract termination costs  are recorded when the benefits have been communicated to employees 
one time  voluntary benefit arrangements are recorded when the employee accepts the offered benefit arrangement 
we evaluate impairment issues if the carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset 
we estimate the expense for our restructuring initiatives  when approved by the appropriate corporate authority  by accumulating detailed estimates of costs for such plans 
these expenses include the estimated costs of employee severance and related benefits  impairment of property  plant and equipment  contract termination payments for leases  and any other qualifying exit costs 
these estimated costs are grouped by specific projects within the overall plan and are then monitored on a quarterly basis by finance personnel 
such costs represent our best estimate  but require assumptions about the programs that may change over time  including attrition rates 
estimates are evaluated periodically to determine if an adjustment is required 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable representatives contact their customers  selling primarily through the use of brochures for each sales campaign 
sales campaigns are generally for a two week duration in the us and a two to four week duration outside the us the representative purchases products directly from us and may or may not sell them to an end user 
in general  the representative  an independent contractor  remits a payment to us each sales campaign  which relates to the prior campaign cycle 
the representative is generally precluded from submitting an order for the current sales campaign until the accounts receivable balance for the prior campaign is paid  however  there are circumstances where the representative fails to make the required payment 
we record an estimate of an allowance for doubtful accounts on receivable balances based on an analysis of historical data and current circumstances  including selling schedules  business operations  seasonality and changing trends 
over the past three years  annual bad debt expense has been in the range of to  or approximately of total revenue 
bad debt expense  as a percent of revenue decreased by 
points in as compared to due to improved collection efforts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed for adequacy  at a minimum  on a quarterly basis 
we generally have no detailed information concerning  or any communication with  any end user of our products beyond the representative 
we have no legal recourse against the end user for the collectability of any accounts receivable balances due from the representative to us 
if the financial condition of our representatives were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
allowances for sales returns we record a provision for estimated sales returns based on historical experience with product returns 
over the past three years  sales returns have been in the range of to  or approximately of total revenue 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not approximate future returns  due to changes in marketing or promotional strategies  or for other reasons  additional allowances may be required 
provisions for inventory obsolescence we record an allowance for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value 
in determining the allowance for estimated obsolescence  we classify inventory into various categories based upon its stage in the product life cycle  future marketing sales plans and the disposition process 
we assign a degree of obsolescence risk to products based on this classification to determine the level of obsolescence provision 
if actual sales are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory allowances may need to be recorded for such additional obsolescence 
annual obsolescence expense was for  for  and for obsolescence expense for benefited by approximately from changes in estimates to our disposition plan under our pls program 
pension  postretirement and postemployment expense we maintain defined benefit pension plans  which cover substantially all employees in the us and a portion of employees in international locations 
additionally  we have unfunded supplemental pension benefit plans for some current and retired executives and provide retiree health care and life insurance benefits subject to certain limitations to the majority of employees in the us and in some foreign countries 
see note  employee benefit plans  to our annual report for further information on our benefit plans 

table of contents pension plan expense and the requirements for funding our major pension plans are determined based on a number of actuarial assumptions 
these assumptions include the expected rate of return on pension plan assets  the interest crediting rate for hybrid plans and the discount rate applied to pension plan obligations 
for  the weighted average assumed rate of return on all pension plan assets  including the us and us plans was  compared to for in determining the long term rates of return  we consider the nature of the plans investments  an expectation for the plans investment strategies  historical rates of return and current economic forecasts 
we evaluate the expected long term rate of return annually and adjust as necessary 
the majority of our pension plan assets relate to the us pension plan 
the assumed rate of return for for the us plan was  which was based on an asset allocation of approximately in corporate and government bonds and mortgage backed securities which are expected to earn approximately to in the long term and in equity securities and high yield securities which are expected to earn approximately to in the long term 
historical rates of return on the assets of the us plan was for the most recent year period and for the year period 
in the us plan  our asset allocation policy has favored us equity securities  which have returned over the year period and over the year period 
the plan assets in the us returned in and in recently issued regulations under the pension protection act of require that hybrid plans limit the maximum interest crediting rate to one among several choices of crediting rates which are considered market rates of return 
the rate chosen will affect total pension obligations 
the discount rate used for determining future pension obligations for each individual plan is based on a review of long term bonds that receive a high quality rating from a recognized rating agency 
the discount rates for our more significant plans  including our us plan  were based on the internal rates of return for a portfolio of high quality bonds with maturities that are consistent with the projected future benefit payment obligations of each plan 
the weighted average discount rate for us and us plans determined on this basis was at december   and at december  for the determination of the expected rate of return on assets and the discount rate  we take into consideration external actuarial advice 
our funding requirements may be impacted by regulations or interpretations thereof 
our calculations of pension  postretirement and postemployment costs are dependent on the use of assumptions  including discount rates  hybrid plan maximum interest crediting rates and expected return on plan assets discussed above  rate of compensation increase of plan participants  interest cost  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  mortality rates  the number of associate retirements  the number of associates electing to take lump sum payments and other factors 
actual results that differ from assumptions are accumulated and amortized to expense over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense in future periods 
at december   we had pretax actuarial losses and prior service credits totaling for the us plans and for the non us plans that have not yet been charged to expense 
these actuarial losses have been charged to accumulated other comprehensive loss within shareholders equity 
while we believe that the assumptions used are reasonable  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our pension  postretirement and postemployment obligations and future expense 
during  the plan assets experienced significant losses  which were mostly due to unfavorable returns on equity securities 
these unfavorable returns will increase pension cost in future periods 
for  our assumption for the expected rate of return on assets is for our us plans and for our non us plans 
our assumptions are reviewed and determined on an annual basis 
a basis point change in either direction in the expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate or the rate of compensation increases  would have had approximately the following effect on pension expense increase decrease in pension expense basis point increase decrease rate of return on assets discount rate rate of compensation increase taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize a net deferred tax asset in the future  in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase earnings in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to 
table of contents realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would decrease earnings in the period such determination was made 
deferred taxes are not provided on the portion of unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the us when we conclude that these earnings are indefinitely reinvested 
deferred taxes are provided on earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable  there remain some positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these additional accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
we file income tax returns in many jurisdictions 
in  a number of open tax years are scheduled to close due to the expiration of the statute of limitations and it is possible that a number of tax examinations may be completed 
if our filing positions are ultimately upheld  it is possible that the provision for income taxes may reflect adjustments we recognize the benefit of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
we believe that our assessment of more likely than not is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation stock options issued to employees are recognized in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values using an option pricing model at the date of grant 
we use a black scholes merton option pricing model to calculate the fair value of options 
this model requires various judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation may differ materially in the future from historical results 
loss contingencies we determine whether to disclose and accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable 
our assessment is developed in consultation with our outside counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and can involve matters that are in litigation  which  by its nature is unpredictable 
we believe that our assessment of the probability of loss contingencies is reasonable  but because of the subjectivity involved and the unpredictable nature of the subject matter at issue  our assessment may prove ultimately to be incorrect  which could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other identified intangible assets we test goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually  and more frequently if circumstances warrant  using fair value methods 
we review identified intangible assets with defined useful lives and subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
we completed annual goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles impairment assessments and no adjustments were necessary for the years ended december   or additionally  no events or changes in circumstances occurred that indicated that our intangible assets with defined useful lives may not be recoverable during the years ended december   or the asset impairment analyses performed for goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles require several estimates including future cash flows  growth rates and the selection of discount rates 
for our annual goodwill impairment test  the estimated fair value substantially exceeded the carrying values of each of our reporting units  with the exception of silpada where the estimated fair value was similar to the carrying value  since this reporting unit was only recently acquired 
see note  goodwill and intangible assets  to our annual report for further information 
a significant decline in expected future cash flows and growth rates or a change in the discount rate used to fair value expected future cash flows may result in a goodwill impairment charge

constant revenue during benefited from continued growth in most markets  particularly from growth of in brazil  in mexico and in venezuela 
constant revenue growth in mexico during  was driven by an increase in active representatives  as well as an increase in average order 
constant revenue growth for  in venezuela reflected a higher average order primarily due to increased prices  partially as a result of inflation  and growth in active representatives 
constant revenue growth during in brazil was primarily driven by an increase in active representatives 
constant revenue growth in in brazil was pressured by service disruptions in the second half of the year and a decline in skin care sales 
brazil s revenue grew and during the first half and second half of  respectively  with constant growth rates of in the first half and in the second half 
brazil s performance in the second half of was primarily driven by service disruptions resulting in shorting of products 
the mid year implementation of government mandated e invoicing exacerbated our legacy order processing systems and capacity which have also been pressured by a significant increase in order scale in recent years as brazil s growth during this period outpaced our expectations and our planned infrastructure investments 
these factors pressured the capacity of our legacy systems and were the primary cause of the service disruptions 
operating margin declined during in latin america due to the negative impact of the devaluation of the venezuelan currency in conjunction with highly inflationary accounting as discussed further below 
the decline in operating margin during caused by the venezuelan special items was partially offset by benefits of 
points from lower cti restructuring 
on an adjusted non gaap basis  excluding the venezuelan special items and cti restructuring  the decrease in operating margin in was primarily driven by higher distribution costs  increased investment in rvp and advertising  partially offset by the benefit of favorable foreign exchange 
effective january   we began to account for venezuela as a highly inflationary economy 
effective january   the venezuelan government devalued its currency and moved to a two tier exchange structure 
the official exchange rate moved from to for essential goods and to for nonessential goods and services 
effective december   the venezuelan government eliminated the rate which had been available for the import of essential goods 
substantially all of the imports of our subsidiary in venezuela avon venezuela falls into the nonessential classification 
as a result of the change in the nonessentials official rate to in conjunction with accounting for our operations in venezuela under highly inflationary accounting guidelines  during the first quarter of  we recorded net charges of in other expense  net and in income taxes  for a total after tax charge of  reflecting the write down of monetary assets and liabilities and deferred tax benefits 
additionally  certain nonmonetary assets must continue to be carried at us historic dollar cost subsequent to the devaluation 
therefore  the historic us dollar costs impacted the income statement during at a disproportionate rate as they had not been devalued based on the new exchange rates 
as a result of using the u 
s 
historic dollar cost basis of nonmonetary assets  such as inventory  acquired prior to the devaluation  operating profit during was negatively impacted by  for the 
table of contents difference between the historical cost at the previous official exchange rate of and the current official exchange rate of 
assuming no further devaluations  in  the impact on operating profit of the venezuelan currency devaluations will be immaterial 
currency restrictions enacted by the venezuelan government in have impacted the ability of avon venezuela to obtain foreign currency at the official rate to pay for imported products 
since  avon venezuela had been obtaining their foreign currency needs beyond the amounts that could be obtained at official rates through non government sources where the exchange rates were less favorable than the official rate parallel market 
in late may  the venezuelan government took control over the previously freely traded parallel market 
trading in the parallel market was suspended for several weeks in may and june and reopened as a regulated sitme market in early june the government has imposed volume restrictions on trading activity  limiting an entity s activity to a maximum of per month 
the current limit is below the monthly foreign exchange requirements of our venezuelan operations and  unless these restrictions are modified  may have a negative impact on avon venezuela s future operations 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to recover the higher cost of obtaining foreign currency in the sitme market as compared to the official rate through operating activities  such as increased pricing or cost reductions in other areas

to illustrate our sensitivity to potential future changes in the nonessentials official exchange rate in venezuela  if the nonessentials official exchange rate was further devalued as of december   to a rate of bol vares to the us dollar  which was approximately the rate on december   in the sitme market  or an approximate devaluation  our results would be negatively impacted as follows as a result of the use of a further devalued exchange rate for the remeasurement of avon venezuela s revenues and profits  avon s annualized consolidated revenues would likely be negatively impacted by approximately and annualized consolidated operating profit would likely be negatively impacted by approximately prospectively  assuming no operational improvements occurred to offset the negative impact of a further devaluation 
avon s consolidated operating profit during the first twelve months following the devaluation in this example would likely be negatively impacted by approximately  assuming no offsetting operational improvements 
the larger negative impact on operating profit during the first twelve months as compared to the prospective impact is caused by costs of nonmonetary assets being carried at historic dollar cost in accordance with the requirement to account for venezuela as a highly inflationary economy while revenue would be remeasured at the further devalued rate 
we would likely incur an immediate charge of approximately in other expenses  net and in income taxes associated with the of bol var denominated monetary net assets and deferred income taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the overall objective of our financial risk management program is to reduce the potential negative effects from changes in foreign exchange and interest rates arising from our business activities 
we may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments and through operational means 
since we use foreign currency rate sensitive and interest rate sensitive instruments to hedge a portion of our existing and forecasted transactions  we expect that any loss in value for the hedge instruments generally would be offset by changes in the value of the underlying transactions 

table of contents we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we a party to leveraged derivatives 
the master agreements governing our derivative contracts generally contain standard provisions that could trigger early termination of the contracts in some circumstances  including if we were to merge with another entity and the creditworthiness of the surviving entity were to be materially weaker than that of avon prior to the merger 
interest rate risk we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest rate exposure 
the interest rate swaps are used to either convert our fixed rate borrowing to a variable interest rate or to unwind an existing variable interest rate swap on a fixed rate borrowing 
at december   we held interest rate swap agreements that effectively converted approximately of our outstanding long term  fixed rate borrowings to a variable interest rate based on libor  as compared to at december  our total exposure to floating interest rates was at december   and at december  our long term borrowings and interest rate swaps were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
based on the outstanding balance of all these financial instruments at december   a hypothetical basis point change either an increase or a decrease in interest rates prevailing at that date  sustained for one year  would not represent a material potential change in fair value  earnings or cash flows 
this potential change was calculated based on discounted cash flow analyses using interest rates comparable to our current cost of debt 
foreign currency risk we operate globally  with operations in various locations around the world 
over the past three years  approximately of our consolidated revenue was derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the us the functional currency for most of our foreign operations is the local currency 
we are exposed to changes in financial market conditions in the normal course of our operations  primarily due to international businesses and transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the use of various financial instruments to fund ongoing activities 
at december   the primary currencies for which we had net underlying foreign currency exchange rate exposures were the argentine peso  brazilian real  british pound  canadian dollar  chinese renminbi  colombian peso  the euro  mexican peso  philippine peso  polish zloty  russian ruble  turkish lira  ukrainian hryvnia and venezuelan bol var 
we may reduce our exposure to fluctuations in cash flows associated with changes in foreign exchange rates by creating offsetting positions through the use of derivative financial instruments 
our hedges of our foreign currency exposure are not designed to  and  therefore  cannot entirely eliminate the effect of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our foreign currency financial instruments were analyzed at year end to determine their sensitivity to foreign exchange rate changes 
based on our foreign exchange contracts at december   the impact of a hypothetical appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against our foreign exchange contracts would not represent a material potential change in fair value  earnings or cash flows 
this potential change does not consider our underlying foreign currency exposures 
the hypothetical impact was calculated on the open positions using forward rates at december   adjusted for an assumed appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against these hedging contracts 
credit risk of financial instruments we attempt to minimize our credit exposure to counterparties by entering into derivative transactions and similar agreements with major international financial institutions with a or higher credit ratings as issued by standard poor s corporation 
our foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are comprised of over the counter forward contracts  swaps or options with major international financial institutions 
although our theoretical credit risk is the replacement cost at the then estimated fair value of these instruments  we believe that the risk of incurring credit risk losses is remote and that such losses  if any  would not be material 
non performance of the counterparties on the balance of all the foreign exchange and interest rate agreements would result in a write off of at december  in addition  in the event of non performance by such counterparties  we would be exposed to market risk on the underlying items being hedged as a result of changes in foreign exchange and interest rates
