significant financial and operational highlights the company s operating strategy is to provide quality senior living communities and services to its residents  while achieving and sustaining a strong  competitive position within its chosen markets  as well as to continue to enhance the performance of its operations 
the company provides senior living services to the elderly  including independent living  assisted living  skilled nursing and home care services 
many of the company s communities offer a continuum of care to meet its residents needs as they change over time 
this continuum of care  which integrates independent living and assisted living and is bridged by home care through independent home care agencies or the company s home care agency  sustains residents autonomy and independence based on their physical and mental abilities 
the company primarily derives its revenue by providing senior living and healthcare services to the elderly and operating senior living communities under joint venture arrangements 
despite challenging economic conditions  when comparing fiscal to fiscal the company was able to increase total revenues approximately million  or  of which approximately of these revenues consisted of senior living and healthcare services compared to in fiscal in april  the company and ge healthcare sold its respective ownership interests in midwest i and ii to hcn in sale leaseback transactions of eight senior living communities owned by subsidiaries of midwest i and ii 
upon closing the sales  the company leased the senior housing communities from hcn 
as a result of these sale leaseback transactions  the company received cash proceeds of approximately million  net of closing costs  resulting in gains to the company of approximately million  which have been deferred and are being recognized in the company s statement of income as a reduction in facility lease expense over the initial year lease term 
in september  the company acquired the leasehold interests in communities and certain related personal property from signature assisted living of texas  llc the signature transaction 
simultaneously with closing the signature transaction  the company executed a master lease agreement with affiliates of hcn for the communities the master lease agreement 
the master lease agreement has a term of fifteen years with one year renewal option beyond the initial lease term 
the initial lease rate is and is subject to certain conditional escalation clauses 
the master lease agreement is a triple net lease pursuant to which the company pays all expenses of the properties except principal and interest on any mortgage debt of the properties 
the master 
table of contents lease agreement contains customary representations and warranties as well as affirmative and negative covenants and the lease payments are guaranteed by other subsidiaries of the company 
during  the company was able to decrease general and administrative expenses when compared to fiscal these reductions were primarily the result of the company s ability to leverage resources and identify areas where overhead could be reduced without compromising superior levels of service and care to our residents 
during  the company extinguished million of its outstanding debt obligations  which included a pay off settlement with a lehman securitized trust for a promissory note of one of the company s wholly owned subsidiaries 
the securitized promissory note carried an outstanding principal balance of million which was collateralized with the assets of the subsidiary and was nonrecourse to the company 
the pay off settlement was for million  excluding amounts reserved and escrowed  with no further obligation to the company s subsidiary and resulted in a gain to the company of approximately million 
these principal reductions further reduced the company s exposure to the volatility in the credit markets and enabled the company to reduce interest expense by approximately million  or  during fiscal when compared to fiscal the senior living industry continues to be negatively impacted by unfavorable conditions in the housing  credit and financial markets and the overall economy  generally resulting in lower than anticipated occupancy rates 
throughout fiscal  in response to these conditions  the company has continued to focus on maintaining an emphasis on occupancy increases  improvement in rental rates  expense management and growth in net operating income per unit  conversions of existing units to higher levels of care  and other opportunities to enhance cash flow and shareholder value

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the 
table of contents accompanying financial statements and related notes 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical experience  observance of industry trends and various other sources of information and factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and potentially could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition resident and health care revenue is recognized at estimated net realizable amounts  based on historical experiences  due from residents in the period to which the rental and other services are provided 
revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs accounted for approximately of the company s revenue in fiscal and of the company s revenue in each of fiscal and seventeen of the company s communities are providers of services under medicaid programs 
accordingly  the communities are entitled to reimbursement under the foregoing program at established rates that are lower than private pay rates 
patient service revenue for medicaid patients is recorded at the reimbursement rates as the rates are set prospectively by the state upon the filing of an annual cost report 
two of the company s communities are providers of services under the medicare program and are entitled to payment under the foregoing programs in amounts determined based on rates established by the federal government 
laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to interpretation 
the company believes that it is in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing 
while no such regulatory inquiries have been made  compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines  penalties  and exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs 
management services revenue is recognized when earned 
management services revenue relates to providing certain management and administrative support services under management contracts  which currently have terms expiring through substantially all community fees received from residents are non refundable and are recorded initially by the company as deferred revenue 
the deferred amounts are amortized over the respective residents initial lease term which is consistent with the contractual obligation associated with the estimated stay of the resident 
community reimbursement revenue is comprised of reimbursable expenses from non consolidated communities that the company operates under long term management agreements 
investments in joint ventures the company accounts for its investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting 
the company was the general partner in two partnerships and owns member interests in seven other joint ventures 
the company has not consolidated these joint venture interests because the company has concluded that the limited partners or the other members of each joint venture has substantive kick out rights or substantive participating rights 
under the equity method of accounting  the company records its investments in joint ventures at cost and adjusts such investments for its share of earnings and losses of the joint venture 
development agreement guarantees in  the company and shpiii entered into a series of joint venture agreements to develop three senior housing communities located in ohio 
the company has guaranteed the communities will be completed and operated at budgeted costs approved by the joint venture members 
these costs include the hard and soft construction costs and operating costs until each community reaches breakeven 
the budgeted costs include contingency reserves for potential cost overruns and other unforeseen costs 
the terms of these guarantees generally do not provide for a limitation on the maximum potential future payments 
these joint venture communities are 
table of contents currently in lease up and one of the joint ventures had exhausted its lease up reserve under the existing loan commitment 
the company will be required to fund any operating deficits until the joint venture reaches breakeven for three consecutive months 
any amounts funded by the company under this commitment  up to million  may be recoverable from the joint venture in the event of liquidation 
as of december   the company had recognized deficit charges of approximately million under these development agreement guarantees 
the company does not currently anticipate funding any deficits in excess of the amounts estimated to be recoverable from the joint ventures 
assets held for sale assets are classified as held for sale when the company has committed to selling the asset and believes that it will be disposed of within one year 
the company determines the fair value  net of costs of disposal  of an asset on the date the asset is categorized as held for sale  and the asset is recorded at the lower of its fair value  net of cost of disposal  or carrying value on that date 
the company periodically reevaluates assets held for sale to determine if the assets are still recorded at the lower of fair value  net of cost of disposal  or carrying value 
the company has one parcel of land classified as held for sale at december  the fair value of this property is generally determined based on market rates  industry trends and recent comparable sales transactions 
the actual sales price of this asset could differ significantly from the company s estimate 
lease accounting the company determines whether to account for its leases as either operating  capital or financing leases depending on the underlying terms of each lease agreement 
this determination of classification is complex and requires significant judgment relating to certain information including the estimated fair value and remaining economic life of the community  the company s cost of funds  minimum lease payments and other lease terms 
as of december   the company leased communities and classified each of the leases as an operating lease 
the company incurs lease acquisition costs and amortizes these costs over the term of the lease agreement 
certain leases entered into by the company qualified as sale leaseback transactions and as such any related gains have been deferred and are being amortized over the lease term 
facility lease expense in the company s statement of income includes rent expense plus amortization expense relating to leasehold acquisition costs offset by the amortization of deferred gains and lease incentives 
long lived assets property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are to years for buildings and building improvements  to years for leasehold improvements  to years for land improvements and to years for furniture  equipment and automobiles 
at each balance sheet date  the company reviews the carrying value of its property and equipment to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that they may be impaired or that the depreciation period may need to be changed 
the company considers internal factors such as net operating losses along with external factors relating to each asset  including contract changes  local market developments  and other publicly available information 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flows from such asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair market value  generally based on discounted cash flows  of the long lived asset 
the company analyzed certain long lived assets with operating losses  under the undiscounted cash flow method  for impairment 
the company does not believe there are any material indicators that would require  and the cash flow analysis did not require  an adjustment to the carrying value of the property and equipment or their remaining useful lives as of december  and 
table of contents income taxes at december   the company had recorded on its consolidated balance sheet deferred tax assets of approximately million 
deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
management regularly evaluates the future realization of deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance  if considered necessary  based on such evaluation 
the company has evaluated future expectations of net income and various tax planning strategies that it believes are both prudent and feasible  including various strategies to utilize net built in gains on the company s appreciated assets 
however  the benefits of the net deferred tax assets might not be realized if actual results differ from expectations 
the company believes based upon this analysis that the realization of the net deferred tax assets is reasonably assured and therefore has not provided for a valuation allowance 
the company evaluates uncertain tax positions through consideration of accounting and reporting guidance on thresholds  measurement  derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition that is intended to provide better financial statement comparability among different companies 
the company is required to recognize a tax benefit in its financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management s assessment is that its position is more likely than not ie  a greater than percent likelihood to be upheld on audit based only on the technical merits of the tax position 
the company s policy is to recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as interest expense and penalties as income tax expense 
the company is not subject to income tax examinations for tax years prior to recently issued accounting guidance in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standard updates asu  health care entities topic presentation of insurance claims and related insurance recoveries  which clarifies that a health care entity generally remains liable for payment of claims and retains the risk of loss for that claim even if an insurance entity is paying for the defense of the claim and ultimately pays for some or all of the award or settlement 
it was concluded that gross presentation of the claim reflects that the health care entity remains obligated for the claim and that the entity is exposed to credit risk from the insurer until the claim has been resolved 
the guidance provided in this asu is effective for the fiscal years  and interim periods within those years  beginning after december  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
fasb accounting standards codification asc formerly fasb statement no 
 amendments to fasb interpretation no 
r requires an enterprise to perform an analysis to determine whether the enterprise s variable interest or interests give it a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity 
this analysis identifies the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity as the enterprise that has both the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impact the entity s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the variable interest entity 
this guidance also requires ongoing reassessments of whether an enterprise is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and was effective for the company on january  the adoption did not have an impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows
