item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes beginning on page f in addition to historical information  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should read item a 
risk factors for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
our fiscal year ends on june  and references to a specific fiscal year are the twelve months ended june of such year for example  fiscal refers to the year ended june  
business overview we are a leading global provider of mission critical process optimization software solutions  which are designed to manage and optimize plant and process design  operational performance  and supply chain planning 
our aspenone software and related services have been developed specifically for companies in the process industries 
customers use our solutions to improve their competitiveness and profitability by increasing throughput and productivity  reducing operating costs  enhancing capital efficiency  and decreasing working capital requirements 
we have more than  customers globally 
our customers include manufacturers in process industries such as energy  chemicals  pharmaceuticals  consumer packaged goods  power  metals and mining  pulp and paper  and biofuels  as well as engineering and construction firms that help design and build process manufacturing plants 
as of june   our installed base included of the largest petroleum companies  all of the largest chemical companies  and of the largest pharmaceutical companies 
customers outside the united states accounted for a majority of our total revenue in each of fiscal  and  and no single customer represented or more of our total revenue in fiscal  or transition to the aspenone subscription offering in fiscal  we began offering our aspenone software under a subscription based licensing model  under which a customer can access all products within a licensed suite aspenone engineering or aspenone manufacturing and supply chain 
during the license term  a customer is entitled to receive post contract support  which we refer to as sms  as well as any software products and upgrades introduced into the licensed suite 
revenue is recognized over the term of a license agreement on a subscription  or daily ratable  basis 
we typically issue invoices annually  and we record each invoiced payment as deferred revenue and then recognize revenue from that payment due date over the applicable period 
we also continue to offer our customers the ability to license specifically defined sets of aspenone products  referred to as point products  which in july we began licensing with sms included for the term of the arrangement 
revenue is recognized on these arrangements over the contract term  as payments become due 
prior to fiscal  we offered term or perpetual licenses to specific aspenone products or specifically defined sets of aspenone products  which we refer to as point products 
the majority of our license revenue was recognized under an upfront revenue model  in which the net present value of the aggregate license fees was recognized as revenue upon shipment of the point products 
we typically invoiced customers annually and recorded the net present value of uninvoiced payments as installments receivable 
customers typically received one year of sms bundled with their license agreements and then could elect to renew sms annually 
revenue from sms was recognized ratably over the period which the sms was delivered 

table of contents our aspenone subscription offering has not changed the method or timing of our customer billing or cash collections and our net cash provided by operating activities increased in each of fiscal and the principal accounting implications of the change in our licensing model are as follows the majority of our license revenue is no longer recognized on an upfront basis 
as the result of the transition to our aspenone subscription offering  our license revenue for fiscal and was significantly less than the level achieved in the fiscal years preceding our licensing model change 
we expect that our revenue will continue to increase as customers renew their previous upfront licensing arrangements under our subscription based licensing model 
we do not expect to recognize levels of revenue comparable to prior fiscal years until a significant majority of our existing license agreements have been renewed under our subscription based licensing model 
because the timing of our incurrence of operating costs has not changed  the lower levels of revenue expected over the next few years may result in operating losses 
the amount of our installments receivable will continue to decrease  as license agreements executed under our upfront revenue model reach the end of their terms 
uninvoiced payments are not recorded on our consolidated balance sheet under the subscription based licensing model 
the amount of our deferred revenue will continue to increase over time  as installments for license transactions executed under our aspenone subscription offering are deferred and recognized on a subscription basis 
for additional information about the recognition of revenue under the upfront revenue model and our subscription offering  see revenue 
because of the accounting implications of our aspenone subscription offering  we believe that  for the next several years  a number of performance indicators based on us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  will be of reduced value in assessing our performance  growth and financial condition 
accordingly  we are focusing on a number of other business metrics  including those described under key business metrics 
future impact of enhanced sms offering in july  we released an enhanced sms offering to provide more value to our customers 
as part of this offering  customers receive x support  faster response times and dedicated technical advocates 
the enhanced sms offering is being provided to both i aspenone subscription customers and ii customers who have licensed point products on a term basis with sms included for the term of the arrangement 
we do not have a history of selling this new sms offering to customers on a stand alone basis and cannot establish vendor specific evidence of fair value  or vsoe 
as a result  beginning in july  the revenue associated with point product arrangements that include the enhanced sms offering is being recognized on a daily ratable basis  consistent with the revenue recognition of fees on our aspenone subscription offering arrangements 
beginning in fiscal  the ratable revenue from both aspenone subscription arrangements and point product arrangements with enhanced sms will be presented as subscription and software revenue 
we expect the impact of the loss of vsoe to result in moderately lower revenue in fiscal due to timing 
we currently recognize software revenue on point product arrangements over the contract term when the related installments become due 
however  in fiscal  we are recognizing revenue on a daily ratable basis  beginning when the installment becomes due 
as a result of this change  only a portion of the revenue associated with the installment will be recognized during fiscal the new sms offering did not impact our results of operations or income statement presentation for fiscal   or 
table of contents revenue we generate revenue primarily from the following sources software licenses 
we provide integrated process optimization software solutions designed specifically for the process industries 
we license our software products  together with sms  primarily on a term basis  and we offer extended payment options for our term license agreements that generally require annual payments  which we also refer to as installments 
sms and other 
our sms business consists primarily of providing customer technical support and access to software fixes and upgrades 
we provide customer technical support services throughout the world from our three global call centers as well as via email and through our support website 
our training business provides customers with a variety of training solutions  including on site  internet based and customized training 
professional services 
we offer professional services that include implementing and integrating our technology with customers existing systems in order to improve their plant performance and gain better operational data 
customers who use our professional services typically engage us to provide those services over periods of up to months 
we charge customers for professional services on a time and materials or fixed price basis 
before we can recognize revenue  the following four basic criteria generally must be met persuasive evidence of an arrangement as evidence of the existence of an arrangement  we use a contract signed by the customer for software licenses and sms and we use a signed contract and a statement of work for professional services 
delivery of product software and the corresponding access keys are generally delivered to customers via disk media with standard shipping terms of free carrier  our warehouse 
our software license agreements do not contain conditions for acceptance 
fee is fixed or determinable we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement 
in addition  we assess whether contract modifications to an existing term arrangement constitute a concession 
our software license agreements do not include a right of return or exchange 
collection of fee is probable we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer payment history  its current creditworthiness  economic conditions in the customer industry and geographic location  and general economic conditions 
if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected  provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value for sms and professional services  but not for our software products 
our vsoe determination is based upon the price charged to similarly situated customers when the elements are sold separately 
we allocate the arrangement consideration among the elements included in our multi element arrangements using the residual method 
under the residual method  the vsoe of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee for perpetual and term licenses is recognized as revenue upon delivery of the software  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if vsoe does not exist for an undelivered element in an arrangement  revenue is deferred until such evidence does exist for the undelivered elements  or until all elements are delivered  whichever is earlier 
in july  we released an enhanced sms offering to provide more value to our customers  for which we do not have vsoe 
as a result  beginning in fiscal  we will no longer be able to separate the license and sms components of our point product arrangements under the residual 
table of contents method 
in fiscal and beyond  the revenue associated with point product arrangements bundled with enhanced sms will be recognized on a daily ratable basis  consistent with the revenue recognition of fees on our aspenone subscription offering arrangements 
software license revenue prior to fiscal prior to fiscal  we generally licensed point products pursuant to term or perpetual license agreements with contractual provisions intended to result in the upfront recognition of license revenue upon delivery of the point products  regardless of whether payment was made in period installments or at the outset of the arrangement 
under our upfront revenue model  we typically were able to demonstrate that the license fees were fixed or determinable for all arrangements  including those for term licenses containing extended payment terms  and we had an established history of collecting under the terms of these agreements without providing concessions to customers 
a portion of the license fees generally was recorded as deferred revenue due to the inclusion of an undelivered element  sms  and the amount of revenue allocated to sms was based on the vsoe of fair value for sms using the residual method 
the net present value of the residual license fees typically was recognized upon delivery of the software 
license revenue recognized under the upfront revenue model upon the delivery of the licensed software both term and perpetual license agreements was reported as software revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
fiscal and beyond in july  we began offering our aspenone subscription offering  which provides customers with access to all products within the aspenone suite s they license 
during the term of a license agreement  a customer is entitled to receive sms as well as any software products and upgrades that may be introduced into the licensed suite 
for purposes of recognizing revenue  the license fees under these agreements are not fixed or determinable  because the agreements provide rights to future unspecified software products for no additional fee and therefore the economics of the arrangements are not comparable to our historical transactions with customers under the upfront revenue model 
as a result  the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the amount of customer payments currently due  which generally results in license revenue being recognized over the term of the agreement on a subscription basis  beginning when the first payment is due  which typically is days after execution of the agreement 
for arrangements sold under the aspenone subscription offering  the license and sms components of the arrangement cannot be separated 
as a result  all of the related revenue is reported as subscription revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
we also offer our customers the ability to license point products 
in july we began licensing point products on a term basis with sms included for the full license term 
under these arrangements  license revenue cannot be recognized under the upfront revenue model  as the aggregate fees are not considered fixed or determinable because the agreements include sms for the full term of the license and therefore the economics of the arrangements are not comparable to our historical transactions with customers under the upfront revenue model 
license revenue for these arrangements generally is recognized as payments become due over the term of the agreement 
throughout fiscal and  revenue from point product licenses with sms included for the license term was reported as software revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
the revenue related to the sms component of point product licenses is reported in services and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
beginning in july  the revenue associated with point product arrangements bundled with enhanced sms is recognized on a daily ratable basis  consistent with the revenue recognition of fees 
table of contents on our aspenone subscription offering arrangements 
in fiscal and beyond  the ratable revenue from both aspenone subscription arrangements and point product arrangements with enhanced sms included for the term of the agreement will be presented in the consolidated statements of operations as subscription and software revenue 
we generally do not intend to enter into new or renewal term contracts that will qualify for revenue recognition upfront  upon delivery of the licensed software 
we may  however  do so on a limited basis  as follows the incremental revenue associated with amendments to existing term license agreements that was recognized under the upfront revenue model will continue to be accounted for on an upfront basis  provided all other revenue recognition requirements have been met 
we anticipate that occasionally a customer may wish to license point products on a perpetual basis 
if we agree to enter into a perpetual license agreement  the customer will not be entitled to receive software products that may be introduced and will receive sms for only one year  subject to annual renewal at the election of the customer 
accordingly  we expect that the license fees for perpetual license agreements typically will continue to be recognized upon delivery of the software products using the residual method 
we do not anticipate that any of the foregoing arrangements will generate a significant portion of our revenue in the future 
sms prior to fiscal  sms was typically included with the license agreement for the initial year of the license term and then could be renewed  typically on an annual basis  at the election of the customer 
the fair value of sms was deferred and subsequently recognized over the term of the sms arrangement as services and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
since july  license agreements executed under our aspenone subscription and point product offerings include sms for the full term of the arrangement 
for arrangements sold under the aspenone subscription offering  the license and sms components of the arrangement cannot be separated 
as a result  all of the related revenue is reported as subscription revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
throughout fiscal and  the sms component of point product licenses is reported in services and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
standalone renewal sms on perpetual arrangements is reported as services and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
since we do not have vsoe for our enhanced sms offering  in fiscal and beyond  the sms component of point product arrangements will no longer be separable 
going forward  revenue from point product arrangements with enhanced sms included for the term of the agreement will be presented in the consolidated statements of operations as subscription and software revenue 
professional services we provide professional services on a time and materials or fixed price basis 
we recognize professional services fees for time and materials contracts based upon hours worked and contractually agreed upon hourly rates 
we recognize revenue from fixed price engagements using the proportional performance method  based on the ratio of costs incurred  substantially all of which are labor related  to the total estimated project costs 
project costs are based on standard rates  which vary by the consultant professional level  plus all direct expenses incurred to complete the engagement that are not reimbursed by the client 
project costs are typically expensed as incurred 
reimbursable amounts received from customers for out of pocket expenses are recorded as revenue 

table of contents we generally recognize revenue from professional services as the services are performed  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
revenue from committed professional service arrangements that are sold as a single arrangement with  or in contemplation of  a licensing transaction is deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of a the period the services are performed or b the term of the related software arrangement 
under the upfront model  this typically resulted in professional services revenue being recognized over the period the services were performed 
under the subscription based licensing model  this typically results in professional services revenue being recognized over the term of the related software arrangement 
our typical contract term approximates five years 
revenue recognized with respect to professional services is reported as services and other revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
key components of operations revenue subscription revenue 
subscription revenue relates to the licensing of our products under our aspenone subscription offering  where sms is included for the entire term of the arrangement and the customer receives the right to unspecified future software products that may be introduced during the term of the arrangement for no additional fee 
for arrangements sold under the aspenone subscription offering  the license and sms components of the arrangement cannot be separated 
as a result  all of the related revenue is recognized ratably  and is reported as subscription revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
beginning in fiscal  subscription and software revenue will also include the fees from point product arrangements with sms included for the term of the arrangement  for which we have not established vsoe 
software revenue 
software revenue consists of all license transactions that do not contain rights to future unspecified software products for no additional fee 
specifically  software revenue includes license revenue recognized under the upfront revenue model upon the delivery of the licensed software that is  both perpetual and term license agreements  license revenue recognized over the term of the license agreements for term agreements  including point product licenses with sms included for the license term 
beginning in fiscal  revenue from point product arrangements with sms included for the license term will be recorded as subscription and software  and other license revenue derived from transactions that are being recognized over time as the result of not previously meeting one or more of the requirements for recognition under the upfront revenue model 
services and other revenue 
our services and other revenue consists primarily of revenue related to professional services  sms from point product arrangements and standalone sms renewals excluding sms on our aspenone subscription arrangements and training 
beginning in fiscal  sms revenue will also exclude fees from point product arrangement where we have not established vsoe for the sms deliverable 
the amount and timing of this revenue depend on a number of factors  including whether the professional services arrangement was sold as a single arrangement with  or in contemplation of  a new aspenone licensing transaction  the number  value and rate per hour of service transactions booked during the current and preceding periods  
table of contents the number and availability of service resources actively engaged on billable projects  the timing of milestone acceptance for engagements contractually requiring customer sign off  the timing of negotiating and signing maintenance renewals  the timing of collection of cash payments when collectability is uncertain  and the size of the installed base of license contracts 
cost of revenue cost of subscription and software 
the cost of subscription and software revenue consists of royalties  amortization of capitalized software costs  distribution fees  the costs of providing sms on arrangements where the related revenue is recorded as subscription revenue  and costs related to delivery of software 
cost of services and other 
our cost of services and other revenue consists primarily of personnel related and external consultant costs associated with providing professional services  sms on arrangements not recognized on a subscription basis and training to customers 
operating expenses selling and marketing expense 
selling expenses consist primarily of the personnel and travel expenses related to the effort expended to license our products and services to current and potential customers  as well as for overall management of customer relationships 
marketing expenses include expenses needed to promote our company and our products and to acquire market research and measure customer opinions to help us better understand our customers and their business needs 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses primarily consist of personnel and external consultant expenses related to the creation of new products and to enhancements and engineering changes to existing products 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of corporate and support functions  such as executive leadership and administration groups  finance  legal  human resources and corporate communications  and other costs such as outside professional and consultant fees and provision for bad debts 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges result from the closure or consolidation of our facilities  or from qualifying reductions in headcount 
other income and expenses interest income 
interest income is recorded for the accretion of interest on the installment payments of our term software license contracts when revenue is recognized upfront at net present value  and to a lesser extent from the investment of cash balances in short term instruments 
interest expense 
interest expense consists of charges primarily related to our secured borrowings 
secured borrowings are derived from our borrowing arrangements with unrelated financial institutions 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net is comprised primarily of foreign currency exchange gains losses generated from the settlement and remeasurement of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of our operating units 
we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts to attempt to minimize the adverse impact related to unfavorable exchange rate movements  although we have not done so since fiscal historically  our foreign currency forward contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments and  therefore  do not 
table of contents qualify for fair value or cash flow hedge treatment under the criteria of accounting standards codification  or asc  topic  derivatives and hedging 
therefore  any unrealized gains and losses on the foreign currency forward contracts  as well as the underlying transactions we are attempting to shield from exchange rate movements  would be recognized as a component of other income expense  net 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes is comprised of the taxes currently payable as a result of domestic and foreign operations and the net tax effects of book tax timing differences 
we record interest and penalties related to income tax matters as income tax expense 
we expect the amount of income tax expense  if any  to vary each reporting period depending upon fluctuations in our taxable income and our ability to utilize tax benefits from net loss carry forwards 
key business metrics background with the adoption of our aspenone subscription offering  our revenue for fiscal and was significantly less than in the years preceding our model change 
we expect that our revenue will increase as customers renew their licensing arrangements under our subscription based licensing model 
we do not expect to recognize levels of revenue comparable to prior fiscal years until a significant majority of our existing license agreements has been renewed under our subscription based licensing model 
as a result  we believe that  for the next few years  a number of our performance indicators based on us generally accepted accounting principles or gaap  including revenue  gross profit  operating income loss and net income loss  will be of limited value in assessing our performance  growth and financial condition 
accordingly  we instead are focusing on certain non gaap and other business metrics  including the key metrics set forth below  to track our business performance 
none of these metrics should be considered as an alternative to any measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with gaap 
to supplement our statements of cash flows presented on a gaap basis  we use the non gaap measure of free cash flow to analyze cash flows generated from our operations 
management believes that this financial measure is useful to investors because it permits investors to view our performance using the same tools that management uses to gauge progress in achieving our goals 
we believe this measure is also useful to investors because it is an indication of cash flow that may be available to fund further investments in future growth initiatives and it is also useful as a basis for comparing our performance with that of our competitors 
to supplement our presentation of total cost of revenue and total operating costs presented on a gaap basis  we use a non gaap measure of adjusted total costs  which excludes certain non cash and non recurring expenses 
management believes that this financial measure is useful to investors because it demonstrates the cash operating costs of the business 
the presentation of these non gaap measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity or as an alternative to total cost of revenue and total operating costs as a measure of our total costs 
total term contract value total term contract value  or tcv  is an estimate of the renewal value  as of a specific date  of our active portfolio of term license agreements 
tcv is calculated by multiplying the terminal annual payment for each active term license agreement by the original length of the existing license term  and then aggregating this amount for all active term license agreements 
accordingly  tcv represents the full renewal value of all of our current term license agreements under the hypothetical assumption that all of those agreements are simultaneously renewed for the identical license terms and at the same terminal annual payment amounts 
tcv includes the value of sms for any multi year license agreements for which sms is committed for the entire license term 
tcv does not include any 
table of contents amounts for perpetual licenses  professional services  training or standalone renewal sms 
tcv is calculated using constant currency assumptions for agreements denominated in currencies other than us dollars in order to remove the impact of currency fluctuations between comparison dates 
we also estimate a license only tcv  which we refer to as tlcv  by removing the sms portion of tcv using our historic estimated selling price for sms 
our portfolio of active license agreements currently reflect a mix of a license agreements that include sms for the entire license term and b legacy license agreements that do not include sms 
tlcv provides a consistent basis for assessing growth  particularly while customers are continuing to transition to arrangements that include sms for the term of the arrangement 
we believe tcv and tlcv are useful metrics for analyzing our business performance  particularly while we are transitioning to our aspenone subscription offering and revenue comparisons between fiscal periods do not reflect the actual growth rate of our business 
comparing tcv and tlcv for different dates provides insight into the growth and retention rate of our business during the period between those dates 
tcv and tlcv increase as the result of new term license agreements with new or existing customers  renewals or modifications of existing license agreements that result in higher license fees due to price escalation or an increase in the number of tokens units of software usage or products licensed  and renewals of existing license agreements that increase the length of the license term 
the renewal of an existing license agreement will not increase tcv and tlcv unless the renewal results in higher license fees or a longer license term 
tcv and tlcv are adversely affected by customer non renewals and by renewals that result in lower license fees or a shorter license term 
our standard license term historically has been between five and six years  and we do not expect this standard term to change in the future 
many of our contracts have escalating annual payments throughout the term of the arrangement 
by calculating tcv and tlcv based on the terminal year annual payment  we are typically using the highest annual fee from the existing arrangement to calculate the hypothetical renewal value of our portfolio of term arrangements 
we estimate that tlcv grew by approximately during fiscal from billion at june  to billion at june   principally as the result of an increase in the number of tokens or products licensed 
we estimate that tcv grew during fiscal from billion at june  to billion at june  future cash collections and billings backlog future cash collections is the sum of billings backlog  accounts receivable  undiscounted installments receivable and undiscounted collateralized receivables 
billings backlog represents the aggregate value of uninvoiced bookings from prior and current periods that is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
prior to fiscal  the majority of bookings was recognized as revenue in the period booked and reflected on our balance sheet as installments receivable  or if sold  as collateralized receivables 
installments receivable and collateralized receivables were discounted to net present value at prevailing market rates at the time of the transaction 
amounts collected for collateralized receivables are applied to pay the related secured borrowings and are not available for any other expenditures 
under our aspenone subscription offering and for point product arrangements with sms included for the entire term of the arrangement  extended contractual payments are not considered fixed or 
table of contents determinable and  as a result  are not included in installments receivable or collateralized receivables 
these future payments are included in billings backlog  which is not reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe future cash collections is a useful metric because it provides insight into the cash generation capability of our business 
under the upfront revenue model  we did not previously monitor billings backlog or future cash collections since we believed that accounts receivable  installments receivable  collateralized receivables and certain other measures were appropriate indicators of estimated cash generation at that time 
since a substantial majority of our future bookings will reflect arrangements which include sms for the term of the arrangement  we expect billings backlog to grow over time and expect installments receivable and collateralized receivables to decline 
when all customers have transitioned to arrangements which include sms for the term of the arrangement  future cash collections will include all contractually committed sources of cash associated with our licensing and sms business 
the only sources of cash that will continue to be excluded from future cash collections will be amounts attributable to professional services  training and any remaining standalone sms 
the following table provides our future cash collections as of the dates presented june  dollars in thousands billings backlog accounts receivable  net installments receivable  undiscounted non gaap collateralized receivables  undiscounted non gaap future cash collections excludes unamortized discount 
the growth in billings backlog and future cash collections in fiscal reflected our customers continued adoption of our subscription based licensing model 
we are actively engaged in transitioning customers from perpetual license arrangements to our subscription based licensing model 
prior to fiscal  we licensed our aspenone manufacturing and supply chain suite primarily on a perpetual basis  and as we convert these customers to our subscription based licensing model  their licensing fees and sms will become part of billings backlog and future cash collections 
installments and collateralized receivables are shown at net present value on our consolidated balance sheets 
future cash collections excludes the unamortized discount on installment and collateralized receivables 
amounts collected for collateralized receivables are applied to pay the related secured borrowings and are not available for any other expenditures 
we are providing the following reconciliation for the periods presented to reconcile to undiscounted installment and 
table of contents collateralized receivables  as included in our future cash collections metric  with gaap installment receivables  net and gaap collateralized receivables  net june  dollars in thousands installments receivable  undiscounted non gaap unamortized discount installments receivable  net collateralized receivables  undiscounted non gaap unamortized discount collateralized receivables  net bookings bookings are a measure of the business closed during a period and represent the amount of contractually committed subscription and software fees  including any bundled sms 
bookings do not include a fees for professional services  training or standalone renewal sms or b any amount of subscription and or software fees from pre existing license agreements that were replaced by new arrangements prior to their scheduled expiration date 
the contractual arrangements that contribute to bookings represent binding payment commitments by customers over periods that typically range from five to six years  although individual customer commitments can be for longer or shorter periods 
the following table presents our bookings for fiscal and  following the introduction of our aspenone subscription offering year ended june  period to period change dollars in thousands bookings period over period bookings comparisons may not be particularly meaningful 
the amount of bookings in a period is a function of a the volume  duration and value of contracts renewed during the period and b the amount of bookings that contribute to growth of tcv and tlcv as described above 
contract renewals may occur on or near the expiration date of the existing contract natural renewal  or alternatively  customers may elect to renew their contracts substantially in advance of the expiration date early renewal 
the timing and value of contract renewals has a significant impact on quarter over quarter and year over year comparisons of bookings 
therefore  short term bookings trends are not indicative of the growth of the business 
fiscal and growth and renewal bookings were both strong  demonstrating our customer acceptance of our aspenone subscription model 
because of the limitations of period over period bookings comparisons  we primarily focus on bookings contribution to growth in tcv  tlcv  billings backlog and future cash collections as future indicators of revenue and cash flow growth

in the second quarter of fiscal  we became current with our sec filings and we issued million restricted stock units and million stock options to our directors and employees 
a portion of these awards vested upon issuance 
for additional information about stock based compensation program  see note to our consolidated financial statements  stock based compensation 
fiscal compared to fiscal the most significant components of the period over period decrease in adjusted total costs were decreased professional services costs excluding stock based compensation expenses of million  reduced finance related consultant and audit fees of million  and lower royalty expense 
these expense decreases were partially offset by increased legal and related expenses of million 
legal expenses in the period primarily relate to the atme matter and proceedings we have instituted to enforce our intellectual property rights 
please refer to part i  item  legal proceedings  for more information on specific matters 
legal expenses for fiscal also include expenses related to the secondary offering of our common stock  which was effective as of september  for additional information on the comparison of fiscal to expenses  see results of operations 
fiscal compared to fiscal the most significant components of the period over period decrease in adjusted total costs were lower expenses for finance related consultant and audit fees of million  royalties of million  payroll and benefits of million  and third party commissions of million 
these expense decreases were partially offset by increased expenses for sales commissions of million  legal and 
table of contents related expenses of million and bonuses of million 
during fiscal we met all of our bonus criteria and accrued of our bonus plan  as compared to in fiscal free cash flow free cash flow is calculated as net cash provided by operating activities less the sum of a purchase of property  equipment  and leasehold improvements and b capitalized computer software development costs 
customer collections and  consequently  cash flow from operating activities and free cash flow are primarily driven by license and services billings  rather than recognized revenue 
as a result  the transition to our aspenone subscription offering has not had an adverse impact on cash receipts 
until existing license contracts are renewed and license related revenue returns to prior year levels  we believe free cash flow is a more relevant measure of our financial performance than income statement profitability measures such as total revenue  gross profit  operating profit and net income 
additionally  we also believe that free cash flow is often used by security analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of software companies 
the following table provides a reconciliation of net cash flow to free cash flow provided by operating activities for the periods presented year ended june  dollars in thousands net cash provided by operating activities purchase of property  equipment and leasehold improvements capitalized computer software development costs free cash flow non gaap we believe we will continue to realize improved free cash flow as we benefit from the continued growth of our portfolio of term license contracts  combined with continued focus on cost management and as customers continue to renew contracts that were previously paid upfront 
as part of our historical contract arrangements  customers could elect to pay for their term licenses upfront rather than over the contract term 
the upfront payment would normally be equal to the net present value of the annual cash payments  typically discounted at an rate 
prior period practices of upfront payments resulted in increased cash flow variability  both in the period of the payment  and the subsequent years of the contract term 
we have moved away from upfront payments in recent years  and as a result  we expect cash flows to continue to normalize over the next several years

the increase in subscription revenue for fiscal is a result of a larger base of aspenone subscription bookings from previous periods being recognized as revenue on a subscription basis in the current year 
the modest amount of subscription revenue for the prior year was a result of subscription arrangements not being offered prior to fiscal we expect subscription revenue to continue to increase as customers renew existing contracts under our aspenone subscription offering and subscription contracts become a more significant portion of our term license portfolio 
software revenue year ended june  period to period change dollars in thousands software revenue as a percent of revenue the period over period increase in software revenue for fiscal resulted from increased revenue of million from point product arrangements with sms included for the entire term and million from perpetual arrangements  partially offset by decreased revenue of million from legacy software arrangements 
in fiscal  revenue from legacy software arrangements totaled million 
of the total legacy revenue  million  or  related to revenue that was not recorded in prior periods due to the arrangement not meeting all of the requirements for upfront revenue recognition 
amendments to legacy term arrangements that qualified for upfront revenue recognition in fiscal totaled million 
we expect legacy software revenue to continue to decrease and be replaced with subscription revenue as legacy arrangements are renewed on our subscription based license model 
we do not expect point products licensed on a perpetual basis to be a significant source of revenue 
services and other revenue year ended june  period to period change dollars in thousands professional services revenue sms and other revenue services and other revenue as a percent of revenue 
table of contents professional services revenue the period over period decrease in professional services revenue for fiscal primarily relates to decreased customer demand for professional services and higher professional services revenue deferrals 
we often compete with a number of qualified competitors when bidding for professional service contracts  particularly in developed markets where our products are well established 
having a robust network of providers that can provide professional services to support the deployment and utilization of our software is beneficial to our licensing and sms businesses 
however  this competitive environment has had an unfavorable impact on our professional services business 
under the aspenone subscription offering  revenue from committed professional service arrangements that are sold as a single arrangement with  or in contemplation of  a new aspenone licensing transaction is deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of a the period the services are performed or b the term of the related software arrangement 
as our typical contract term approximates five years  professional services revenue on these types of arrangements will usually be recognized over a longer period than under the upfront revenue model 
for fiscal  we had net deferrals of million for professional services bundled with aspenone transactions 
the timing of revenue recognition on certain large arrangements can also impact the comparability of professional services revenue from period to period 
in fiscal  we deferred the recognition of million of professional services revenue on certain large arrangements that did not meet the requirements for revenue recognition 
by comparison  in fiscal  we recognized approximately million of previously deferred professional services revenue due to a large project achieving certain milestones 
sms and other revenue sms and other revenue decreased for fiscal  primarily due to customers transitioning to the aspenone subscription offering  and  to a lesser extent  the continued trend of customers electing to replace perpetual license arrangements with new term contracts 
under the aspenone subscription offering  sms is included in subscription revenue  whereas it was presented as services and other revenue under the upfront revenue model 
expenses cost of subscription and software revenue year ended june  period to period change dollars in thousands cost of subscription and software revenue gross profit gross margin the period over period decrease in cost of subscription and software revenue for fiscal was primarily due to the reversal of a previously accrued liability resulting from the expiration of a technology vendor relationship 
this reduction in expense was partially offset by a larger percentage of sms services being provided to customers under aspenone subscription offerings 
we allocate the portion of sms costs associated with providing support services on our subscription products to cost of subscription and software revenue  in order to match the expense with the related revenue 
prior to the introduction of the aspenone subscription offering in fiscal  the costs associated with providing sms were all included in cost of services and other revenue 
as more 
table of contents customers transition to the subscription based licensing model  more of the related sms costs will be included in cost of subscription and software 
after excluding the impact of the reversal of the previously accrued liability for fiscal  our subscription and software gross margins were  which was slightly higher than fiscal cost of services and other revenue year ended june  period to period change dollars in thousands cost of services and other revenue gross profit gross margin our services and other revenue gross margins increased to in fiscal  compared with in fiscal  primarily as a result of lower expense in our professional services business  partially offset by higher professional service revenue deferrals and the impact of higher margin sms revenue migrating to subscription revenue under the aspenone subscription model 
going forward  we expect the revenues and costs related to our sms business to continue to migrate to cost of subscription and software revenue under the subscription based model 
because sms revenue has a higher gross profit margin than our professional services business we expect the reported gross profit margin of services and other revenue to decline 
cost of professional services revenue the largest component of the reduction in cost of services and other revenue for fiscal pertained to our professional services business  which accounted for million of the period over period decrease 
the decrease was primarily related to the reduction of staffing levels in the professional services organization and the timing of expense recognition on certain projects 
we reduced our staffing levels in fiscal to better align our cost structure with the decreased demand for professional services 
we received a full year of cost benefit related to these reductions in fiscal the timing of expense recognition on professional service arrangements can also impact the comparability of cost of professional services revenue from period to period 
in fiscal  we deferred costs of million on a large arrangement where we are also deferring the related revenue 
also contributing to the period over period decrease in costs was a loss accrual of approximately million related to a large professional service arrangement which was recognized in the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of sms and other revenue cost of sms and other revenue decreased million in fiscal  primarily due to the migration of sms costs on our aspenone subscription arrangements to cost of subscription and software revenue 
as the subscription business grows  we expect the cost of sms revenue to continue to migrate from cost of services and other revenue to cost of subscription and software revenue 
eventually  we expect the majority of the costs of our sms business to be presented in cost of subscription and software revenue

in weighing the cumulative losses against our ability to forecast operating results and the incremental growth in our installed base of customers and acceptance of our subscription based licensing model  we believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize these assets 
based on our current forecast  we expect that we will utilize all of our net operating losses nols  foreign tax credits  and a portion of our r d credits by fiscal year  based on a with and without approach 
we have retained a small valuation allowance in the us for the deferred tax asset related to our unrealized capital losses 
we do not have any investments currently on our balance sheet that would give rise to a capital gain  and as a result  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not receive a benefit from this deferred tax asset

table of contents subscription revenue year ended june  period to period change dollars in thousands subscription revenue as a percent of revenue not meaningful 
subscription agreements were not offered prior to fiscal the relatively small amount of subscription revenue recognized in the current year is a reflection of both the ratable recognition of these arrangements and the short time span that the aspenone subscription offering has been available 
we expect subscription revenue to increase as customers renew existing contracts under our aspenone subscription offering and subscription contracts become a more significant portion of our term license portfolio 
software revenue year ended june  period to period change dollars in thousands software revenue as a percent of revenue the decrease in software revenue was primarily attributable to the changes to our business model described above

having a robust network of providers that can provide professional services to support the deployment and utilization of our software is beneficial to our licensing and sms businesses 
however  this competitive environment can have an unfavorable impact on our professional services revenue 
although there were signs of increased customer demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we cannot be certain that this higher level of activity will continue throughout fiscal or beyond

under the aspenone subscription offering  revenue from committed professional service arrangements that are sold as a single arrangement with  or in contemplation of  a new aspenone licensing transaction is deferred and recognized on a ratable basis over the longer of a the period the services are performed and b the term of the related software arrangement 
we expect professional services deferred revenue related to new aspenone licensing transactions to grow in fiscal sms and other revenue year ended june  period to period change dollars in thousands sms and other revenue as a percent of revenue the decrease in sms and other revenue was primarily due to lower sms revenue associated with customers transitioning to the aspenone subscription offering and the continued trend of customers electing to replace perpetual license agreements with new term contracts 
under the aspenone subscription offering  sms revenue is included in subscription revenue  whereas it was included in services and other revenue under the prior licensing model 
additionally  the trend of moving customers from perpetual license agreements to term based contracts has resulted in decreased sms revenue for fiscal while the transition from perpetual to term based contracts generally results in larger combined software license and sms revenue for the business over the term of the arrangement  it results in decreased sms revenue  because the sms fee is calculated as a percentage of the license fee 
perpetual license arrangements typically have a larger initial license fee than term arrangements 
we expect sms and other revenue to continue to decrease as we transition our business to a predominantly subscription based licensing model 

table of contents expenses cost of subscription and software revenue year ended june  period to period change dollars in thousands cost of subscription and software revenue gross margin the period over period reduction in cost of subscription and software revenue was primarily due to decreases of million in royalty costs during the period related to our license products and lower capitalized software amortization charges of million 
previously our royalty expense was correlated to the mix of products sold and was typically recognized in the period in which revenue for those products was recorded 
as a result of the change to the aspenone subscription offering  royalty expense is incurred evenly over the contractual term  consistent with the revenue recognition on the related customer arrangement 
amortization of capitalized software costs for fiscal decreased million compared to fiscal as a result of reduced cost capitalization in the current period and previously capitalized items reaching the end of their useful life in fiscal the decrease in cost of subscription and software revenue was partially offset by million of costs associated with providing sms for the aspenone suite of products 
these costs were not included in the cost of subscription and software prior to the transition to the aspenone subscription offering in fiscal cost of services and other revenue year ended june  period to period change dollars in thousands cost of services and other revenue gross margin professional services revenue the largest component of the reduction in cost of services and other revenue in fiscal pertained to our professional services business  which accounted for million of the year over year decrease 
the decrease was primarily related to our reduction of staffing levels by approximately over the course of fiscal to better align our cost structure with the decreased demand for professional services 
the timing of expense recognition on professional service arrangements can also impact the comparability of cost of professional services revenue from period to period 
in fiscal  we recorded a loss accrual of approximately million related to a large professional service arrangement  which partially offset the impact of cost structure reductions 
sms and training revenue costs associated with sms and training revenue increased million in fiscal as compared to fiscal as the subscription business grows  we expect the cost of sms revenue to migrate from cost of services and other revenue to cost of subscription and software revenue 
currently it is not possible to predict the rate at which this migration will occur  because that rate will be a function of adoption of our aspenone subscription offering 
we do not have sufficient experience with the rate of adoption to provide a meaningful forecast of this change 
eventually  we expect the majority of our cost of sms revenue to be accounted for in cost of subscription and software revenue 

table of contents stock based compensation expense related to cost of services and other revenue was million higher in fiscal compared to fiscal we expect the reported gross profit margin of services and other revenue to continue to decline over the next several years  as sms revenue is reclassified to subscription revenue  since sms revenue has a high gross profit margin relative to the other revenue streams included in services and other revenue 
selling and marketing expense year ended june  period to period change dollars in thousands selling and marketing expense as a percent of revenue the increase in selling and marketing expense was predominantly the result of higher commissions of million  stock based compensation costs of million and payroll and benefits expenses of million

selling and marketing payroll and benefit expenses increased in fiscal due to increased headcount compared to fiscal these expense increases were partially offset by million of reductions in third party commissions

the increase in legal fees in fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to our increased use of external legal services during the fiscal year  as well as the impact of us reaching the maximum reimbursable limit of an insurance policy in the second quarter of fiscal under which certain legal costs were previously covered 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we reached the maximum reimbursable limit for the policy and as a result  our expenses increased in fiscal the million increase in payroll and benefit expenses is related to increased average headcount  primarily within the finance organization

as of june   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash and cash equivalents 
we previously maintained a bank credit facility  which we decided not to renew or extend when it matured on february  we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and our cash flow from operating activities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next twelve months 
to the extent our cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operating activities are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to raise additional funds through the financing of additional receivables or from public or private equity or debt financings 
we also may need to raise additional funds in the event we determine in the future to effect one or more acquisitions of businesses  technologies and products 
if additional funding is required  we may not be able to effect a receivable  equity or debt financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 

table of contents the following table summarizes our cash flow activities for the years indicated year ended june  dollars in thousands cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rates on cash balances increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities our primary source of cash is from the annual fee payments associated with our software license arrangements and related software support services  and to a lesser extent from professional services and training 
we believe that cash inflows from our term license business will grow as we benefit from the continued growth of our portfolio of term license contracts  and as customers renew expiring contracts that were previously paid upfront 
we anticipate that existing cash balances  together with funds generated from operations  will be sufficient to finance our operations and meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
cash from operating activities provided million during fiscal this amount resulted from net income of million  adjusted for non cash benefits of million and a net million source of cash due to decreases in operating assets and increases in operating liabilities 
non cash items within net income consisted primarily of a million benefit from income taxes due to the reversal of a significant portion of our us valuation allowance 
other non cash items contributing to net income included net credits to our provision for doubtful account of million and million of net unrealized foreign currency gains 
partially offsetting these items were non cash charges of million for stock based compensation expense and million of depreciation and amortization 
our cash balance increased in part due to a million decrease in operating assets and an increase in operating liabilities 
the cash generated from this change consisted of a decreases in installment and collateralized receivables totaling million  b a decrease in accounts receivable of million and d an increase in deferred revenue of million 
partially offsetting these sources of cash were decreases in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  an increase in prepaid expenses and other assets of million  an increase in unbilled services of million and a decrease in income taxes payable of million

we are not currently party to any material purchase contracts related to future capital expenditures 
financing activities during fiscal we used million of cash for financing activities

table of contents paid million for the repurchase of our common stock  paid withholding taxes of million on vested and settled restricted stock units  and  received proceeds of million from the exercise of employee stock options during fiscal as discussed further in net repayments on secured borrowings for fiscal and  we superseded a large  previously financed arrangement in the fourth quarter of fiscal and had not yet remitted the payment to the financial institution at june  net repayments on secured borrowings for fiscal and when previously financed receivables contracts are replaced  or superseded  with new arrangements  the secured borrowings collateralized by those receivables become immediately due and payable 
as a result  they are reported in accrued expenses and other current liabilities until payment is remitted to the financial institution 
although our financing arrangements do not obligate us to replace superseded receivables  the terms on which we repurchase and replace superseded receivables may make it advantageous to do so 
it is our intention to structure such replacements so that they do not result in a net increase in our secured borrowings balance  although this is not always possible  given the timing and size of the specific receivables involved 
the following schedule reconciles our net repayments on secured borrowings for fiscal and year ended june  dollars in thousands secured borrowings  beginning of year secured borrowings  end of year net change in secured borrowings increase decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities for amounts due to financing institutions impact of foreign currency net repayments on secured borrowings accrued expenses and other current liabilities include million  million and million for amounts due to financing institutions at june   and  respectively 
our current liability for amounts due to financing institutions totaled million at june   an increase of million from june  the increase relates to the superseding of a large previously financed arrangement 
we are currently in discussions with the financing institution to determine whether or not we will replace the superseded installments with installments of a similar duration and size 
because an exchange has not occurred in fiscal  the balance of the superseded receivables due to financing institutions is a current liability at june  in fiscal  the million of proceeds was used to replace the receivables that had been superseded in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which totaled million at june   as well as other agreements superseded during fiscal year we did not finance any receivables to fund operations in fiscal  and we have not done so since the second quarter of fiscal we expect the existing combined secured borrowings and amounts due to financing institution balances included in our consolidated balance sheet at june  to continue to decline during the remainder of fiscal and thereafter  as we continue the trend of not replacing securitized borrowings as they are paid down 

table of contents we have continued to reduce our secured borrowings and amounts due to financing institution balances  while maintaining our cash balance in thousands june  dollars in thousands cash and cash equivalents secured borrowings amounts due to financing institutions total secured borrowings and amounts due to financing institutions borrowings collateralized by receivable contracts we maintain arrangements with general electric capital corporation and silicon valley bank providing for borrowings that are secured by our installment and other receivable contracts  and for which limited recourse exists against us 
under these programs  we and the financial institution must agree to enter into each transaction and negotiate the amount borrowed and interest rate secured by each receivable 
the customers payments of the underlying receivables fund the repayment of the related amounts borrowed 
the weighted average interest rate on the secured borrowings was at june  the collateralized receivables earn interest income  and the secured borrowings accrue borrowing costs at approximately the same interest rate 
we did not finance any receivables to fund operations in fiscal  and we have not done so since the second quarter of fiscal we have sold some large dollar receivables in order to fund the repurchase of several large groups of smaller receivables previously sold to the banks  for the purpose of simplifying our administration of the programs and replacing previously financed receivables that have been superseded and repurchased 
we estimate that there was approximately million available under the silicon valley bank program at june  as the collection of the collateralized receivables and resulting payment of the borrowing obligation reduces the outstanding balance  the availability under the arrangement can be increased 
we expect to maintain our access to cash under this arrangement 
under the terms of these programs  we have transferred the receivables to the financial institutions with limited financial recourse to us 
we can be required to repurchase the receivables under certain circumstances in case of specific defaults by us as set forth in the program terms 
potential recourse obligations are primarily related to the silicon valley bank arrangement  which requires us to pay interest to silicon valley bank for a limited period when the underlying customer has not paid by the receivable due date 
other than the specific items noted above  the financial institution bears the credit risk of the customers associated with the receivables the institution purchased 
contractual obligations and requirements as of june   our contractual obligations consisted primarily of operating leases for our headquarters and other facilities  royalty  debt and other obligations

the standby letters of credit were issued by silicon valley bank in the united states and national westminster bank in the united kingdom  and secure performance on professional services contracts and rental agreements 
the above table does not reflect any amounts relating to transfers of certain receivables under our receivable sale facilities 
repayments of borrowings under these facilities are funded by the payments made by the customer either to the applicable financial institution directly or to us as agent  with no financial recourse to us 
since we do not have any contractual obligation to fund these payments and there are no financial guarantees issued in relation to these transactions  we do not have any contractual payment obligations relating to these transactions 
off balance sheet arrangements as of june   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of regulation s k of the sec 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with the following critical accounting policies have the greatest potential impact on our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  accounting for income taxes  and

revenue recognition four basic criteria must be satisfied before license revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement between us and an end user  delivery of our product has occurred  the fee for the product is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
our management uses its judgment concerning the satisfaction of these four basic criteria  particularly the criteria relating to the determination of whether the arrangement fees are fixed or determinable and to the collectability of the arrangement fees  during evaluation of each revenue transaction 
fee is fixed or determinable we assess whether a fee is fixed or determinable at the outset of the arrangement 
significant judgment is involved in making this assessment 
under our upfront revenue model  we are able to demonstrate that the fees are fixed or determinable for all arrangements  including those for our term licenses that contain extended payment terms 
we have an established history of collecting under the terms of these contracts without providing concessions to customers 
in addition  we also assess whether contract modifications to an existing term arrangement constitute a concession 
in making this assessment  significant analysis is performed to ensure that no concessions are given 
our software license agreements do not include right of return or exchange 
with the introduction of our aspenone subscription offering and the changes to the licensing terms for point products licensed on a fixed term basis  we cannot assert that the fees in these new arrangements are fixed or determinable because the rights provided to customers and the economics of the arrangements are not comparable to our historical transactions with other customers under the upfront revenue model 
as a result  the amount of revenue recognized for these arrangements is limited by the amount of customer payments currently due 
for our aspenone subscription arrangements this generally results in the fees being recognized ratably over the term of the contracts 
for our point product licenses with sms included for the entire term of the arrangement  this generally results in the license fee being recognized as each payment comes due  while the allocated portion of the sms revenue is recognized ratably over its annual term 
collection of fee is probable we assess the probability of collecting from each customer at the outset of the arrangement based on a number of factors  including the customer payment history  its current creditworthiness  economic conditions in the customer industry and geographic location  and general economic conditions 
if in our judgment collection of a fee is not probable  revenue is recognized as cash is collected  provided all other conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
vsoe of fair value for sms and professional services we have established vsoe for sms and professional services  but not for our software products 
we assess vsoe of fair value for sms and professional services based on an analysis of standalone sales of sms and professional services  using the bell shaped curve approach 
we use the optional renewals of sms on our legacy term license arrangements to support vsoe of fair value for sms included in our fixed term point product arrangements 
the license product offerings and the sms in the legacy term arrangements and the point product arrangements have been the same 
in july  we released an enhanced sms offering to provide more value to our customers 
as part of this offering  customers will receive x support  faster response times and dedicated technical advocates 
the enhanced sms offering is being provided to both i aspenone subscription customers and ii customers who have licensed point products on a term basis with sms included for the term of the arrangement 

table of contents we do not have a history of selling this new sms offering to customers on a stand alone basis and cannot establish vendor specific evidence of fair value  or vsoe 
as a result  beginning in july  the revenue associated with point product arrangements that include the enhanced sms offering is being recognized on a daily ratable basis  consistent with the revenue recognition of fees on our aspenone subscription offering arrangements 
beginning in fiscal  the ratable revenue from both aspenone subscription arrangements and point product arrangements with enhanced sms will be presented as subscription and software revenue 
the new sms offering did not impact our results of operations or income statement presentation for fiscal   or professional services revenue we provide professional services on a time and materials or fixed price basis 
we recognize professional services fees for time and materials contracts based upon hours worked and contractually agreed upon hourly rates 
we recognize revenue from fixed price engagements using the proportional performance method  based on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated project costs 
the use of the proportional performance method depends upon our ability to reliably estimate the direct costs to complete a project 
we use historical experience as a basis for future estimates to complete current projects 
additionally  management believes that costs are the best available measure of performance 
reimbursable amounts received from customers for out of pocket expenses are recorded as revenue 
if the costs to complete a project are not estimable or the completion is uncertain  the revenue is recognized upon completion of the services 
we have occasionally been required to commit unanticipated additional resources to complete projects  which have resulted in lower than anticipated income or losses on those contracts 
provisions for estimated losses on contracts are made during the period in which such losses become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax rates and statutes that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets can result from unused operating losses  and research and development and foreign tax credit carryforwards and deductions recorded for financial statement purposes prior to them being deductable on a tax return 
valuation allowances are provided against net deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income and the reversal of taxable temporary differences 
we consider  among other available information  scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  limitations on the availability of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards  and other evidence assessing the potential realization of deferred tax assets 
adjustments to the valuation allowance are included in the tax provision in our consolidated statements of operations in the period they become known or can be estimated 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income for jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets may be recoverable 
a significant portion of the us valuation allowance was released in the fourth quarter of fiscal year while we are currently operating at a taxable loss and have a history of losses  we have been able to forecast future operating results sufficient to utilize our deferred tax assets 
in 
table of contents weighing the cumulative losses against our ability to forecast operating results and the incremental growth in our installed base of customers and acceptance of our subscription based licensing model  we believe it is more likely than not that we will utilize these assets 
based on our current forecast  we expect that we will utilize all of our nols  foreign tax credits  and a portion of our r d credits by fiscal  based on a with and without approach 
we have retained a small valuation allowance in the us for the deferred tax asset related to our unrealized capital losses 
we do not have any investments currently that would give rise to a capital gain  and as a result  we believe that it is more likely than not that we will not receive a benefit from this deferred tax asset 
we have also retained a valuation allowance on certain foreign subsidiary nol carryfowards 
at june   our total valuation allowance was million 
for fiscal  our income tax provision included amounts determined under the provisions of fin  accounting for uncertain tax positions currently included as provisions of asc topic  which was adopted as of july  and is intended to satisfy additional income tax assessments  including interest and penalties  that could result from any tax return positions for which the likelihood of sustaining the position on audit does not meet a threshold of more likely than not 
the tax accrual included penalties and interest  which were recorded as a component of our income tax expense 
tax liabilities under fin were recorded as a component of our income taxes payable and other non current liabilities balance and totaled million as of june  the ultimate amount of taxes due will not be known until examinations are completed and settled or the audit periods are closed by statute 
our us and foreign tax returns are subject to periodic compliance examinations by various local and national tax authorities through periods defined by the tax code in the applicable jurisdiction 
the years prior to are closed in the united states  although the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits generated in earlier periods will keep these periods open for examination 
similarly  the years prior to are closed in the united kingdom  although the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards generated in earlier periods will keep the periods open for examination 
our canadian subsidiaries are subject to audit from forward  and certain other of our international subsidiaries are subject to audit from forward 
in connection with examinations of tax filings  tax contingencies can arise from differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations relative to the amount  timing or proper inclusion or exclusion of revenue and expenses in taxable income or loss 
for periods that remain subject to audit  we have asserted and unasserted potential assessments that are subject to final tax settlements 
loss contingencies the outcomes of legal proceedings and claims brought against us are subject to significant uncertainty 
we accrue estimated liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation and other sources when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the claim  assessment or damages can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
change in these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
under the terms of substantially all of our license agreements  we have agreed to indemnify customers for costs and damages arising from claims against such customers based on  among other things  allegations that our software products infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party 
in most cases  in the event of an infringement claim  we retain the right to procure for the customer the right to continue using the software product or to replace or modify the software product to eliminate the infringement while providing substantially equivalent functionality 
if neither of those actions can be reasonably achieved  we may terminate the license agreement and provide a refund to the customer 

table of contents these indemnification provisions are accounted for in accordance with asc topic the likelihood that we will be required to make refunds to customers under these indemnification provisions is considered remote 
in most cases  and where legally enforceable  the indemnification refund is limited to the amount of the license fees paid by the customer

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of conducting business  we are exposed to certain risks associated with potential changes in market conditions 
these market risks include changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
in order to manage the volatility of our more significant market risks  we may enter into derivative financial instruments such as forward currency exchange contracts
