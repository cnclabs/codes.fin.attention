table of contents effective january   we adopted a new accounting standard that changed the method of accounting for convertible debt that may be partially or wholly settled in cash 
as required by this standard  we retrospectively applied this change in accounting to all prior periods for which we had applicable outstanding convertible debt 
under this method of accounting  the debt and equity components of our convertible notes are bifurcated and accounted for separately 
the equity components of our convertible notes  including our convertible notes  convertible notes and zero coupon convertible notes  are included in common stock and additional paid in capital in the consolidated balance sheets  with a corresponding reduction in the carrying values of these convertible notes as of the date of issuance or modification  as applicable 
the reduced carrying values of our convertible notes are being accreted back to their principal amounts through the recognition of non cash interest expense 
this results in recognizing interest expense on these borrowings at effective rates approximating what we would have incurred had we issued nonconvertible debt with otherwise similar terms

overview the following management s discussion and analysis md a is intended to assist the reader in understanding amgen s business 
md a is provided as a supplement to  and should be read in conjunction with  our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our results of operations discussed in md a are presented in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
we are the largest independent biotechnology medicines company 
we discover  develop  manufacture and market medicines for grievous illnesses 
we concentrate on innovative novel medicines based on advances in cellular and molecular biology 
our mission is to serve patients 
we operate in one business segment human therapeutics 
therefore  our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis 
we earn revenues and income and generate cash primarily from sales of human therapeutic products in the areas of supportive cancer care  nephrology and inflammation 
our principal products include aranesp  epogen  neulasta  neupogen and enbrel  all of which are sold in the united states 
enbrel is marketed under a collaboration agreement with pfizer in the united states and canada 
our international product sales consist principally of european sales of aranesp  neulasta and neupogen 
for additional information about our products  their approved indications and where they are marketed  see item business marketed products 
throughout and early  various developments occurred regarding our business  including regulatory and reimbursement developments associated with certain of our marketed products and product candidates 
most notably  the fda approved prolia and xgeva tm  and the ec granted marketing authorization for prolia for certain indications 
in addition  healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the united states 
as a result of these and other developments  we have various opportunities to grow our business but will also continue to face various challenges 
the following summarizes certain key opportunities and challenges 
we have various opportunities to grow our business 
in the near term  we believe the currently approved indications for prolia and xgeva tm represent significant commercial opportunities 
in addition  receipt of regulatory approvals in new geographic territories or for additional indications for these products may also provide further significant opportunities 
for example  the results of our recently announced phase trial evaluating 
table of contents xgeva tm versus placebo in men with castrate resistant prostate cancer met its primary endpoint 
this study will form the basis of planned marketing applications  which we expect to submit to regulatory authorities beginning in the first half of  for the prevention of bone metastases in prostate cancer 
longer term growth may also be achieved by the successful development of our late stage pipeline and strategic business development opportunities  such as our recently announced agreement to acquire biovex 
in addition  longer term growth may also be achieved by expansion into emerging markets and japan 
looking forward  we believe our products will continue to face various regulatory  reimbursement and competitive challenges 
our esa products  in particular  have several near term challenges that could result in further reductions in sales 
for example  epogen sales will be impacted by the final rule on bundling in dialysis that became effective in further  the nca opened by cms in june and the results of the medcac meetings held in march and january could lead to an ncd for the use of esas in patients with kidney disease  which could impact the use of or reimbursement for esas to manage anemia in patients with ckd and or dialysis related anemia 
in addition  the fda approved rems for esas may continue to impact aranesp sales in the supportive cancer care setting 
future product label changes including those we proposed prior to the crdac meeting  any others required in connection with treat or the crdac meeting and any from the plr conversion process  may also impact the use of esas in ckd 
since we rely in large part on the reimbursement of our products through government programs such as medicare and medicaid  the recently enacted healthcare reform law has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales of our products in the united states and on our results of operations 
the provisions of the new legislation impacted our us product sales by approximately million in  and we anticipate that our us product sales in will be impacted by million to million 
furthermore  we estimate that our results of operations for will be impacted by an additional million to million related to a new fee on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs established by that legislation  which is not deductible for us federal income tax purposes 
certain of our products will also continue to face increasing competitive pressure  in particular enbrel in the united states  as well as aranesp  neulasta and neupogen in europe as a result of biosimilars 
in addition  over the next several years  the existing patents on our principal products will begin to expire  and we expect to face increasing competition thereafter 
see item business marketed products 
certain of these developments are expected to have a material adverse impact on our sales and results of operations 
however  these effects may be mitigated by certain of the opportunities we have to grow our business  discussed above  by other strategic initiatives or by increased efforts to manage our expenses 
selected financial data the following table presents selected financial data for the years ended december  and amounts in millions  except percentages and per share data change product sales us international total product sales other revenues total revenues operating expenses operating income net income diluted eps diluted shares the following discusses certain key changes in our results of operations for the year ended december  as well as our financial condition as of december  
table of contents the increase in our us product sales for reflects overall growth for all of our marketed products  except for our esa products  which declined 
the growth in sales of our non esa products reflects increases primarily in average net sales prices and  to a lesser extent  favorable changes in wholesaler inventories 
us product sales in were unfavorably impacted by million as a result of the recently enacted us healthcare reform law 
the increase in our international product sales for reflects overall growth for all of our marketed products  except for aranesp  which declined 
the increase in other revenues for was due primarily to milestone payments earned from glaxo in connection with certain commercial milestones for prolia in the eu and from takeda in connection with certain regulatory milestones for vectibix in japan 
the increase in operating expenses for was due principally to higher cost of sales  due primarily to higher bulk manufacturing costs  as well as higher selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  due primarily to increased promotional costs for prolia and our other marketed products 
net income was relatively unchanged in as the increases in operating income  discussed above  and interest and other income were offset substantially by an increase in our provision for income taxes 
the increase in interest and other income was due primarily to higher net realized gains on sales of investments and higher interest income 
the increase in our provision for income taxes was due principally to reduced benefits resulting from settlements with tax authorities in the increase in diluted eps for principally reflects a reduction in our weighted average shares used to compute diluted eps resulting from our stock repurchase program  including approximately million shares repurchased in at a total cost of billion 
although changes in foreign currency rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales  the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is offset partially by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities 
our hedging activities seek to offset the impact  both positive and negative  that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure  primarily with respect to product sales denominated in the euro 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled billion  and total debt outstanding was billion  including billion which was repaid in february of our total cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance as of december   approximately billion was generated from operations in foreign tax jurisdictions and is intended to be invested indefinitely outside of the united states 
under current tax laws  if those funds were repatriated for use in our us operations  we would be required to pay additional us federal and state income taxes at the applicable marginal tax rates 

table of contents results of operations product sales for the years ended december   and  worldwide product sales and total product sales by geographic region were as follows dollar amounts in millions change change aranesp epogen neulasta neupogen enbrel sensipar mimpara vectibix nplate prolia xgeva tm other total product sales total us total international total product sales product sales are influenced by a number of factors  some of which may impact the sales of certain of our existing products more significantly than others  including  but not necessarily limited to our contracting and pricing strategies  recent and future reimbursement changes resulting from governmental or private organization regulations or guidelines relating to the use of our products  legislative reform in federal  state and foreign jurisdictions  cost containment pressures  and the mix of reimbursement from governmental and private payers  clinical trial outcomes  including adverse events or results from clinical trials  including sub analyses  studies or meta analyses performed by us or by others including our licensees or independent investigators  which could impact product safety labeling and may negatively impact healthcare provider prescribing behavior  use of our products  regulatory or private healthcare organization medical guidelines and reimbursement practices  changes in clinical practice  including those resulting from the development of new protocols  tests and or treatments  adoption of and adherence to risk management activities  such as a rems  undertaken by us or required by the fda or other regulatory authorities  product label changes  patient population growth  segment growth and penetration  new product launches and indications  expansion into new international markets  
table of contents competitive products  including biosimilars  patent expirations and our ability to obtain and defend our patent and other intellectual property rights  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  adequacy of product supply and distribution  effectiveness of our marketing efforts  including those conducted under collaboration agreements  concentration of customer purchasing power  and acquisitions 
our us product sales are also subject to certain other influences throughout the year  including wholesaler and end user buying patterns eg  holiday driven wholesaler and end user stocking  contract driven buying and patients purchasing products later in the year after satisfying their annual insurance deductibles 
such factors can result in higher demand for our products and or higher wholesaler inventory levels and  therefore  higher product sales for a given three month period  generally followed by a reduction in demand and or a drawdown in wholesaler inventories and a corresponding decline in product sales in the subsequent three month period 
for example  sales of our products in the united states for the three months ended march have been slightly lower relative to the immediately preceding three month period  which we believe to be due  in part  to certain of these factors 
while this can result in variability in quarterly product sales on a sequential basis  these effects have generally not been significant when comparing product sales in the three months ended march with product sales in the corresponding period of the prior year 
in addition  general economic conditions may affect  or in some cases amplify  certain of these factors with a corresponding impact on our product sales

the decrease in international aranesp sales for was due primarily to a decrease in demand 
us sales of aranesp for benefited from certain changes in accounting estimates related to product sales return reserves 
excluding the positive impact of these changes in accounting estimates  the decrease in us aranesp sales of approximately for was due primarily to a decline in unit demand and a low single digit percentage point decrease in the average net sales price 
the decline in unit demand reflects the negative impact  primarily in the supportive cancer care setting  of a product safety related label change in august as well as an overall decline in the segment and a slight loss of segment share 
excluding an million unfavorable foreign exchange impact  international aranesp sales for remained unchanged 

table of contents in addition to other factors mentioned in the product sales section above  future aranesp sales will depend  in part  on such factors as regulatory developments  including the rems for our esas approved by the fda in february product label changes  including those proposed prior to the october crdac meeting and any others required in connection with treat or the crdac meeting  as well as any from the plr conversion process  reimbursement developments  including the potential imposition of an ncd or other developments resulting from the nca opened by cms in june and the associated medcac meetings  and development of new protocols  tests and or treatments for cancer and or new chemotherapy treatments or alternatives to chemotherapy that may have reduced and may continue to reduce the use of chemotherapy in some patients

the increase in unit demand was due principally to patient population growth and increased dose utilization 
in addition to other factors mentioned in the product sales section above  future epogen sales will depend  in part  on such factors as reimbursement developments  including those resulting from cms s final rule on bundling in dialysis  other cms activities  including the potential imposition of an ncd or other developments resulting from the nca opened by cms in june and the associated medcac meetings  regulatory developments  such as those resulting from product label changes  including those proposed prior to the october crdac meeting and any others required in connection with treat or the crdac meeting  as well as any from the plr conversion process  changes in dose fluctuations as healthcare providers continue to refine their treatment practices in accordance with approved labeling  and adoption of alternative therapies or development of new modalities to treat anemia associated with crf

recent accounting pronouncements in january  we adopted a newly issued accounting standard which requires additional disclosure about the amounts of and reasons for significant transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy discussed in note  fair value measurement 
this standard also clarifies existing disclosure requirements related to the level of disaggregation of fair value measurements for each class of assets and liabilities and disclosures about inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value for both recurring and nonrecurring level and level measurements 
in addition  effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   this standard requires additional disclosure and requires an entity to present disaggregated information about activity for level fair value measurements on a gross as opposed to a net basis 
as this accounting standard only requires enhanced disclosure  its adoption did not impact our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  we adopted a newly issued accounting standard which addresses the accounting for the annual fee due from the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry beginning january   mandated by the ppaca and the companion health care and education reconciliation act  which made certain changes and adjustments to ppaca 
we refer to these two laws collectively as the new healthcare reform law 
the new healthcare reform law obligates a pharmaceutical manufacturer  upon the first gross receipt during a calendar year from prescription drug sales under any specified government program  to pay an annual fee to the us government 
the new accounting standard requires the liability for the annual fee to be estimated and recorded in full upon the first qualifying sale with a corresponding deferred cost established that is to be amortized and recognized as an operating expense over 
table of contents the calendar year that it is payable using a straight line method of allocation unless another method better allocates the fee

these interest rate swap agreements qualify and are designated as fair value hedges 
as of december  and  we had interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate face value of billion and billion  respectively 
the effective rates on these swaps range from libor plus to libor plus 
see note  financing arrangements and note  derivative instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our interest rate swap agreements

under this registration statement  all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance 
this shelf registration expires in april as of december   we have million remaining under a shelf registration statement that was established in in connection with this shelf registration  we established a million medium term note program under which medium term debt securities may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance 
as of december   no securities were outstanding under this medium term note program 
certain of our financing arrangements contain non financial covenants and we were in compliance with all applicable covenants as of december  none of our financing arrangements contain any financial covenants 
cash flows the following table summarizes our cash flow activity for the years ended december   and in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities operating cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds 
cash provided by operating activities during decreased due primarily to the timing and amount of payments to taxing authorities 
cash provided by operating activities during increased due primarily to higher net income of million and a higher dividend payment from ka of million  offset partially by the prior year receipt of million for an upfront milestone payment related to our licensing agreement with takeda  and the negative impact of the timing and amounts of receipts from customers and payments to vendors and others 
investing net purchases of marketable securities were billion for compared to net purchases of billion and billion for and  respectively 
capital expenditures totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
capital expenditures in and were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in puerto rico and other site developments 
capital expenditures in were associated primarily with manufacturing capacity expansions in puerto rico  fremont and other site developments and with investment in our global erp system and other information systems projects 
we currently estimate spending on capital projects and equipment to be approximately million 

table of contents financing in december  the board of directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional billion of common stock of which a total of billion remains available as of december  the manner of purchases  the amount we spend and the number of shares repurchased will vary based on a variety of factors  including stock price  blackout periods in which we are restricted from repurchasing shares and the impact of repurchases on our credit rating  and may include private block purchases as well as market transactions 
a summary of our repurchase activity under our stock repurchase program for the years ended december   and is as follows in millions shares dollars shares dollars shares dollars first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter total the total cost of shares repurchased during the three months ended june  excludes approximately million paid in july in connection with the final settlement of an accelerated share repurchase program entered into in may as discussed above  we issued debt securities in various offerings that resulted in net proceeds of billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
in addition  we repaid billion and billion of notes in and  respectively 
we receive cash from the exercise of employee stock options 
employee stock option exercises provided million  million and million of cash in  and  respectively 
proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options will vary from period to period based upon  among other factors  fluctuations in the market value of our stock relative to the exercise price of such options 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
additionally  the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon terms or amounts for some obligations 

table of contents the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type in millions payments due by period year years years years contractual obligations total and and and beyond long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations unrecognized tax benefits total contractual obligations the long term debt obligation amounts include future interest payments 
future interest payments are included on our financing arrangements at the fixed contractual coupon rates 
to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt  we enter into interest rate swap agreements  which effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating libor based coupon over the life of the respective note 
we used an interest rate forward curve at december  to compute the net amounts to be included in the table above for future interest payments on our variable rate interest rate swaps 
see note  financing arrangements to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our long term debt obligations and our interest swap agreements 
purchase obligations relate primarily to i our long term supply agreements with third party manufacturers  which are based on firm commitments for the purchase of production capacity  ii r d commitments including those related to clinical trials for new and existing products  iii capital expenditures  and iv open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business 
our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events 
long term liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits utbs net of foreign tax credits and federal tax benefit of state taxes and related accrued interest and penalties totaling approximately million at december  are not included in the table above because  due to their nature  there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities 
in addition to the above table  we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts  which in the aggregate are significant  upon the achievement of various development  regulatory and commercial milestones in conjunction with collaborative agreements we have entered into with third parties 
these payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events  which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring 
these contingent payments have not been included in the table above or recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
as of december   the maximum amount that may be payable in the future under all such arrangements is approximately billion 
summary of critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements 
some of those judgments can be subjective and complex  and therefore  actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
product sales  sales deductions and returns revenues from sales of our products are recognized when the products are shipped and title and risk of loss have passed 
product sales are recorded net of accruals for estimated rebates  wholesaler chargebacks  cash discounts and other deductions collectively  sales deductions and returns  which are established at the time of sale 
we analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly 
amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate 
accruals are also adjusted to 
table of contents reflect actual results 
the following table summarizes amounts recorded in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets for sales deductions in millions cash other rebates chargebacks discounts deductions total balance as of january  amounts charged against product sales payments balance as of december  amounts charged against product sales payments balance as of december  amounts charged against product sales payments balance as of december  for the years ended december   and  total sales deductions were  and of gross product sales  respectively 
included in these amounts are immaterial adjustments related to prior year sales due to changes in estimates 
such amounts represent less than of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales for and and less than for in late  we began shifting our discount structure as a component of broader contracting revisions to be more heavily weighted toward fixed prices to healthcare providers reflected as chargebacks in the table above instead of rebates  resulting in a corresponding reduction in rebates and an increase in chargebacks  as noted in the table above 
in the united states  we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers  such as physicians or their clinics  dialysis centers  hospitals and pharmacies 
products we sell in the eu are distributed principally to hospitals and or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the product is sold 
we monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties  and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels generally two to three weeks given end user demand 
accordingly  historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly impacted our method of estimating sales deductions and returns 
accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales 
these estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements  specific known market events and trends  internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns 
sales deductions are substantially product specific and  therefore  for any given year  can be impacted by the mix of products sold 
rebates primarily include amounts paid to payers in the united states and are based on contractual arrangements which vary by product  by payer and individual payer plans 
we estimate the amount of rebate that will be paid based on the product sold  contractual terms  historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels and accrue these rebates in the period the related sale is recorded 
we adjust the accrual as more information becomes available and to reflect actual experience 
estimating such rebates is complicated due to the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability  which could take up to one year 
those rebates totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances 
however  actual results may differ 
based on our recent experience  changes in annual estimates related to prior annual periods have been less than of the estimated rebate amounts charged against product sales for and and less than for these changes in annual estimates relate substantially to sales made in the immediately preceding annual period 
a change in our rebate estimate attributable to rebates recognized in would have had an impact of approximately million on our product sales and a corresponding impact on our financial condition and liquidity 
wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the united states at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers 
when the healthcare providers 
table of contents purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices  the wholesaler charges us for the difference between the prices it pays us and the prices it charges the healthcare providers 
the provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers 
those chargebacks from wholesalers totaled billion  billion and billion for the years ended december   and  respectively 
accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates and closely approximate actual results since chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare provider  and we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks 
included in other deductions in the table above are rebates and discounts paid to state medicaid offices to participate in the medicaid program 
in  healthcare reform legislation was enacted in the united states which has and will continue to significantly increase our medicaid rebates and discounts 
certain provisions of this new legislation became effective in  while others will become effective in later years 
the provisions of this new legislation reduced our us product sales in by approximately million  and we anticipate that our us product sales in will be negatively impacted by million to million by this legislation 
product returns returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis 
historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product  when appropriate 
historically  sales return provisions have been insignificant  amounting to less than of gross product sales 
furthermore  changes in estimates for prior year sales return provisions have historically also been insignificant 
inventories produced in preparation for product launches the company capitalizes inventories produced in preparation for product launches when the related product candidates are considered to have a high probability of regulatory approval and the related costs are expected to be recoverable through the commercialization of the product 
in connection with the decision to capitalize such inventory  we evaluate among other factors any identified risks or concerns with respect to the product candidate s safety and efficacy  the status of related discussions with regulatory authorities and the outlook for commercial success  including the existence of current or anticipated competitive products and any reimbursement concerns 
in addition  we evaluate any risks associated with the manufacturing of the product candidate as well as consider the remaining shelf life of the inventory in relation to the expected launch date 
upon capitalization  we continue to monitor any changes in these factors 
in the event of any significant negative developments  we may be required to impair previously capitalized costs 
at december   we had capitalized approximately million of inventory costs related to our then late stage product candidate  denosumab 
during  we received various approvals for denosumab from regulatory authorities in the united states  the eu and various other countries and commenced selling the product in certain geographic markets 
income taxes the company provides for income taxes based on pretax income  applicable tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which it operates 
we recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements on a particular tax position are measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon settlement 
the amount of utbs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances  such as significant amendments to existing tax law  new regulations or interpretations by the taxing authorities  new information obtained during a tax examination  or resolution of an examination 
we believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns 
we recognize both accrued interest and penalties  where appropriate  related to utbs in income tax expense 

table of contents certain items are included in the company s tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements 
such timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements 
the company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities are either i a tax expense recognized in the financial statements for which payment has been deferred  or ii an expense for which the company has already taken a deduction on the tax return  but has not yet recognized the expense in the financial statements 
our effective tax rate reflects the impact of undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are intended to be invested indefinitely outside the united states based on our projected cash flow  working capital and long term investment requirements of our us and foreign operations 
if future events  including material changes in estimates of cash  working capital and long term investment requirements necessitate that certain assets associated with these earnings be repatriated to the united states  under current tax laws an additional tax provision and related liability would be required at the applicable us and state marginal income tax rates which could have a material adverse effect on both our future effective tax rate and our financial results 
our operations are subject to the tax laws  regulations and administrative practices of the united states  us state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business 
significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations 
for example  substantial reform of us tax law regarding tax on certain foreign profits could result in an increase in our effective tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in various legal proceedings such as intellectual property disputes  contractual disputes  governmental investigations and class action suits 
certain of these proceedings are discussed in note  contingencies and commitments to the consolidated financial statements 
we record accruals for such contingencies to the extent we conclude their occurrence is both probable and estimable 
we consider all relevant factors when making assessments regarding these contingencies 
while it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcome of these items  one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in the general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business 
to reduce certain of these risks  we monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits  requiring letters of credit and obtaining credit insurance  as we deem appropriate 
in addition  we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions primarily with investment grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by type and issuer 
we also enter into various types of foreign exchange and interest rate derivative hedging transactions with counterparties with investment grade credit ratings as part of our risk management program 
we do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes 
in the capital and credit markets  strong demand for fixed income led to historically low interest rates on corporate debt issuances during short term interest rates on us treasury instruments continued to decline as a result of the federal reserve s monetary policy  which included a program to buy back us treasury instruments 
as a result  in the discussion that follows  we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of basis points from those at december  and continued uncertainty surrounding european sovereign debt resulted in ongoing volatility in the foreign exchange markets  and we have consequentially assumed a hypothetical 
table of contents change in foreign exchange rates against the us dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of december  and interest rate sensitive financial instruments our investment portfolio of available for sale debt securities at december  and was comprised of us treasury securities and other government obligations  corporate debt securities  mortgage and asset backed securities  money market mutual funds  and other short term interest bearing securities  composed principally of commercial paper 
the fair value of our investment portfolio of debt securities was billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a basis point change in interest rates 
applying a duration model  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates at december  and  would not have resulted in a material effect on the fair values of these securities on these dates 
in addition  a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates at december  and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year 
as of december  we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of billion and a fair value of billion 
as of december  we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of billion and a fair value of billion 
our outstanding debt at december  and was comprised entirely of debt with fixed interest rates 
changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense or cash flows on fixed rate debt 
changes in interest rates would  however  affect the fair values of fixed rate debt 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates at december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately billion in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in interest rates relative to the interest rates at december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately million in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on this date 
to achieve a desired mix of fixed and floating interest rate debt  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements  which qualify and have been designated as fair value hedges  for certain of our fixed rate debt with notional amounts totaling billion and billion at december  and  respectively 
these derivative contracts effectively convert a fixed rate interest coupon to a floating libor based coupon over the life of the respective note 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates at december  and  would have resulted in a million and million  respectively  reduction in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements on these dates and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year 
foreign currency sensitive instruments our operating results are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to foreign currencies  predominately the euro  as a result of the sale of our products in foreign markets 
increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign exchange rates are offset partially by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses 
to further reduce our net exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations  we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts 
we enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions 
as of december  we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts  primarily euro based  with notional amounts of billion and million  respectively 
as of december  we had open foreign currency forward and options contracts  primarily euro based  with notional amounts of billion and million  respectively 
as of december  the net unrealized gains and at december  the net unrealized losses on these contracts were not material 
with regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open at december   a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december  would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately 
table of contents million on this date and  in the ensuing year  a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately million 
with regard to contracts that were open at december  a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december  would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately million on this date and  in the ensuing year  a reduction in income and cash flows of approximately million 
also at december  and  we had open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts totaling million and million  respectively  that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes 
these contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses at december  and with regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open at december  and  a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates compared with the us dollar relative to exchange rates at december  and  would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts on these dates of million and million  respectively  and would not result in a material effect on the related income or cash flows in the respective ensuing year 
the analysis above does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions or on assets and liabilities that these foreign currency sensitive instruments were designed to offset 
market price sensitive instruments as of december  and  we were also exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments  which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives 
these investments are generally in small capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry sector 
price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio at december  and was not material 
counterparty credit risks our financial instruments  including derivatives  are subject to counterparty credit risk which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement 
we attempt to mitigate that risk through credit monitoring procedures
