business outlook for  we look to continue to enhance our position as a leading global manufacturer and supplier of high quality semiconductor products  and to continue to add other complementary product lines  such as power management and logic products  using our packaging technology capability 
in addition  in we expect to see continued improvements in demand and order rates over  increased production ramps of previous design wins at new customers and the introduction of new product applications for existing customers 
we expect our business to continue to benefit from the increasing demand in china  as we consider the china market a major growth driver for our business 
we expect all our manufacturing facilities to maintain full utilization  except in the first quarter of for our china operations where equipment utilization will be impacted by china labor shortages in the coastal region and fewer working days and the chinese new year holiday in february 
the success of our business depends  among other factors  on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets  which in turn affect our customers demand for our products  the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations  the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders and end user consumers demand for items containing our products in the end markets we serve 
we believe the long term outlook for our business remains generally favorable despite the recent volatility in the global economy and the equity and credit markets as we continue to execute on the strategy that has proven successful for us over the years 
although the current economy creates a more challenging environment for all businesses  we believe the decisive measures taken in response to the global economic downturn have properly positioned us for our recent return to a profitable growth model and that over the long term we are well positioned for future growth

in addition  during the first  second and third quarters of  gross profit margin increased due to improved product mix in north america and europe  which includes a favorable mix of higher margin new products  as well as increased capacity at our wafer fabrication facilities and generally stable average selling prices asp 
during the fourth quarter of  our business continued to benefit from continued ramp up of prior design wins and customer acceptance of our new product portfolio 
as described in business our strategy in part i  item of this annual report  the principal elements of our strategy include the following continue to rapidly introduce innovative discrete  logic and analog semiconductor products  expand our available market opportunities  maintain intense customer focus  enhance cost competitiveness  and pursue selective strategic acquisitions 
in implementing this strategy  the following factors have affected  and  we believe  will continue to affect  our results of operations for  we have seen increased demand for our products as compared to we have experienced pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the selling price for our standard products  and we expect future improvements in net income to result primarily from increases in sales volume and improvements in product mix as well as manufacturing cost reductions in order to offset any reduced asp of our products 
see risk factors we are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products  which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  which are based upon historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when delivery has occurred  when the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these elements are met when title to the products is passed to the buyers  which is generally when product is shipped to the customers 
generally  we recognize revenue upon shipment to manufacturers direct ship as well as upon sales to distributors using the sell in model  which is when product is shipped to the distributors point of purchase 
certain customers have limited rights of return and or are entitled to price adjustments on products held in their inventory or upon sale to their end customers 
we reduce net sales in the period of sale for estimates of product returns  distributor price adjustments and other allowances 
our reserve estimates are based upon historical data as well as projections of sales  distributor inventories  price adjustments  average selling prices and market conditions 
actual returns and adjustments could be significantly different from our estimates and provisions  resulting in an adjustment to net sales 
we record allowances reserves for the following items i ship and debit  which arise when we  from time to time based on market conditions  issue credit to certain distributors upon their shipments to their end customers  ii stock rotation  which are contractual obligations that permit certain distributors  twice a year  to return a portion of their inventory based on historical shipments 
table of contents to them in exchange for an equal and offsetting order  and iii price protection  which arise when market conditions cause average selling prices to decrease and we issue credit to certain distributors on their inventory 
ship and debit reserves are recorded as a reduction to net sales with a corresponding reduction to accounts receivable 
stock rotation reserves are recorded as a reduction to net sales with a corresponding reduction to cost of goods sold for the estimated cost of inventory that is expected to be returned 
price protection reserves are recorded as a reduction to net sales with a corresponding increase in accrued liabilities 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out method 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our inventory for obsolescence and slow moving items 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels  sales projections  and purchases by item  as well as raw material usage related to our manufacturing facilities 
if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value  we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our current estimates  an inventory adjustment may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax accounting requires that we evaluate net deferred tax assets by jurisdiction to determine if these assets will more likely than not be realized in the foreseeable future 
this test requires the consideration of the reversal of temporary differences between book and tax basis  the projection of our taxable income into future years and the use of tax planning strategies to determine if it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax assets 
this analysis requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
we are involved in various tax matters  some of whose outcome is uncertain 
for purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain i we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  ii technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position  and iii each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken 
a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based on its technical merits  and the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefits that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
goodwill and long lived assets goodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business 
we test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  on october  and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
the fair value of the reporting units was calculated using the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting units was calculated by estimating the present value of associated future cash flows 
under the market approach  the fair value was calculated using the guideline public company method and the mergers and acquisitions method 
we determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying value of units  thus indicating that the goodwill was not impaired as of october  we assess the impairment of certain long lived assets at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value using a discounted cash flow analysis 
share based compensation we use the black scholes merton model to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant 
the amount of compensation expense recognized using the black scholes merton model requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
the fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors  including the grant price  the expected future volatility  the expected term of the option and the risk free interest rate of the option 
the expected term and expected future volatility of the options require our judgment 
in addition  we are required to 
table of contents estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock options expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  share based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
restricted stock grants are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
fair value measurements fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
as such  fair value is a market based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an assets or liability 
fair value is based on a hierarchy of valuation techniques  which is determined on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable 
observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources  while unobservable inputs reflect our market assumptions 
these two types of inputs create a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows level quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets 
level quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active  and model derived valuations in which all significant inputs and significant value drivers are observable in active markets 
level valuations derived from valuation techniques in which one or more significant inputs or significant value drivers are unobservable 
our defined benefit plan assets are valued under methods of fair value 
all of the securities held by the plan are publicly traded and highly liquid 
therefore  the majority of the securities are valued under level and one security is valued under level using quoted prices for identical or similar securities 
defined benefit plan we maintain a pension plan covering certain of our employees in the uk and germany 
for financial reporting purposes  the net pension and supplemental retirement benefit obligations and the related periodic pension costs are calculated based upon  among other things  assumptions of the discount rate for plan obligations  estimated return on pension plan assets and mortality rates 
these obligations and related periodic costs are measured using actuarial techniques and assumptions 
the projected unit credit method is the actuarial cost method used to compute the pension liabilities and related expenses 
see fair value measurements above in regard to pension plan assets 
contingencies from time to time  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
based on information available  we evaluate the likelihood of potential outcomes 
we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 
in addition  we do not accrue for estimated legal fees and other directly related costs as they are expensed as incurred 
convertible senior notes our notes may be settled for cash upon conversion 
as such  we allocated a portion of the proceeds received from the issuance of the notes between a liability and equity component by determining the fair value of the liability component using our nonconvertible borrowing rate 
the effective rate of the liability component was determined by obtaining a comparable yield for nonconvertible notes with terms and conditions comparable to our notes as of the date of issuance 
the difference between the proceeds of the notes and the fair value of the liability component was recorded as a discount on the debt with a corresponding offset to additional paid in capital 
the resulting debt discount is amortized as additional non cash interest expense  which we refer to as amortization of debt discount  over the expected life of the notes using the effective interest method

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily in asia and europe 
our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have a material adverse impact upon our financial results 
certain of our assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  and liabilities exist in non us dollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
these currencies are principally the chinese yuan  the taiwanese dollar and the british pound sterling and  to a lesser extent  the japanese yen  the euro and the hong kong dollar 
in the future  we may enter into hedging arrangements designed to mitigate foreign currency fluctuations 
see risk factors we are subject to foreign currency risk as a result of our international operations 
in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information 
effect on reporting income certain of our subsidiaries have a functional currency that differs from the currencies in which some of their expenses are denominated 
our income and expenses are based on a mix of currencies and a decline in one currency relative to the other currencies could adversely affect our results of operations 
furthermore  our results of operations are reported in us dollars  which is our reporting currency 
in the event the us dollar weakens against a foreign currency  we will experience a currency transaction loss  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
if a foreign currency were to weaken or strengthen by against the us dollar  we would experience currency transaction gain or loss of approximately million per quarter 
foreign currency transaction risk we also are subject to foreign currency risk arising from intercompany transactions that are expected to be settled in cash in the near term where the cash balances are held in denominations other than our subsidiaries functional currency 
if exchange rates weaken against the functional currency  we would incur a remeasurement gain in the value of the cash balances  and if the exchange rates strengthen against the functional currency  we would incur a remeasurement loss in the value of the cash balances  assuming the net monetary asset balances remained constant 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will generally depend on the size and type of transaction  the size and currencies of the net monetary assets and the changes in the exchange rates associated with these currencies 
if the chinese yuan  the taiwanese dollar  the euro and the british pound sterling were to weaken or strengthen by against the us dollar  we would experience currency transaction gain or loss of approximately million 
net foreign exchange transaction gains or losses are included in other income and expense 
foreign currency translation risk when our foreign subsidiaries books are maintained in their functional currency  fluctuations in foreign currencies impact the amount of total assets and liabilities that we report for our foreign subsidiaries upon the translation of these amounts into us dollars for reporting purposes 
all elements of the subsidiaries financial statements  except for stockholders equity accounts  are translated using a currency exchange rate 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date 
income and expense accounts denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the weighted average exchange rate during the period presented 
resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets  which are accumulated in this account until sale or liquidation of the foreign entity investment  at which time they are reported as adjustments to the gain or loss on sale of investment 
foreign currency denominated defined benefit plans we have a contributory defined benefit plan that covers certain employees in the uk and germany 
the defined benefit plan is closed to new entrants and frozen with respect to future benefit accruals 
the retirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of each eligible employee 
december is our annual measurement date and on measurement date  defined benefit plan assets are determined based on fair value 
defined benefit plan assets consist primarily of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability 
the net pension and supplemental retirement benefit obligations and the related periodic costs are based on  among other things  assumptions of the discount rate  estimated return on plan assets and mortality rates 
these obligations and related periodic costs are measured using actuarial techniques and assumptions 
the projected unit credit method is the actuarial cost method used to compute the pension liabilities and related expenses 

table of contents as of december   the plan was underfunded and a liability of million was reflected in our consolidated financial statements as a noncurrent liability 
the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income was a net loss of million 
if the british pound sterling were to weaken or strengthen by against the us dollar  we would experience currency translation liability decrease or increase of approximately million 
the weighted average discount rate assumption used to determine benefit obligations as of december  was 
a increase decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the net period benefit cost for the year would reduce annual benefit cost by million 
a increase decrease in the discount rate used to calculate the year end projected benefit obligation would increase decrease the year end projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
the expected return on plan assets is determined based on historical and expected future returns of the various assets classes and as such  each increase decrease in the expected rate of return assumption would increase decrease the net period benefit cost by approximately million 
the asset value of the defined benefit plan has been volatile in recent years due primarily to wide fluctuations in the uk equity markets and bond markets 
see risk factors due to the recent fluctuations in the united kingdom s equity markets and bond markets  changes in actuarial assumptions for our defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plan s asset value  require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information 
interest rate risk we have credit facilities with financial institutions in the us  asia and europe as well as other debt instruments with interest rates equal to libor or similar indices plus a negotiated margin 
a rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense 
as a matter of policy  we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
as of december   our outstanding principal debt under our interest bearing credit agreements was million  including million principal amount of convertible notes with a fixed interest rate of 
based on an increase or decrease in interest rates by for the year on our credit facilities  which currently have no outstanding borrowings  our annual interest rate expense would increase or decrease by approximately million 
political risk we have a significant portion of our assets in mainland china  taiwan and the uk the possibility of political conflict between the any of these countries or with the us could have a material adverse impact upon our ability to transact business through these important business channels and to generate profits 
see risk factors risks related to our international operations in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information 
inflation risk inflation did not have a material effect on net sales or net income in fiscal year a significant increase in inflation could affect future performance 
credit risk the success of our business depends  among other factors  on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets  which in turn affect our customers demand for our products  the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations  the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders and end user consumers demand for items containing our products in the end markets we serve 
we provide credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and perform ongoing credit evaluations  while at times providing extended terms 
we believe that our exposure to concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables is largely mitigated by dispersion of our customers over various geographic areas  operating primarily in electronics manufacturing and distribution 
we believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risks
