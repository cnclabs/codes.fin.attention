commitments of million mature on june   and commitments of million mature on july  the company does not plan to renew the million bank line 
commercial paper outstanding amounted to million at december   compared with million a year earlier 
the company s short term financing requirements are seasonal and typically peak at december because of questar gas s gas purchasing requirements 
the company believes the credit commitments are adequate for its working capital and short term financing requirements during in june  questar entered into a lease agreement for a new headquarters building that is being constructed 
the lease term is years beginning when the building is ready for occupancy  which is expected in early initial lease payments are million per year compared to million per year under its current building lease 
questar expects to account for this lease as a capital lease 
the company s lease on its existing headquarters building will expire at that time 
the company increased its dividend to common shareholders subsequent to the spinoff of qep because of the change in the company s risk and return profile 
the company expects to continue to increase its common dividend in the future as a result of visibility and growth in earnings and cash flows

the company consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position 
the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management 
gas and oil reserves gas and oil reserve estimates require significant judgments in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  production history  and economic assumptions relating to commodity prices  production costs  severance and other taxes  capital expenditures and remediation costs 
the subjective judgments and variances in data for various fields make these estimates less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
see note to the financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report for more information on the company estimated proved reserves 
successful efforts accounting for gas and oil operations the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for cost of service gas and oil activities 
under this method  the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties  successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs  the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs are expensed 
costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred 
capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves 
capitalized development and exploratory well costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves 
the calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement  surface restoration and property abandonment costs  net of estimated equipment salvage values 
other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants 
a gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned  or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected 
revenue recognition questar gas estimates revenues on a calendar basis even though bills are sent to customers on a cycle basis throughout the month 
the company estimates unbilled revenues for the period from the date meters are read to the end of the month  using usage history and weather information 
approximately one half month of revenues is estimated in any period 
the gas costs and other variable costs are recorded on the same basis to ensure proper matching of revenues and expenses 
questar gas s tariff provides for monthly adjustments to customer bills to approximate the impact of normal temperatures on non gas revenues 
questar gas estimates the weather normalization adjustment for the unbilled revenue each month 
the weather normalization adjustment is evaluated each month and reconciled on an annual basis in the summer to agree with the amount billed to customers 
in  the pscu approved the cet to promote energy conservation 
under the cet  questar gas non gas revenues are decoupled from the volume of gas used by customers 
the tariff specifies a margin per customer for each month with differences to be deferred and recovered from customers or refunded to customers through periodic rate adjustments 
these adjustments are limited to of non gas revenues 
rate regulation regulatory agencies establish rates for the storage  transportation  distribution and sale of natural gas 
the regulatory agencies also regulate  among other things  the extension and enlargement or abandonment of jurisdictional natural gas facilities 
regulation is intended to permit the recovery  through rates  of the cost of service  including a return on investment 
questar gas and questar pipeline follow accounting standards on regulated operations that require the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities by companies subject to cost based regulation 
the ferc  pscu and pscw have accepted the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities 
employee benefit plans the company has defined benefit pension  postretirement medical and life insurance plans covering a majority of its employees 
employees hired after june   do not participate in the defined benefit pension plan and employees hired after december   do not participate in the postretirement medical plan 
the calculation of the company expense and liability associated with its benefit plans requires the use of assumptions that the company deems to be critical 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expenses and liabilities and actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
independent consultants hired by the company use actuarial models to calculate estimates of pension and postretirement benefits expense 
the models use key factors such as mortality estimations  liability discount rates  long term rates of return on investments  rates of compensation increases  amortized gain or loss from investments and medical cost trend rates 
management formulates assumptions based on market indicators and advice from consultants 
the company believes that the liability discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on benefit plan assets are critical assumptions 
the assumed liability discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled and considers the rates of return available on a portfolio of high quality  fixed income investments 
the company discounted its future pension liabilities using rates of as of december   and as of december  a decrease in the discount rate would increase the company estimated annual qualified pension expense by about million 
the expected long term rate of return on benefit plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested for purposes of paying pension benefits 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year giving consideration to the benefit plan investment mix and historical and forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
the expected long term rate of return determined by the company was as of january   and january  benefit plan expense typically increases as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets decreases 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return causes an approximate million increase in the qualified pension expense 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk wexpro operations are subject to various government controls and regulation at the federal  state and local levels 
wexpro must obtain permits to drill and produce  maintain bonding requirements to drill and operate wells  submit and implement spill prevention plans  and file notices relating to the presence  use  and release of specified contaminants incidental to gas and oil production 
wexpro is also subject to various conservation matters  including the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units  the number of wells that may be drilled in a unit and the unitization or pooling of gas and oil properties 
in addition  the utah division of public utilities has oversight responsibility and retains an outside reservoir engineering consultant and a financial auditor to assess the prudence of wexpro activities 
questar pipeline s primary market risk exposures arise from changes in demand for transportation and storage services and competition from other pipelines 
the demand for transportation and storage services will vary based on the market s expectations about future volumes of natural gas likely to be produced in the basins served by questar pipeline and changes in market demand for natural gas 
on some portions of its pipeline system the company faces the risk that it will not be successful in re contracting capacity under favorable terms once existing contracts expire 
revenue may be reduced if ngl market prices or volumes decline 
questar gas s primary market risk exposures arise from changes in demand for natural gas and competition from other energy sources 
the demand for natural gas will vary based on economic conditions  conservation efforts and prices 
the temperature adjusted usage per residential customer has decreased due to more energy efficient appliances and homes  and behavior changes in response to higher natural gas prices 
the economic impact of this decline in usage per customer has been somewhat offset by the addition of new customers and the cet 
credit risk questar pipeline requests credit support  such as letters of credit and cash deposits  from companies that pose unfavorable credit risks 
all companies posing such concerns were current on their accounts at december  questar pipeline largest customers include questar gas  rockies express pipeline  eog resources  xto energy  wyoming interstate pipeline  encana marketing and pacificorp 
questar gas requires deposits from customers that pose unfavorable credit risks 
no single customer accounted for a significant portion of revenue in interest rate risk the fair value of fixed rate debt is subject to change as interest rates fluctuate 
the company ability to borrow and the rates quoted by lenders can be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets 
the company had  million of fixed rate long term debt with a fair value of  million at december   compared to million of fixed rate long term debt with a fair value of million at december  if interest rates had declined  fair value would increase to  million in and million in the fair value calculations do not represent the cost to retire the debt securities 
climate change risk federal and state courts and administrative agencies are considering the scope and scale of climate change regulation under various laws pertaining to the environment  energy use and development  and greenhouse gas emissions 
it is likely that congress will enact legislation to regulate greenhouse gas emissions in the future  though not in the environmental protection agency epa has adopted regulations for the measurement and reporting of greenhouse gases emitted from combustion at large facilities emitting more than  metric tons year of carbon dioxide 

equivalent beginning in the first report is to be filed with the epa by march  reporting under this regulation will be expanded to include measurement and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions attributed to methane venting and leaking in this regulation will affect all questar subsidiaries in  and will require measurement and monitoring in the natural gas producing basins in which wexpr o operates  as well as in questar pipeline s compressor stations  storage fields  and processing facilities 
questar gas will be responsible for reporting combustion emissions for all of its customers  as well as for measurement and monitoring of gate station methane emissions 
epa s prevention of significant deterioration and title v greenhouse gas tailoring rule  which went into effect january   regulates greenhouse gases as a clean air act pollutant 
this rule will be phased in to regulate greenhouse gas at large new sources or at existing sources undergoing major modifications 
there are efforts in the current congress to undo the tailoring rule  it is too early to predict whether these efforts will be successful 
analysis of near term capital projects indicates that these permitting regulations will not inhibit development or expansion of questar services  unless epa reduces thresholds in the future 
while future climate change regulation is likely  it is too early to predict how this regulation will affect questar business  operations  or financial results 
if forthcoming regulations recognize that use of natural gas in high efficiency residential  commercial  transportation  industrial  and electricity generation applications is essential to lower us greenhouse gas emissions  use of natural gas in these applications will increase 
similarly  natural gas will be essential in ensuring electrical grid reliability as reliance on intermittent renewable energy increases in the future 
use of natural gas as an alternative transportation fuel continues to grow  with questar actively involved in expanding refueling infrastructure 
on the other hand  federal regulation of carbon dioxide could increase the price of natural gas  restrict access to or the use of natural gas  and or reduce natural gas demand 
federal  state  and local governments may pass laws mandating the use of alternati ve energy sources  such as wind  solar  and geothermal energy 
the increased use of alternative energy could reduce the future demand for natural gas 
it is uncertain whether questar operations and properties  all located in the rocky mountains  are exposed to possible physical risks  such as severe weather patterns due to climate change  as a result of man made greenhouse gases 
however  management does not believe that such physical risks are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company financial condition or results of operations
