b management considers funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties  real estate depreciation and amortization  and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities  including certain noncontrolling interests  which are convertible into common shares 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and excluding depreciation  ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
c includes discontinued operations 
d excludes apartment homes owned in joint ventures

table of contents executive summary we are primarily engaged in the ownership  management  development  acquisition and construction of multifamily apartment communities 
as of december   we owned interests in  operated  or were developing multifamily properties comprising  apartment homes across the united states as detailed in the following property portfolio table 
in addition  we own other land parcels we may develop into multifamily apartment communities 
the us economy has experienced a significant recession 
record levels of job losses and higher unemployment rates negatively impacted our business  particularly in the latter half of through the first quarter of  when we experienced declines in both rental rates and occupancy levels 
despite unemployment rates remaining at high levels  our results for the most recent three quarters reflect sequential rental revenue growth as well as an increase in rental revenue growth for the three months ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily due to improvements in rental rates and slight improvements in average occupancy levels 
we believe these improvements may be due in part to the continued decline in home ownership rates and the limited supply of new rental housing 
we expect improvements in rental rates and occupancy to continue in and believe sustained revenue growth will depend on  among other things  the timing and extent of employment growth  supply levels of new multifamily housing  and the continuation of the decline in home ownership rates 
in  we acquired three multifamily properties  totaling units  for an aggregate of approximately million on behalf of one of our discretionary investment funds in which we have a ownership interest 
additionally  we restructured three of our joint ventures  which collectively own an aggregate of  units  resulting in our acquiring a controlling ownership interest in each joint venture 
during the second half of  we began construction on two development projects  comprised of approximately units  initial occupancy is expected in the last half of as of december   we intend to incur approximately million of additional costs on these projects 
we expect to fund these amounts through available cash balances and draws upon our unsecured line of credit 
we expect to start several additional development projects currently held in our development pipeline in and are evaluating additional development projects to commence during fiscal year and beyond 
during the fourth quarter of  we received net proceeds of approximately million and recognized a gain of approximately million from the sale of two operating properties  containing  apartment homes to unaffiliated third parties 
subject to market conditions  we intend to continue to look for opportunities to develop and acquire existing communities through the funds  expand our development pipeline  and complete selective dispositions 
we also intend to continue to focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity positions by generating positive cash flows from operations  reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios  and controlling overhead costs 
we intend to meet our liquidity requirements through available cash balances  cash flows generated from operations  draws on our unsecured credit facility  proceeds from property dispositions and secured mortgage notes  and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and no balances outstanding on our million unsecured line of credit 
we have approximately million of debt maturities in  excluding scheduled principal amortizations 
we believe we are well positioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to cover near term debt maturities and new development funding requirements 
we will  however  continue to assess and take further actions where prudent to meet our objectives and capital requirements

the decline in average rental rates was due to the continuation of the recession through the first quarter of  offset by improving rental rates and slight improvements in average occupancy levels for the most recent three quarters which we believe is due in part to the continued decline in home ownership rates and the limited supply of new rental housing

table of contents funds from operations ffo management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties  real estate depreciation and amortization  and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities  including certain noncontrolling interests  which are convertible into common shares 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and depreciation  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  we believe ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income attributable to common shareholders as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income attributable to common shareholders as an indication of our operating performance 
additionally  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 
reconciliations of net income attributable to common shareholders to diluted ffo for the years ended december are as follows in thousands funds from operations net income loss attributable to common shareholders real estate depreciation and amortization  including discontinued operations adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures gain on sale of properties and discontinued operations  net of taxes income loss allocated to noncontrolling interests funds from operations diluted weighted average shares basic incremental shares issuable from assumed conversion of common share options and share awards granted common units weighted average shares diluted includes an million and million impairment associated with land development activities for the years ended december  and  respectively 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources financial condition and sources of liquidity we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility  which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available 
we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where practicable  managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt  maintaining what management believes to be conservative coverage ratios  and using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and common and preferred equity 
our interest expense coverage ratio  net of capitalized interest  was approximately times for each of the years ended december    and our interest expense coverage ratio is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses  non property income  other expenses  income from discontinued operations  after adding back depreciation  amortization  and interest expense from both continuing and discontinued operations 
this ratio is a method for calculating the amount of operating cash flows available to cover interest expense 
at december    and  approximately   and  respectively  of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered 
our weighted average maturity of debt  including our line of credit  was years at december  for the longer term  we intend to continue to focus on strengthening our capital and liquidity position by generating positive cash flows from operations  reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios  and controlling overhead costs 
our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
other sources include available cash balances  the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other short term borrowings  proceeds from dispositions of properties and other investments  secured mortgage debt  and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 
we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash needs during including normal recurring operating expenses  current debt service requirements  recurring capital expenditures  initial funding of property developments  acquisitions  joint venture investments  and notes receivable  and the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the code 
factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to volatility in capital and credit markets  sources of financing  our ability to complete asset sales  the effect our debt level and decreases in credit ratings could have on our costs of funds  and our ability to access capital markets 
cash flows certain sources and uses of cash  such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures  and repurchases of debt and common shares are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based upon  among other factors  market conditions 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to approximately million during the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to lower interest expense and changes in operating accounts 
the increase was partially offset by declines in property net operating income in as compared to net cash provided by investing activities during the year ended december  totaled approximately million as compared to net cash used by investing activities of approximately million during the year ended december  cash outflows for property development  acquisition  and capital improvements were approximately million during as compared to approximately million during this decrease was due to the timing of completions of communities in our development pipeline and a reduction in construction and development activity in as compared to cash inflows from sales of properties including land and discontinued operations were approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  additionally  cash outflows for investments in joint ventures were million for the year ended december  as compared to million in the decrease in cash outflows for investments in joint ventures in as compared to was primarily a result of our million equity investment in one of our joint ventures during the third quarter 
table of contents net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million during the year ended december  primarily as a result of the repayment of maturing outstanding unsecured notes payable of approximately million  repayment of approximately million of secured notes assumed in connection with obtaining controlling interests in three joint ventures and distributions paid to common shareholders  perpetual preferred unit holders  and noncontrolling interest holders of approximately million 
the cash outflows were partially offset by cash receipts of approximately million relating to proceeds received from the sale of approximately million common shares throughout fiscal year under our atm share offering program 
cash outflows were further offset by decreases in accounts receivable from affiliates of approximately million relating to proceeds received from participant withdrawals from our deferred compensation plans and approximately million for proceeds received from secured notes payable relating to a secured credit agreement for a newly consolidated joint venture and million for advances under a construction loan for one of our communities completing construction during net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million during the year ended december  during the year ended december   we used a total of approximately million of cash to repay outstanding notes payable consisting of approximately million of outstanding notes payable stemming from our april tender offer  the early retirement of outstanding debt consisting of approximately million of secured notes  and approximately million of senior unsecured notes 
the remaining outstanding notes payable payments were primarily for maturing secured and unsecured notes payable of approximately million  and payments of all remaining amounts outstanding on our unsecured line of credit 
also in  million was used for distributions paid to common shareholders  perpetual preferred unit holders  and noncontrolling interest holders 
the cash outflows were offset by cash receipts of million from a secured credit facility entered into during the second quarter  approximately million of cash receipts from secured notes relating to a construction loan for a consolidated joint venture and net proceeds of approximately million from the completion of our equity offering in may financial flexibility in august  we entered into a million unsecured credit facility  with the option to increase this credit facility to million  which matures in august and may be extended at our option to august this facility replaces our million unsecured credit facility which was scheduled to mature in january interest rate spreads float on a margin based on libor and are subject to change as our credit ratings change 
advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates  or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates 
these bid rate loans have terms of days or less and may not exceed the lesser of million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit 
the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations  all of which we are in compliance 
our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to million in letters of credit 
while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line of credit  it does reduce the amount available 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million  leaving approximately million available under our unsecured line of credit 
we currently have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the sec which allows us to offer  from time to time  an unlimited amount of common shares  preferred shares  debt securities  or warrants 
our declaration of trust provides we may issue up to million shares of beneficial interest  consisting of million common shares and million preferred shares 
as of december   we had approximately million common shares outstanding  net of treasury shares and shares held in our deferred compensation arrangements  and no preferred shares outstanding 
in march  we announced the creation of our atm share offering program through which we may  but have no obligation to  sell common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to million  in amounts and at times as we determine  into the existing trading market at current market prices as well as through negotiated transactions 
actual sales from time to time may depend on a variety of factors including  among others  market conditions  the trading price of our common shares  and determinations of the appropriate sources of funding for us 
as of the day of this filing  we had common shares having an aggregate offering price of up to million remaining under the atm program 
we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody s and standard and poor s  which are currently baa and bbb  respectively  with stable outlooks  as well as by our ability to borrow on a secured basis from various institutions including banks  fannie mae  freddie mac  or life insurance companies 
however  we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 

table of contents future cash requirements and contractual obligations one of our principal long term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt  including any future borrowings under our unsecured line of credit 
during  approximately million of unsecured debt  excluding scheduled principal amortizations  are scheduled to mature 
see note  notes payable  of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scheduled maturities 
additionally  we intend to incur approximately million of additional capital expenditures on our current development projects and we expect to fund these amounts through available cash balances and draws on our unsecured line of credit 
we intend to meet our near term liquidity requirements through available cash balances  cash flows generated from operations  draws on our unsecured credit facility  proceeds from property dispositions and secured mortgage notes  and the use of debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 
in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute annual dividends to our shareholders equal to a minimum of of our reit taxable income  computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains 
in december  we announced our board of trust managers had declared a dividend distribution of per share to our common shareholders of record as of december  the dividend was subsequently paid on january  we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of common operating partnership units 
when aggregated with previous dividends  this distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annual dividend rate of per share or unit for the year ended december  the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december  in millions total thereafter debt maturities interest payments non cancelable lease payments postretirement benefit obligations includes scheduled principal amortizations 
includes contractual interest payments for our senior unsecured notes  medium term notes  and secured notes 
interest payments on hedged loans were calculated based on the interest rates effectively fixed by the interest rate swap agreements 
the interest payments on certain secured notes with floating interest rates were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of december  or the most recent practicable date 
off balance sheet arrangements the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured  third party debt 
we have guaranteed no more than our proportionate interest  totaling approximately million  of two loans utilized for construction and development activities for our joint ventures 
we are also committed to additional funding under a mezzanine loan provided to one joint venture and our commitment to fund additional amounts under this mezzanine loan was an aggregate of approximately million at december  inflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to fifteen months 
in an inflationary environment  we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases 
we believe the short term nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date  and the amounts of revenues and expenses recognized during the reporting period 
these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting estimates 
for a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents use of estimates 
in the application of gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions which affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  results of operations during the reporting periods  and related disclosures 
our more significant estimates include estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying values of our real estate assets  estimates related to the valuation of our investments in joint ventures  and estimates and assumptions used to determine the entity with the power to direct activities that most significantly impacts economic performance of variable interest entities 
these estimates are based on historical experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
principles of consolidation 
we may enter into various joint venture agreements with unrelated third parties to hold or develop real estate assets 
we must determine for each of these joint ventures whether to consolidate the entity or account for our investment under the equity or cost basis of accounting 
investments acquired or created are continuously evaluated based on the accounting guidance relating to variable interest entities vies  which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary 
if the investment is determined not to be a vie  then the investment is evaluated for consolidation primarily using a voting interest model under the remaining consolidation guidance relating to real estate entities 
if we are the general partner in a limited partnership  or manager of a limited liability company  we also consider the consolidation guidance relating to the rights of limited partners non managing members to assess whether any rights held by the limited partners overcome the presumption of control by us 
we evaluate our accounting for investments on a quarterly basis or when a reconsideration event as defined in gaap with respect to our investments occurs 
the analysis required to identify vies and primary beneficiaries is complex and requires substantial management judgment 
accordingly  we believe the decisions made to choose an appropriate accounting framework are critical 
asset impairment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets 
we consider projected future discounted and undiscounted cash flows  trends  strategic decisions regarding future development plans  and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist 
when impairment exists  the long lived asset is adjusted to its fair value 
while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding a number of factors  including market rents  economic conditions  and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates 
in estimating fair value  management uses appraisals  management estimates  and discounted cash flow calculations that maximize inputs from a marketplace participant s perspective 
in addition  we evaluate our investments in joint ventures and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value of our investment  we will record an impairment charge 
the value of our properties under development depends on market conditions  including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of demand for multifamily communities 
we have reviewed market trends and other marketplace information and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses 
due to  among other factors  the judgment and assumptions applied in the impairment analyses and the fact limited market information regarding the value of comparable land exists at this time  it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 
we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets  properties under development  and land is currently recoverable 
however  if market conditions deteriorate or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value calculations  we may need to take material charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets 
any such material non cash charges would have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
cost capitalization 
real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges 
carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development 
capitalized interest is generally based on our weighted average interest rate of our unsecured debt 
transaction costs associated with the acquisition of real estate assets are expensed 
expenditures directly related to the development and improvement of real estate assets are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized 
all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed 
upon substantial completion of the apartment homes  the total cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land  respectively 
included in capitalized costs are management s estimates of indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities 
the estimates used by management require judgment  and accordingly we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks inherent in our operations 
these risks generally arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
we believe our primary market risk exposure relates to interest rate risk 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the table below provides information about our assets and our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  and december  december  weighted weighted weighted weighted average average average average amount maturity interest of amount maturity interest of in millions in years rate total in millions in years rate total fixed rate debt variable rate debt includes a million term loan entered into in and million of a construction loan entered into in which are effectively fixed by the use of an interest rate swap see discussion below 
we have historically used variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline 
to the extent we utilize our revolving credit facility thereby increasing our variable rate indebtedness  our exposure to increases in interest rates will also increase 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income attributable to common shareholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
holding other variables constant  a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the net income attributable to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt  excluding debt effectively fixed by interest rate swap agreements described below  would be approximately million  holding all other variables constant 
we currently use interest rate hedges to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable indebtedness  not for trading or speculative purposes 
under the hedge agreements we agree to pay a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate  and the counterparty agrees to pay us the interest rate that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index 
as of december   the effect of our hedge agreements was to fix the interest rate on approximately million of our variable rate debt 
had the hedge agreements not been in place during  our annual interest costs would have been approximately million lower  based on balances and reported interest rates through the year as the variable interest rates were less than the effective interest rates on the associated hedge agreements 
additionally  if the variable interest rates on this debt had been basis points higher through and the hedge agreements not been in place  our annual interest cost would have been approximately million higher 
derivative financial instruments expose us to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counterparties under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreements 
we believe we minimize our credit risk on these transactions by dealing with major  creditworthy financial institutions 
as part of our on going control procedures  we monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and our exposure to any single entity  thus minimizing credit risk concentration 
we believe the likelihood of realized losses from counterparty non performance is remote
