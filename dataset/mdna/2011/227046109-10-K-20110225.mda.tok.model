financial highlights during the year ended december   revenues increased million  or  compared to the same period in  as a result of stronger sales in each of our geographic operating segments 
diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  improved to compared to diluted losses per share of during the same period in  primarily due to the following improved global economic conditions  stronger global demand for our products as a result of market acceptance of our expanded product line and more effective marketing and merchandising programs  on going investment in the growth of our retail and internet channels which have historically yielded higher margins  and the residual impact of our turnaround strategy as further described below 
turnaround strategy having experienced rapid revenue growth and difficulty meeting demand for our footwear products since inception  our revenue growth moderated in the first half of and decreased through the balance of and through the year ended december  during this time  our total revenues declined from million in the year ended december  to million during the year 
table of contents ended december  accordingly  we implemented a turnaround strategy in  which continued through  aimed at aligning production and distribution capacities with revised demand projections  reducing costs and streamlining processes 
as a result  we consolidated our global manufacturing facilities and distribution centers  reduced warehouse and office space  cut global workforce by and reduced other discretionary spending 
during  we sold excess discontinued and impaired product inventories  much of which had been written down in to a level that we had considered realizable  at prices substantially higher than previously estimated 
the consequential net effect of these sales was accretive to our gross profit in as a result of these and other actions taken as part of our turnaround strategy  we achieved improved year over year gross margin in as well as improved operating margin and net loss  despite weakened economic conditions during the benefits of our turnaround strategy continued through the year ended december   during which sales of discontinued and impaired product were at more normal levels 
presentation of reportable segments we have three reportable segments americas  europe and asia 
we also have an other segment category which aggregates insignificant operating segments that do not meet the reportable threshold 
each of our reportable segments derives its revenues from the sale of footwear  apparel and accessories 
the composition of our reportable segments is consistent with that used by our codm to evaluate performance and allocate resources 
during the fourth quarter of  we changed the internal segment reports used by our codm to separately illustrate performance metrics of certain operating segments which provide manufacturing support  located in mexico and italy 
these operating segments make up our other segment category 
segment information for all periods presented has been restated to reflect this change 
segment operating income loss is the primary measure used by our codm to evaluate segment operating performance and to decide how to allocate resources to segments 
segment performance evaluation is based primarily on segment results without allocating corporate expenses  or indirect general  administrative and other expenses 
segment profits or losses of our reportable segments include adjustments to eliminate intersegment profit or losses on intersegment sales 
segment operating income loss is defined as operating income before asset impairment charges and restructuring costs not included in cost of sales 
segment assets consist of cash  accounts receivable and inventory as these assets make up the asset information used by the codm 
revenues of each of our reportable segments represent sales to external customers 
revenues of the other segment are made up of intersegment sales only 
see note operating segments and geographic information in the accompanying notes to the financial statements for further details 
results of operations our turnaround strategy as previously discussed had a considerable impact on our operating results for the years ended december   and the following summarizes specific significant items related to the implementation of this strategy as well as other material events which should be considered in evaluating the comparability of such results 
revenues and gross profit for the year ended december  were impacted by the effect of the sale of excess discontinued and impaired product inventories much of which had been written down in to a level that we had considered realizable at prices substantially higher than previously estimated 
the net effect of these sales accretive to our gross profit during the year ended december  was million 
although we were able to sell million of this impaired product at higher than anticipated price levels  such sales were deeply discounted and consequently drove down average selling price and revenues in during and  sales of discontinued and impaired product were at more normal levels given seasonality and historical fluctuations in our business 

table of contents cost of sales and selling  general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by million due to our stock option tender offer the tender offer 
in april  we offered to purchase stock options with exercise prices equal to or greater than per share for cash from certain eligible employees in order to restore the incentive value of our long term performance award programs and in response to the fact that the exercise prices of a substantial number of outstanding stock options held by our employees far exceeded the market price of our common stock 
as part of the tender offer  we repurchased million stock options from employees and non employee directors and recorded a charge of million related to previously unrecognized share based compensation expense for these tendered and cancelled options 
of this million charge  million was recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses and million was recorded to cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were negatively impacted by million due to an error in our calculation of stock based compensation expense for prior periods 
this error resulted in an accumulated million understatement of stock based compensation expense  with a corresponding understatement of additional paid in capital  of which million was partially offset as a consequence of adjustments made pursuant to the tender offer 
consequently  we recorded an additional million in stock based compensation during the fourth quarter of to correct the balance of this error 
we do not believe that these errors or related corrections are material to our previously issued historical consolidated financial statements for or our quarterly or annual results for revenues and gross profit for the year ended december  were impacted by historically high sales returns and allowances 
in  we received a substantial number of return and allowance requests from our wholesale customers which we believed were primarily due to wholesaler response to rapid declines in consumer spending on a macroeconomic level as a result of the global economic downturn as well as less than anticipated sell through during the spring summer season in we granted certain return requests and allowances to customers that we believed were strategically important to our ongoing business 
consequently  sales returns and allowances for the year ended december  were significantly higher than historical estimates 
however  we believed that the granting of return requests and allowances to customers in response to the severe economic downturn was strategically important to our business 
we experienced significant improvement in our sell through in the wholesale channel during and and do not expect to grant return requests and allowances to customers in the future to the extent that we did during during and  the implementation of our turnaround strategy resulted in significantly higher restructuring costs and asset impairment charges as we consolidated global distribution centers  warehouse and office space and assessed the useful life and carrying value recoverability of certain assets we no longer intended to utilize  including molds  tooling  equipment and other assets 
these costs decreased during as our turnaround strategy implementation came to an end 
the portions of restructuring and impairment related to manufacturing assets are recognized in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
the portions related to non product  non manufacturing assets are reflected in restructuring charges and asset impairment charges as appropriate  on the consolidated statements of operations

consumer direct channel revenues revenues from our consumer direct sales channels increased to of revenue during the year ended december  compared to during the same period in as consumer direct channel sales continue to grow as a percentage of our total sales  we expect to realize growth in total revenues and gross margin since these channels have historically achieved higher average selling prices than the wholesale channel 
retail channel revenues from our company operated retail locations increased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the same period in  which was driven by the expanded availability of product to our retail customer due to the increase in retail locations where we can better merchandise the full breadth and depth of our product line and improved pricing year over year

these increases were partially offset by revenue declines from our internet channel in asia where we saw a drop in demand due to prolonged cold weather and an increase in imitation products in the region  particularly in japan 
the internet channel enables us to showcase our entire product offering directly to the consumer  which we believe to be advantageous to us in terms of sales volume and brand awareness 
product revenue concentration revenues from non classic footwear models made up the majority of our revenues during the year ended december   as our classic models and core products defined below have become a smaller portion of our total revenue in recent quarters

impact on revenues due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations changes in average foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended december  increased revenues by million compared to the same period in we expect that sales in international markets in foreign currencies will continue to represent a substantial portion of our overall revenues 
accordingly  changes in foreign currency exchange rates could materially affect our overall revenues or the comparability of those revenues from period to period as a result of translating our financial statements into our reporting currency  the us dollar

wholesale channel revenues increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to the same period in  due to increased demand 

table of contents gross profit during the year ended december  gross profit increased million  or  compared to the same period in gross margin increased to during the year ended december  compared to the same period in these increases are primarily attributable to a increase in sales volume  a increase in average selling price and favorable shifts in product mix within the consumer direct channels toward higher margin products 
the increase is also attributable to a decrease of million in restructuring charges due to higher restructuring costs associated with the closures and consolidation our distribution spaces in the americas and europe segments 
additionally  we continue to increase shipments made directly from the factories to our wholesale customers and our retail channel which lower distribution costs 
we realized improvements in gross profit during as factory direct shipment volume increased 
offsetting these increases was the accretive effect of impaired unit sales that took place during as previously discussed 
the net effect of these sales during the year ended december  was million 
during  retail and internet sales continued to increase as a percentage of total revenue 
this trend contributed to higher gross margins as we were able to achieve a higher average selling price in these channels while many of the fixed costs associated with operating our company operated retail stores are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
also during  we sold a wide range of products which required additional materials  such as canvas  cloth lining and suede  and additional processes  such as stitching  to manufacture  thereby increasing our direct costs and lowering our gross margins on those products 
as we continue to expand our portfolio and non classic models become a larger portion of our business  we expect that our profit margins will be adversely affected 
impact on gross profit due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations changes in average foreign currency exchange rates during the year ended december  increased our gross profit by million compared to the same period in we expect that sales at subsidiary companies with functional currencies other than the us dollar will continue to generate a substantial portion of our overall gross profit

selling  general and administrative expenses and foreign currency transaction gains losses selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the same period in  primarily due to an increase of approximately million in salaries  rent and other retail related costs largely driven by the expansion of our retail sales channel and an increase of approximately million in costs related to our marketing campaign  which were partially offset by a decrease of million in share based compensation  million of which was due to the acceleration of share based compensation expense from the tender offer  and an increase of million gains on transactions denominated in foreign currencies

at december  and  we had issued and outstanding letters of credit of million and million  respectively  which were reserved against the borrowing base 
working capital as of december   accounts receivable increased million when compared to december   primarily due to higher sales in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth 
table of contents quarter of days sales outstanding improved slightly to at december  compared to at december  inventories increased million as of december  when compared to december   due to multiple factors including the growth associated with the addition of new retail locations  the addition of component raw material inventory  as we continue to manufacture more of our hybrid product which provides savings on costs incurred with importing these products from china  and a significant increase in order backlog 
capital assets during the years ended december  and  we had net capital expenditures of million and million  respectively 
the million increase in net capital expenditures was primarily due to ongoing investments in new retail stores as well as new molds and other tooling equipment related to new product manufacturing 
we have entered into various operating leases that require cash payments on a specified schedule 
over the next five years we are committed to make payments of approximately million related to our operating leases 
we plan to continue to enter into operating leases related to our retail stores 
we also continue to evaluate cost reduction opportunities 
our evaluation of cost reduction opportunities will include an evaluation of contracts for sponsorships  operating lease contracts and other contracts that require future minimum payments resulting in fixed operating costs 
any changes to these contracts may require early termination fees or other charges that could result in significant cash expenditures 
repatriation of cash we are a global business with operations in many different countries  which requires cash accounts to be held in various currencies 
the global market has recently experienced many fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which impacts our results of operations and cash positions 
the future fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our cash flows and capital resources 
cash balances held in foreign countries have additional restrictions and covenants associated with them  which adds increased strains on our liquidity and ability to timely access and transfer cash balances between entities 
we generally consider unremitted earnings of subsidiaries operating outside of the us to be indefinitely reinvested and it is not our current intent to change this position 
however  most of the cash held outside of the us could be repatriated to the us  but under current law  would be subject to us federal and state income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
in some countries  repatriation of certain foreign balances is restricted by local laws and could have adverse tax consequences if we were to move the cash to another country 
certain countries  including china  have monetary laws which may limit our ability to utilize cash resources in those countries for operations in other countries 
these limitations may affect our ability to fully utilize our cash resources for needs in the us or other countries and may adversely affect our liquidity 
as of december   we held million of our total million in cash in international locations 
this cash is primarily used for the ongoing operations of the business in the locations in which the cash is held 
of the million  million could potentially be restricted  as described above 
if the remaining million were to be repatriated to the us  we would be required to pay approximately million in international withholding taxes with no offsetting credit 
we believe that we have sufficient us net operating losses nols to absorb any future increases to us taxable income and therefore  us federal income tax brought about by potential cash repatriation up to the lesser of the total us nol balances or the current foreign subsidiaries earnings 
there are full valuation allowances on the nols that would be released to result in no tax effect or cash tax payments for the 
table of contents us up to the aforementioned limitation 
as of december   we anticipate repatriating approximately million of foreign subsidiary earnings in and the release of million in nol valuation allowances 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements in february  we renewed and amended our supply agreement with finproject srl which provides us the exclusive right to purchase certain raw materials used to manufacture our products 
the agreement also provides that we meet minimum purchase requirements to maintain exclusivity throughout the term of the agreement  which expires december  historically  the minimum purchase requirements have not been onerous and we do not expect them to become onerous in the future 
depending on the material purchased  pricing is either based on contracted price or is subject to quarterly reviews and fluctuates based on order volume  currency fluctuations and raw material prices 
pursuant to the agreement  we guarantee the payment for certain third party manufacturer purchases of these raw materials up to a maximum potential amount of million approximately million as of december   through a letter of credit that was issued to finproject srl 
the following table summarizes aggregate information about our contractual cash obligations as of december   excluding the guarantee and supply agreement mentioned above 
payments due by period thousands total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations inventory purchase obligations with third party manufacturers estimated liability for uncertain tax positions capital lease obligations minimum licensing royalties corporate sponsorships long term debt obligations total critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on the consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following discussion pertains to accounting policies management believes are most critical to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations that require management most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates related to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our estimates are based on a variety of factors  
table of contents including the length of time receivables are past due  economic trends and conditions affecting our customer base  significant one time events and historical write off experience 
specific provisions are recorded for individual receivables when we become aware of a customer inability to meet its financial obligations 
since we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates and we may experience changes in the amount of reserves we recognize for accounts receivable that we deem uncollectible 
if the financial condition of some of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
in the event we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate  we would record a credit or a charge to selling  general and administrative expenses in the period in which we made such a determination 
sales returns  allowances and discounts we record reductions to revenue for estimated customer returns  allowances and discounts 
our estimated sales returns and allowances are based on customer return history and actual outstanding returns yet to be received 
provisions for customer specific discounts based on contractual obligations with certain major customers are recorded as reductions to net sales 
we may accept returns from our wholesale and distributor customers  on an exception basis at the sole discretion of management for the purpose of stock re balancing to ensure that our products are merchandised in the proper assortments 
additionally  at the sole discretion of management  we may provide markdown allowances to key wholesale and distributor customers to facilitate the in channel markdown of products where we have experienced less than anticipated sell through 
we also record reductions to revenue for estimated customer credits as a result of price mark downs in certain markets 
fluctuations in our estimates for sales returns  allowances and discounts may be caused by many factors  including  but not limited to  fluctuations in our sales revenue  changes in demand for our products 
our judgment in determining these estimates is impacted by various factors including customer acceptance of our new styles  customer inventory levels  shipping delays or errors  known or suspected product defects  the seasonal nature of our products and macroeconomic factors affecting our customers 
since we cannot predict or control certain of these factors  the actual amounts of customer returns and allowances may differ from our estimates 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is determined using the moving average cost method 
at least quarterly  we evaluate our inventory for possible impairment using standard categories to classify inventory based on the degree to which we believe that the products may need to be discounted below cost to sell within a reasonable period 
we base inventory fair value on several subjective and unobservable assumptions including estimated future demand and market conditions  as well as other observable factors such as current sell through of our products  recent changes in demand for our product as well as shifting demand between the products we offer  global and regional economic conditions  historical experience selling through liquidation and off price channels and the amount of inventory on hand 
if the estimated inventory fair value is less than its carrying value  the carrying value is adjusted to market value and the resulting impairment charge is recorded in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of operations 
the ultimate results achieved in selling excess and discontinued products in future periods may differ significantly from management fair value estimates 
see note inventories in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding inventory and impaired product 
impairment of long lived assets we test long lived assets to be held and used for impairment when events or circumstances indicate the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be fully recoverable 
events that may indicate the impairment of a long lived asset or asset group  as defined below include  i a significant decrease in its market price  ii a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which it is being used or in its physical condition  iii a significant adverse change in legal factors or business climate that could affect its value  including an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  iv an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for its acquisition or construction  v its current period operating or cash flow losses combined with 
table of contents historical operating or cash flow losses or a forecast of its cash flows demonstrate continuing losses associated with its use  and vi a current expectation that  more likely than not  it will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
if such facts indicate a potential impairment of a long lived asset or asset group  we assess the recoverability by determining if its carrying value exceeds the sum of its projected undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition over its remaining economic life 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
fair value is determined by independent third party appraisals  the net present value of expected cash flows  or other valuation techniques as appropriate 
assets to be abandoned or from which no further benefit is expected are written down to zero at the time that the determination is made and the assets are removed entirely from service 
an asset group is the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
beginning in  we determined that the lowest level of assets and liabilities for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities is at the retail store level for assets involved in our retail business 
our estimates of future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the asset group are based on management operating budgets and forecasts 
these budgets and forecasts take into consideration inputs from our regional management related to growth rates  pricing  new markets and other factors expected to affect the business  as well as management forecasts for inventory  receivables  capital spending  and other cash needs 
these considerations and expectations are inherently uncertain  and estimates included in our operating forecasts beyond a three to six month future period are extremely subjective 
accordingly  actual cash flows may differ significantly from our estimated future cash flows 
impairment charges are driven by  among other things  changes in our strategic operational and financial decisions  global and regional economic conditions  demand for our product or shifting demand between different products we offer and other corporate initiatives which may eliminate or significantly decrease the realization of future benefits from our long lived assets and result in impairment charges in future periods 
significant impairment charges recognized during a reporting period could have an adverse affect on our reported financial results impairment of intangible assets goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable and at least annually 
intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives  such as customer relationships  core technology  capitalized software  patents and non compete agreements are amortized over their useful lives and are evaluated for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate a carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
recoverability is based on the estimated future undiscounted cash flows of an asset 
if the asset is not supported on an undiscounted cash flow basis  the amount of impairment is measured as the difference between its carrying value and its fair value 
determination of the fair value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible asset involves a number of management assumptions including the expected future operating performance of our reporting units which may change in future periods due to technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business operations  or the inability to meet business plans  among other things 
the valuation is sensitive to the actual results of any of these uncertain factors which could be negatively affected and may result in additional impairment charges should the actual results differ from management estimates 
see note intangible assets  in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our intangible assets 
share based compensation we estimate the fair value of our stock option awards using a black scholes valuation model  the inputs of which require various assumptions including the expected volatility of our stock price and the expected life of the option 
the expected volatility assumptions are derived using our historical stock price volatility and the historical volatilities of competitors whose shares are traded in the public markets 
these assumptions reflect our best estimates  but they involve 
table of contents inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of our control 
if factors change and we use a different methodology for deriving the black scholes assumptions  our stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
additionally  we make certain estimates about the number of awards which will be made under performance based incentive plans 
as a result  if other assumptions or estimates had been used  stock based compensation expense could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if we use different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
see note equity in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our stock based compensation 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of other assets and liabilities 
we provide for income taxes at the current and future enacted tax rates and laws applicable in each taxing jurisdiction 
we use a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the impact of an uncertain tax position that is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained 
no portion of an uncertain tax position will be recognized if the position has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
interest expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions 
while the validity of any tax position is a matter of tax law  the body of statutory  regulatory and interpretive guidance on the application of the law is complex and often ambiguous 
our annual tax rate is based on our income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining our annual tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions 
tax laws require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carry forwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
we evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results  the reversal of existing temporary differences  taxable income in prior carry back years if permitted and the availability of tax planning strategies 
a valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that we will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset 
undistributed earnings of a subsidiary are accounted for as a temporary difference  except that deferred tax liabilities are not recorded for undistributed earnings of a foreign subsidiary that are deemed to be indefinitely reinvested in the foreign jurisdiction 
we have operated under a specific plan for reinvestment of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries which demonstrates that such earnings will be indefinitely reinvested in the applicable tax jurisdictions 
should we change our plans  we would be required to record a significant amount of deferred tax liabilities 
we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income 
table of contents tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk includes interest rate fluctuations in connection with our revolving credit facility  see note notes payable and capital lease obligations in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates which are based on either the lender published rate  the federal funds open rate  libor or the eurodollar rate as defined in the revolving credit facility  and are subject to risk based upon prevailing market interest rates 
interest rate risk may result from many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
as of december   the amount of total borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility was immaterial 
if the prevailing market interest rates relative to these borrowings increased by  our interest expense during the year ended december  would have increased by million 
fluctuations in the prevailing market interest rates  earned on our cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash balances during the year ended december   would have an immaterial impact on the consolidated statements of operations 
foreign currency exchange risk we have significant revenues from foreign sales in recent periods 
while the majority of expenses attributable to our foreign operations are paid in the functional currency of the country in which such operations are conducted  we pay the majority of our overseas third party manufacturers in us dollars 
our ability to sell our products in foreign markets and the us dollar value of the sales made in foreign currencies can be significantly influenced by foreign currency fluctuations 
a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could result in downward price pressure for our products and increase losses from currency exchange rates 
a decrease of in value of us dollar relative to foreign currencies would have increased income before taxes during the year ended december  by approximately million 
the volatility of the applicable exchange rates is dependent on many factors that cannot be forecasted with reliable accuracy 
in the event our foreign sales and purchases increase and are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  our operating results may be affected by fluctuations in the exchange rate of currencies we receive for such sales 
see item  management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a discussion of the impact of foreign exchange rate variances experienced during the year ended december  we enter into foreign currency exchange forward contracts to reduce our exposure to changes in exchange rates 
as of december   the total notional value of outstanding foreign currency exchange forward contracts was million 
the following table summarizes the notional amounts of the outstanding derivatives at december  in thousands 
the notional amounts of the
