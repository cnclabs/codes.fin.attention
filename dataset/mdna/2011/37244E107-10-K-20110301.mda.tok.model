certain terms as used in this report  unless the context requires otherwise  we  us  our and genon refer to genon energy  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries  after giving effect to the merger 
ix 
table of contents part i item business 
on december   mirant and rri energy completed their merger 
mirant merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of rri energy  with mirant surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of rri energy 
in connection with the all stock  tax free merger  rri energy changed its name to genon energy  inc  mirant stockholders received a fixed ratio of shares of genon common stock for each share of mirant common stock  and mirant changed its name to genon energy holdings 
while rri energy was the legal acquirer  the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition  and mirant was deemed to have acquired rri energy for accounting purposes 
as a consequence of the reverse acquisition accounting treatment  the historical financial statements and results of operations presented for periods prior to the merger date are the historical statements of mirant  except for stockholders equity which has been retroactively adjusted for the equivalent number of shares of the legal acquirer 
the operations of the former rri energy businesses have been included in the financial statements from the date of the merger 
specifically  the consolidated financial statements and financial and operational results of genon include the results of mirant through december  and include the results of the combined entities from december   unless indicated otherwise 
pursuant to the plan for mirant and certain of its subsidiaries  on january   mirant emerged from bankruptcy and acquired substantially all of the assets of the old mirant corporation 
the plan provides that new mirant now named genon energy holdings has no successor liability for any unassumed obligations of the old mirant corporation 
the old corporation was then renamed and transferred to a trust  which is not affiliated with genon energy holdings

overview we provide energy  capacity  ancillary and other energy services to wholesale customers in competitive energy markets in the united states through ownership and operation of  and contracting for  power generation capacity 
we are a wholesale generator with approximately  mw of net electric generating capacity in the pjm  miso  northeast and southeast regions and california 
we also operate integrated asset management and energy marketing organizations  including proprietary trading operations 
our customers are principally isos  rtos and investor owned utilities 
our generating portfolio is diversified across fossil fuel and technology types  operating characteristics and several regional power markets and serves customers primarily located near major metropolitan load centers 
at december   our generating capacity was in pjm  in caiso  in the southeast  in miso and in nyiso and iso ne 
the net generating capacity of these facilities consisted of approximately baseload  intermediate and peaking capacity 
our coal facilities generally dispatch as baseload  although some dispatch as intermediate capacity  and our gas  oil and dual fuel plants primarily dispatch as intermediate and or peaking capacity 
strategy our goal is to create long term stockholder value across a broad range of commodity price environments 
we intend to achieve this goal by successfully integrating the companies and achieving cost savings targets 
we expect to achieve approximately million in annual cost savings through reductions in corporate overhead and support costs 
we expect cost savings to result from consolidations in several areas  including headquarters  it systems and corporate functions such as accounting  human resources and finance 
starting in january  we expect to achieve the full million of annual cost savings 
we have estimated the total merger related costs at 
table of contents approximately million 
these costs include million of advisory and legal fees and million of other merger related costs  including costs to achieve the savings 
these amounts include million incurred by rri energy prior to the merger 
during  the company incurred million 
we expect to incur approximately million  million and million during  and and beyond  respectively 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this form k and note to our consolidated financial statements 
continued operating and commercial expertise 
we have substantial experience in the management  operation and optimization of a portfolio of diverse generating facilities 
drawing on the best practices of mirant and rri energy  we intend to operate our generating facilities safely and efficiently and in an environmentally responsible manner to achieve optimal availability and performance to maximize cash flow 
transacting to reduce variability in realized gross margin 
we intend to develop and execute appropriate hedging strategies to manage risks associated with the volatility in the price at which we sell power and in the prices of fuel  emissions allowances and other inputs required to produce such power 
this includes hedging over multiple years to reduce the variability in realized gross margin from our expected generation 
in addition  we expect to continue to sell capacity either bilaterally or through periodic auction processes 
investing capital prudently 
our capital investment decisions are focused on achieving an appropriate return for our stockholders 
capital investments include participating in the development or acquisition of new facilities  the maintenance of our existing facilities for long term availability and improved commercial availability  and investments in our existing facilities to improve their competitive position 
maintaining appropriate liquidity and capital structure 
through disciplined balance sheet management and maintaining adequate liquidity  we expect to be able to operate across a broad range of commodity price environments 
business segments we have five operating segments eastern pjm  western pjm miso  california  energy marketing and other operations 
the eastern pjm segment consists of eight generating facilities located in maryland  new jersey and virginia 
the maryland and virginia generating facilities are located near washington  dc the western pjm miso segment consists of generating facilities located in illinois  ohio and pennsylvania 
the california segment consists of eight generating facilities and includes other business development efforts  including the marsh landing project 
the energy marketing segment consists of our proprietary trading  fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities 
the other operations segment consists of three generating facilities located in massachusetts  one generating facility located in new york  three generating facilities located in florida  one generating facility located in mississippi and one generating facility located in texas 
for  the other operations segment included the lovett generating facility in new york  which was shut down on april  and demolished in 
table of contents the table below summarizes selected financial information of our operations by business segment for business segments revenues gross margin operating income loss dollars in millions eastern pjm western pjm miso california energy marketing other operations eliminations total gross margin excludes depreciation and amortization 
for  we recorded billion in revenues from a single counterparty pjm which represented of our consolidated revenues 
the revenues generated from this counterparty are included in our eastern pjm  western pjm miso and energy marketing segments 
eliminations for revenues and gross margin are primarily related to intercompany sales of emissions allowances 
eliminations for operating income loss also include a million impairment loss related to goodwill recorded at our genon mid atlantic subsidiary on its standalone balance sheet 
the goodwill impairment loss and related goodwill balance are eliminated upon consolidation at genon north america and are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet of the company

in addition  we installed selective non catalytic reduction systems at the three dickerson coal fired units 
these controls are capable of reducing emissions of so  so and mercury by approximately  and  respectively  for three of our largest coal fired units in maryland 
we reviewed our chalk point  dickerson  morgantown and potomac river generating facilities for impairment as a result of our annual assessment of the goodwill recorded at our genon mid atlantic registrant on its standalone balance sheet  which is eliminated upon consolidation at genon north america 
upon completion of the assessment  we determined that none of the genon mid atlantic generating facilities was impaired at october  in december  pjm published an updated load forecast  which depicted a decrease in the expected demand from prior projections because of lower economic growth expectations 
as a result of the load forecast  our current expectation is that there will be a decrease in the clearing prices for future capacity auctions in certain years 
the decrease in projected capacity revenue caused us to update our october impairment review of genon mid atlantic s long lived assets 
upon completion of our assessment  which was based on the accounting guidance related to the impairment of long lived assets  we determined that the dickerson and potomac river generating facilities were impaired at december   as the carrying value exceeded the updated december undiscounted cash flows 
we recorded fourth quarter impairment losses of million and million on our consolidated statement of operations to reduce the carrying values of the dickerson and potomac river generating facilities  respectively  to their estimated fair values 
in addition  as a result of the full impairment of the potomac river generating facility  we recorded million in operations and maintenance expense and corresponding liabilities associated with our commitment to reduce particulate emissions at our potomac river generating facility as part of the agreement with the city of alexandria  virginia 
the planned capital investment would not be recovered in future periods based on the current projected cash flows of the potomac river generating facility 
we also have million included in funds on deposit and other noncurrent assets in the consolidated balance sheets  which represents the remaining balance placed in escrow as a result of the agreement with the city of alexandria 
see note c to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our genon mid atlantic impairment analyses 
our generating facilities located in new jersey may require further investment in environmental controls

we expect the avon lake  new castle and niles generating facilities to move from the miso region to the pjm region in june as a result of the ferc s approval of the transfer 
in and  we installed scrubbers at the keystone and cheswick generating facilities to reduce the so emissions from these facilities 
as a result  the number of so allowances we will need to purchase in the market to comply with current regulations is reduced 
these scrubbers are capable of removing up to of the so from the exhaust as well as reducing mercury emissions by up to

we shut down the potrero facility on february  the total net generating capacity for the california segment per the table excludes potrero 
see below for further discussion 
in the third quarter of  genon potrero executed a settlement agreement with the city and county of san francisco in which it agreed to shut down the potrero generating facility when it is no longer needed for reliability  as determined by the caiso 
that settlement agreement became effective in november in december  the caiso provided genon potrero with the requisite notice of termination of the rmr agreement 
on january   at the request of genon potrero  the ferc approved changes to genon potrero s rmr agreement to allow the caiso to terminate the rmr agreement effective february  on february   the potrero facility was shut down 
our existing generating facilities in california depend almost entirely on payments they receive to operate in support of system and local reliability through the sale of resource adequacy capacity to load serving entities 
the energy  capacity and ancillary services markets  as currently constituted  will not support the capital expenditures necessary to repower or reconstruct our facilities 
in order to obtain the necessary capital support for repowering or reconstructing our facilities  we would need to obtain contracts with creditworthy buyers 
absent that  our existing generating facilities in california will be commercially viable only as long as they have contracts for their capacity 
energy marketing segment our energy marketing segment includes our proprietary trading  fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities 
this activity includes the purchase and sale of electricity  fuel and emissions allowances  sometimes through financial derivatives 
using our fundamental understanding of the markets in which we operate  we support our commercial asset management activities as well as engage in proprietary trading when we identify opportunities 
we engage in fuel oil management activities to hedge economically the fair value of our physical fuel oil inventories  optimize the approximately three million barrels of storage capacity that we own or lease  as well as attempt to profit from market opportunities related to timing and or differences in the pricing of various products 
we engage in natural gas transportation and storage activities to optimize our physical natural gas and storage positions and manage the physical gas requirements for a portion of our assets 
proprietary trading  fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities together will typically comprise less than of our realized gross margin 
all of our commercial activities are governed by a comprehensive risk management policy  which includes limits on the size of volumetric positions and var for our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities and requires all incremental natural gas transportation and natural gas storage activities to be risk reducing 
for  our combined average daily var for proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities was million 
other operations segment we own or lease four generating facilities in the northeast region and five generating facilities in the southeast region with total net generating capacity of  mw

the indian river generating facility was mothballed in january  other than during the third quarter of when one unit operated under a ppa 
we own a equity interest in the sabine facility located in east texas having a net generating capacity of mw 
an unaffiliated party owns the other and an affiliated party to the other owner operates the facility 
the table includes our net share of the capacity of this facility 
we are party to a tolling agreement that expires in may and entitles us to purchase and dispatch of this facility s electric generating capacity 
the tolling agreement is treated as an operating lease for accounting purposes 
during the second quarter of  the nyiso issued its annual peak load and energy forecast in its load and capacity data report the gold book 
the gold book reports projected electricity supply and demand for the new york control area for the next ten years 
the most recent gold book projects a significant decrease in future electricity demand as a result of current economic conditions and the expected future effects of demand side management programs in new york 
the expected reduction in future demand as a result of demand side management programs is being driven primarily by an energy efficiency program being instituted within the state of new york that will seek to achieve a reduction from energy volumes by as a result of the projections in the gold book  we evaluated the bowline generating facility for impairment in the second quarter of the sum of the probability weighted undiscounted cash flows for the bowline generating facility exceeded the carrying value 
as a result  we did not record an impairment loss for the bowline generating facility during the second quarter of genon bowline has challenged its property tax assessment for the and tax years 
although the assessment for the tax year was reduced significantly from the assessment received in  the assessment continues to exceed significantly the estimated fair value of the generating facility 
in the fourth quarter of  we identified certain operational issues that reduced the available capacity of the bowline generating facility 
we are in the process of evaluating long term solutions for the generating facility  but our current expectation is that the reduction in available capacity could extend through in the fourth quarter of  we again evaluated the bowline generating facility for impairment because of the expected extended reduction in available capacity together with the pending property tax litigation and the effect of supply and demand assumptions in the nyiso s gold book 
the sum of the probability weighted undiscounted cash flows for the bowline generating facility exceeded the carrying value 
as a result  we did not record an impairment loss for the bowline generating facility during see note c to our 
table of contents consolidated financial statements for further information related to our impairment analysis of the bowline generating facility 
iso ne previously had determined that  at times  it was necessary for the canal generating facility to operate to meet local reliability criteria for sema when it is not economic for the canal generating facility to operate based upon prevailing market prices 
when the canal generating facility operates to meet local reliability criteria  we are compensated at the price we bid into the iso ne  pursuant to iso ne market rules  rather than at the market price 
during  nstar electric company completed planned upgrades to the sema transmission system 
these upgrades have reduced the need for the canal generating facility to operate and caused a reduction in energy gross margin compared to historical levels 
the final phase of these transmission upgrades was completed in the third quarter of and as a result  the capacity factor for the canal generating facility dropped as compared to with the completion of the transmission upgrades and because of the canal generating facility s high fuel costs relative to other generation in the northeast market  we expect that the future revenues of the canal generating facility will be principally capacity revenue from the iso ne forward capacity market 
the kendall generating facility  which is a cogeneration facility  has long term agreements under which it sells steam 
pursuant to a consent decree  we discontinued operation of units and at our lovett generating facility in new york in may and april  respectively 
in addition  we discontinued operation of unit at the lovett generating facility in may because it was uneconomic to operate the unit 
we completed the demolition of the lovett generating facility in asset management we provide energy  capacity  ancillary and other energy services to wholesale customers in competitive energy markets in the united states  including isos and rtos  power aggregators  retail providers  electric cooperative utilities  other power generating companies and load serving entities 
our commercial operations consist primarily of dispatching electricity  hedging the generation and sale of electricity  selling capacity  procuring and managing fuel and providing logistical support for the operation of our facilities for example  by procuring transportation for coal and natural gas 
our strategy is to enter into economic hedges forward sales of electricity and forward purchases of fuel and emissions allowances to manage the risks associated with volatility in prices for electricity  fuel and emissions allowances and to achieve more predictable financial results 
in addition  given the high correlation between natural gas prices and electricity prices in many of the markets in which we operate  we enter into forward sales of natural gas to hedge economically our exposure to changes in the price of electricity 
we procure our hedges in otc transactions or on exchanges where electricity  fuel and emissions allowances are broadly traded  or through specific transactions with buyers and sellers  using futures  forwards  swaps and options 
our hedges cover various periods  including several years 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this form k for our aggregate hedge levels based on expected generation for to in addition  see item a  risk factors risks related to economic and financial market conditions greater regulation of energy contracts for a discussion of the risks of implementation of the dodd frank act on our ability to hedge economically our generation  including potentially reducing liquidity in the energy and commodity markets and  if we are required to clear such transactions on exchanges or meet other requirements  by significantly increasing the collateral costs associated with such activities 
we sell capacity either bilaterally or through periodic auction processes in each iso and rto market in which we participate 
our capacity sales primarily occur through the pjm rpm and iso ne fcm auctions  but also in caiso  miso  nyiso and other markets where we enter into agreements with counterparties 
we expect that a substantial portion of our pjm capacity will continue to be sold in pjm up to three years in advance 
revenue from these capacity sales is determined by market rules designed to ensure regional reliability  encourage competition and reduce energy price volatility 
these capacity sales provide an important 
table of contents source of predictable revenues for us over the contracted periods 
at january   total projected contracted capacity and ppa revenues for which prices have been set for through are billion 
power we hedge economically a substantial portion of our eastern pjm coal fired baseload generation and certain of our other generation 
we generally do not hedge our intermediate and peaking units for tenors greater than months 
a significant portion of our hedges are financial swap transactions between genon mid atlantic and financial counterparties that are senior unsecured obligations of such parties and do not require either party to post cash collateral either for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices 
although standard industry otc transactions make up a substantial portion of our economic hedge portfolio  at times we sell non standard  structured products to customers 
several of our california  florida and mississippi generating facilities typically operate under contracts for their capacity or energy 
in california  genon delta has entered into agreements with pg e to provide electricity from our natural gas fired units in service at contra costa and pittsburg 
with respect to contra costa units and  genon delta is providing mw of capacity to pg e for under a multi year tolling agreement into which we entered in genon delta entered into a new agreement with pg e on september  for the mw at contra costa units and for the period from november through april at the end of the agreement  and subject to any necessary regulatory approval  genon delta has agreed to retire contra costa units and  which began operations in  in furtherance of state and federal policies to retire aging power plants that utilize once through cooling technology 
in addition  genon delta entered into an agreement with pg e on october  for  mw of capacity from pittsburg units  and for three years commencing january   with options for pg e to extend the agreement for each of and under the respective agreements  genon delta will receive monthly capacity payments with bonuses and or penalties based on heat rate and availability 
on september   genon marsh landing entered into a ten year ppa with pg e for mw of natural gas fired peaking generation to be constructed adjacent to our contra costa generating facility near antioch  california 
construction of the marsh landing generating facility is expected to be completed by mid fuel we enter into contracts of varying terms to secure appropriate quantities of fuel that meet the varying specifications of our generating facilities 
for our coal fired generating facilities  we purchase most of our coal from a small number of suppliers under contracts with terms of varying lengths  some of which extend to and one that extends to see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of this form k for discussion of our coal agreement risk 
for our oil fired units  we typically purchase fuel from a small number of suppliers either in the spot market or under contracts with terms of varying lengths 
for our natural gas fired facilities  in addition to purchasing natural gas  we arrange for and schedule its transportation through pipelines 
to perform a portion of these functions  we lease natural gas transportation and storage capacity 
we sell excess fuel supplies to third parties 
we receive coal at our generating facilities primarily by rail and truck 
in addition  we can receive coal by barge at three of our plants our morgantown generating facility completed construction of a barge unloader in that enables us to receive coal from domestic and international sources  and our cheswick and elrama generating facilities also have barge unloading facilities  which are typically used to receive domestic coal 
we have coal blending facilities at our cheswick  morgantown and titus generating facilities that allow for greater flexibility of coal supply by allowing various coal qualities to be blended while also meeting emissions targets 
we monitor coal supply and delivery logistics carefully and  despite occasional interruptions of planned deliveries  to date we have managed to avoid any significant detrimental effects on our operations 
because of the risk of disruptions in our coal supply  we strive to maintain adequate targeted levels of coal inventories at our coal fired facilities 
interruptions to planned or contracted deliveries can result from a variety of factors  
table of contents including operational issues of coal suppliers  lack of  or constraints in  coal transportation including rail system and river system disruptions and adverse weather conditions 
emissions our commercial operations manage the acquisition and use of emissions allowances for our generating facilities 
our generating facilities in maryland  massachusetts  new jersey and new york are subject to the rggi  a multi state cap and trade program to reduce co emissions from units of mw or greater 
the rggi became effective on january  to comply  we are required to purchase allowances  either through periodic auctions or open market transactions  to offset our co emissions 
in and  we recognized approximately million and million  respectively  in cost of fuel  electricity and other products as a result of our compliance with the rggi 
in may  the montgomery county council imposed a levy on major emitters of co in montgomery county  maryland which we estimate will impose on the dickerson generating facility of genon mid atlantic an additional million to million per year in levies owed to montgomery county 
during  we recognized million in levies in operations and maintenance expense 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the action filed against montgomery county in the united states district court for the district of maryland by genon mid atlantic 
coal combustion byproducts existing state and federal rules require the proper management and disposal of wastes and other materials 
we produce byproducts from our coal fired generating units  including ash and gypsum 
we actively manage the current and planned disposition of each of these byproducts 
all of our ash disposal facilities are dry landfills although we do use ponds to dewater ash at some facilities 
our disposal plan for ash includes land filling at our existing ash management facilities  purchasing and permitting additional disposal sites  using third parties to handle and dispose of the ash  and constructing an ash beneficiation facility at our morgantown site to make the ash more suitable for sale to third parties for the production of concrete as well as other beneficial uses 
we commenced construction of the ash beneficiation facility in february and expect to complete it in our disposal plan for gypsum includes disposing of it in approved landfills and selling it to third parties for use in the production of drywall 
currently  we expect to spend approximately million over the next five years for ash landfill expansions  closures and for building an ash beneficiation facility 
there is increased focus on the regulation of coal combustion products and  if the manner in which they are regulated changes  we may be required to change our management practices for these byproducts and or incur additional costs 
competitive environment the power generating industry is capital intensive and highly competitive 
our competitors include regulated utilities  merchant energy companies  financial institutions and other companies 
for a discussion of competitive factors see item a  risk factors 
coal fired  natural gas fired  nuclear and hydroelectric generation currently account for approximately   and  respectively  of the electricity produced in the united states 
other energy sources account for the remaining of electricity produced 
wholesale power generation is highly fragmented compared to other commodity industries 
there is wide variation in terms of the capabilities  resources  nature and identity of the companies with which we compete 
our competitive advantages include the following reliability of our future cash flows 
our large coal generating fleet is exposed to the relationship between the cost of production and the price of the power produced 
this relationship  commonly referred to as the dark spread  fluctuates with the cost of coal and the price of power 
we hedge economically a substantial portion of our eastern pjm coal fired baseload generation and certain of our other generation 
we hedge our output at varying levels several years in advance because the price of electricity is volatile 
in addition  we enter into contracts to hedge economically our future needs of coal  which is our primary fuel 

table of contents locational advantages 
many of our generating facilities are located in or near metropolitan areas  including boston  new york city  pittsburgh  san francisco  southern california los angeles and washington  dc the supply demand balance in some of these markets is forecasted to become constrained  though at a slower rate than forecasted before the economic downturn  and increasingly dependent on power imported from other regions to sustain reliability 
although transmission projects are planned in these markets to bring capacity from neighboring regions  the timing of these projects is subject to delays and uncertainty 
room to expand at our existing sites 
we have sufficient room and infrastructure at many of our existing sites to increase significantly our generating capacity when market rules and conditions warrant 
in addition to reduced costs for developing new generation at existing sites because of our ownership of the land and our ownership of and or access to infrastructure  regulators frequently prefer that new generation be added at existing sites brownfield development rather than at new sites greenfield development 
we continue to consider these and other investment opportunities 
given the substantial time required to permit and construct new power plants  the process to add generating capacity must begin years in advance of anticipated growth in demand 
a number of isos and rtos  including those in markets in which we operate  have implemented capacity markets as a way to encourage construction of additional generation when market conditions warrant 
over the last several years  very little new generation has been constructed as a result of the economic downturn in recent years and programs to reduce the demand for electricity which have resulted in a decrease in the rate at which the long term demand for electricity is forecasted to grow 
also  the costs to construct new generating facilities have been rising  and there is substantial environmental opposition to building either coal fired or nuclear plants 
in some markets  state regulators have proposed initiatives to provide long term contracts for new generating capacity 
in december  the maryland public service commission sought comments on a possible request for proposals for new generating facilities 
the draft request for proposals would require any such new generation to bid into the capacity markets in a manner that would ensure clearing in the market 
the draft request provides for project submittals on july  we filed comments on the draft request for proposals on january   noting there is no need for additional capacity at this time 
if the request for proposals is issued as currently drafted  it could have a negative effect on capacity prices in pjm in future years 
on january   new jersey enacted legislation which requires the board of public utilities to implement a long term capacity agreement pilot program providing for new generating capacity in the state 
the new generating capacity would be required to participate and be accepted as a capacity resource in the pjm capacity market 
if the new jersey agreement for new capacity is implemented as required by the statute  it could have a negative effect on capacity prices in pjm in future years 
on february   a group of which we are a member initiated a proceeding at the ferc seeking changes in the pjm tariff to prevent interference with the capacity markets from efforts such as the new jersey legislation and the maryland request for proposals 
on february   we joined a group of companies that filed suit in the us district court for new jersey asking the court to declare the new jersey legislation unconstitutional 
in addition  as a result of initiatives at both the federal and state level  new construction of renewable resources  including solar and wind  has occurred or is planned 
there are proposed upgrades to the transmission systems in some of the markets in which we operate that could mitigate the need for existing marginal generating capacity and for additional generating capacity 
to the extent that these upgrades are completed  prices for electricity and capacity could be lower in some of our markets than they might otherwise be 
the prices for power and natural gas remain low compared to several years ago 
the energy gross margin from our generating facilities is negatively affected by these price levels 
for that portion of the volumes of generation that we have hedged  we are generally economically neutral to subsequent changes in commodity prices because our realized gross margin will reflect the contractual prices of our power and fuel contracts 
we continue to add economic hedges  including to maintain projected levels of cash flows from operations for 
table of contents future periods to help support continued compliance with the covenants in our debt and lease agreements 
we have implemented seasonal operating models at some of our facilities to address the effect of depressed power and commodity prices on the margins earned at these facilities 
concern over climate change and air emissions have led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts at the state and federal level 
the costs of compliance with such efforts could affect our ability to compete in the markets in which we operate  especially with our coal fired generating facilities 
see environmental regulation later in the section for further discussion 
seasonality for information on the effect of seasonality on our business  see risk factors in item a of this form k and note to our consolidated financial statements 
regulatory environment the electricity industry is regulated extensively at the federal  state and local levels 
at the federal level  the ferc has exclusive jurisdiction under the federal power act over sales of electricity at wholesale and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce 
each of our subsidiaries that owns or leases a generating facility selling at wholesale or that markets electricity at wholesale is a public utility subject to the ferc s jurisdiction under the federal power act 
these subsidiaries must comply with certain ferc reporting requirements and ferc approved market rules and they are subject to ferc oversight of mergers and acquisitions  the disposition of facilities under the ferc s jurisdiction and the issuance of securities 
the ferc has authorized our subsidiaries that are public utilities under the federal power act to sell wholesale energy  capacity and certain ancillary services at market based rates 
the majority of the output of the generating facilities owned by our subsidiaries is sold pursuant to this market based rate authorization  although our potrero station sold its output under a cost based rmr agreement through february for which separate rate authorization was granted by the ferc 
the ferc could revoke or limit our market based rate authority if it determined that we possess insufficiently mitigated market power in a regional electricity market 
under the natural gas act  our subsidiaries that sell natural gas for resale are deemed by the ferc to have blanket certificate authority to undertake these sales at market based rates 
the ferc requires that our public utility subsidiaries with market based rate authority and our subsidiaries with blanket certificate authority adhere to general rules against market manipulation as well as certain market behavior rules and codes of conduct 
if any of our subsidiaries were found to have engaged in market manipulation  the ferc has the authority to impose a civil penalty of up to million per day per violation 
in addition to the civil penalties  if any of our subsidiaries were to engage in market manipulation or violate the market behavior rules or codes of conduct  the ferc could require a disgorgement of profits or revoke the subsidiary s market based rate authority or blanket certificate authority 
if the ferc were to revoke market based rate authority  our affected public utility subsidiary would have to file a cost based rate schedule for all or some of its sales of electricity at wholesale 
in  the ferc certified the nerc as the national energy reliability organization 
the nerc is now responsible for the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the electric power system 
each of our subsidiaries selling electricity at wholesale is responsible for complying with the reliability standards in the region in which it operates 
the nerc has the ability to assess financial penalties for non compliance with the reliability standards  which penalties can  depending on the nature of the non compliance  be significant 
in addition to complying with the nerc standards  each of our entities selling electricity at wholesale must comply with the reliability standards of the regional reliability council for the nerc region in which its sales occur 

table of contents the vast majority of our facilities operate in markets administered by isos and rtos 
in areas where isos or rtos control the regional transmission systems  market participants have access to broader geographic markets than in regions without isos and rtos 
isos and rtos operate day ahead and real time energy and ancillary services markets  typically governed by ferc approved tariffs and market rules 
some isos and rtos also operate capacity markets 
changes to the applicable tariffs and market rules may be requested by the iso or rto  or by other interested persons  including market participants and state regulatory agencies  and such proposed changes  if approved by the ferc  could have a significant effect on our operations and financial results 
although participation in isos and rtos by public utilities that own transmission has been  and is expected to continue to be  voluntary  the majority of such public utilities in california  illinois  maryland  massachusetts  new jersey  new york  ohio  pennsylvania and virginia have joined the applicable iso and rto 
our subsidiaries owning generating facilities have made such filings  and received such orders  as are necessary to obtain exempt wholesale generator status under the puhca and the ferc s regulations thereunder 
provided all of our subsidiaries owning or leasing generating facilities continue to be exempt wholesale generators  or are qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of  we and our intermediate holding companies owning direct or indirect interests in those subsidiaries will remain exempt from the accounting  record retention or reporting requirements that puhca imposes on holding companies 
state and local regulatory authorities historically have overseen the distribution and sale of electricity at retail to the ultimate end user  as well as the siting  permitting and construction of generating and transmission facilities 
our existing generating facilities are subject to a variety of state and local regulations  including regulations regarding the environment  health and safety and maintenance and expansion of the facilities 
we hedge economically a substantial portion of our eastern pjm coal fired baseload generation and certain of our other generation 
a significant portion of such hedges are financial swap transactions between genon mid atlantic and financial counterparties that are senior unsecured obligations of such parties and do not require either party to post cash collateral either for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices 
the dodd frank act  which was enacted in july in response to the global financial crisis  increases the regulation of transactions involving otc derivative financial instruments 
the statute provides that standardized swap transactions between dealers and large market participants will have to be cleared and traded on an exchange or electronic platform 
although the provisions and legislative history of the dodd frank act provide strong evidence that market participants  such as genon  which utilize otc derivative financial instruments to hedge economically commercial risks are not to be subject to these clearing and exchange trading requirements  it is uncertain what the final implementing regulations to be issued by the cftc and sec will provide 
the effect of the dodd frank act on our business depends in large measure on pending cftc and sec rulemaking proceedings and  in particular  the final definitions for the key terms swap dealer and major swap participant in the dodd frank act 
the cftc and sec issued a proposed rulemaking to set final definitions for the terms swap dealer and major swap participant  among others 
entities defined as swap dealers and major swap participants will face costly requirements for clearing and posting margin  as well as additional requirements for reporting and business conduct 
as proposed  the swap dealer definition in particular is ambiguous  subjective and could be broad enough to encompass some energy companies 
such regulations could materially affect our ability to hedge economically our generation by reducing liquidity in the energy and commodity markets and  if we were required to clear such transactions on exchanges or meet other requirements  by significantly increasing the collateral costs associated with such activities 
see item a  risk factors risks related to economic and financial market conditions greater regulation of energy contracts for additional information 
under the dodd frank act  the cftc now has the authority to set position limits not only on contracts listed by designated contract markets but also for swap contracts that perform or affect a significant price discovery function 
as a result of the significant amendments to the commodity exchange act by the dodd frank act  the cftc withdrew  in august  the january notice of proposed rulemaking in which it proposed to adopt all months combined  single non spot month and spot month position limits for exchange listed natural gas  crude oil  heating oil and gasoline futures and options contracts 
the cftc plans to issue a 
table of contents notice of rulemaking proposing position limits for regulated exempt commodity contracts  including energy commodity contracts  in early in addition to the upcoming position limit rulemakings under the dodd frank act  the cftc has designated and put into effect position limits for certain electricity and natural gas contracts designated as significant price discovery contracts  including contracts based on caiso and pjm west hub locational marginal pricing that we trade on the intercontinental exchange  inc designations put into effect to date have not had a material effect on our business 
we continue to monitor the rulemaking proceeding on the remaining contracts 
pjm region 
our eastern and western pjm generating facilities sell electricity into the markets operated by pjm 
we have access to the pjm transmission system pursuant to pjm s open access transmission tariff 
pjm operates the pjm interchange energy market  which is the region s spot market for wholesale electricity  provides ancillary services for its transmission customers  performs transmission planning for the region and economically dispatches generating facilities 
pjm administers day ahead and real time single clearing price markets and calculates electricity prices based on a locational marginal pricing model 
a locational marginal pricing model determines a price for energy at each node in a particular zone taking into account the limitations and losses on transmission of electricity into the zone  resulting in a higher zonal price when less expensive energy cannot be imported from another zone 
generation owners in pjm are subject to mitigation  which limits the prices that they may receive under certain specified conditions 
load serving entities within pjm are required to have adequate sources of generating capacity 
our generating facilities located in the eastern and western pjm region that sell electricity into the pjm market participate in the rpm forward capacity market 
the pjm rpm capacity auctions are designed to provide forward prices for capacity that ensure that adequate resources are in place to meet the region s demand requirements 
pjm has conducted seven rpm capacity auctions and we began receiving payments in june as a result of the first auction 
certain market participants have challenged the results of the rpm auctions that set capacity payments under the rpm provisions of pjm s tariff for the twelve month periods beginning june   june  and june  the ferc rejected those challenges and its orders were affirmed by the dc circuit 
see complaint challenging capacity rates under the rpm provisions of pjm s tariff in note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the challenges 
since  annual auctions have been conducted to procure capacity three years prior to each delivery period 
the first annual auction took place in may  for the provision of capacity from june  to may  pjm continues to revise elements of the rpm provisions of its tariff  both pursuant to those provisions and on its own volition or at the request of its stakeholders 
these revisions must be filed with and approved by the ferc  and we  either individually or as part of a group  are actively involved at the ferc to protect our interests 
see competitive environment for our involvement at the ferc 
miso 
our miso generating facilities sell electricity into the markets operated by miso 
miso manages the transmission system and provides open access to its transmission system and markets to all market participants on an equal basis 
miso operates physical and financial energy markets using a locational marginal pricing model  which calculates a price for every generator and load point within miso similar to the model utilized by pjm 
miso operates day ahead and real time markets into which generators can offer to provide energy 
miso does not administer a centralized capacity market 
miso implemented the ancillary services market regulation and operating reserves on january  and implemented an enforceable planning reserve margin for each planning year effective june  a feature of the ancillary services market is the addition of scarcity pricing that  during supply shortages  can raise the combined price of energy and ancillary services significantly higher than the previous cap of  mwh 
california 
our california generating facilities are located inside the caiso s control area 
on april   the caiso implemented its market redesign and technology update mrtu 
mrtu s key components include locational marginal pricing of energy similar to the rto iso markets in the east  a day ahead market in addition to the existing real time market  a more effective congestion management system and an increase in the existing bid caps 
the caiso also schedules transmission transactions and arranges for necessary ancillary services 
most sales in california are pursuant to bilateral contracts  but a significant 
table of contents percentage of electrical energy is sold in the day ahead and real time market 
the caiso does not operate a wholesale capacity market 
other operations 
our bowline generating facility participates in a market administered by the nyiso 
the nyiso provides statewide transmission service under a single tariff and interfaces with neighboring market control areas 
to account for transmission congestion and losses  the nyiso calculates energy prices using a locational marginal pricing model 
the nyiso also administers a spot market for energy  as well as markets for installed capacity and services that are ancillary to transmission service 
the nyiso s locational capacity market utilizes a demand curve mechanism to determine monthly capacity prices to be paid to suppliers for three capacity zones new york city  long island and rest of state 
our facility is located in the rest of state capacity zone 
our canal  kendall and martha s vineyard generating facilities participate in a market administered by iso ne 
genon energy management is a member of the new england power pool  which is a voluntary association of electric utilities and other market participants in connecticut  maine  massachusetts  new hampshire  rhode island and vermont  and which functions as an advisory organization to iso ne 
as the rto for the new england region  iso ne is responsible for the operation of transmission systems and for the administration and settlement of the wholesale electric energy  capacity and ancillary services markets 
iso ne utilizes a locational marginal pricing model similar to the model used in pjm  miso and nyiso 
on march   a settlement proposal was filed with the ferc among iso ne and multiple market participants for the fcm under which annual capacity auctions would be conducted for supply three years in advance of provision 
the settlement provided for a four year transition period during which capacity suppliers receive a set price for their capacity commencing on december   with price escalators through may  beginning december   our generating facilities began receiving capacity revenues under the fcm transition period 
on june   our generating facilities began receiving capacity revenues based upon the auction results 
our choctaw  sabine  indian river and osceola generating facilities located in the southeast region do not operate in a market that is operated by an rto or iso 
opportunities to negotiate bilateral contracts and long term transactions with investor owned utilities  municipalities and cooperatives exist within this region 
in addition to entering into bilateral transactions  there is a limited opportunity to sell into the short term market 
access to the transmission system in this region to which the generating facility is interconnected is governed by the ferc approved terms and conditions of the applicable transmission provider s open access transmission tariff 
in the entergy sub region  which the choctaw facility can access  southwest power pool has been designated as the independent coordinator of transmission 
in this capacity  the independent coordinator of transmission provides oversight of the entergy transmission system 
environmental regulation our business is subject to extensive environmental regulation by federal  state and local authorities 
we must comply with applicable laws and regulations  and obtain and comply with the terms of government issued permits 
these requirements relate to a broad range of our activities  including the discharge of materials into the air  water and soil  the proper handling of solid  hazardous and toxic materials and waste  noise and safety  and health standards applicable to the workplace 
some of these requirements are under revision or in dispute  and some new requirements are pending or under consideration 
our costs of complying with environmental laws and permits are substantial  including significant environmental capital expenditures 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital expenditures and capital resources for additional information 
air emissions regulations the clean air act and similar state laws impose significant environmental requirements on our generating facilities 
the clean air act mandates a broad range of requirements concerning air quality  air emissions  operating practices and pollution control equipment 
under the clean air act  the epa sets naaqs for pollutants thought to be harmful to public health and the environment  including so  so ozone  
table of contents and fine particulate matter pm 
most of our facilities are located in or near areas that are classified by the epa as not achieving certain naaqs non attainment areas 
the relevant naaqs have become more stringent and we expect that trend to continue 
as a result of such classification and the manner in which regulators seek to achieve the naaqs  our operations generally are subject to more stringent air pollution requirements than those applicable to facilities located elsewhere 
the states are generally free to impose requirements that are more stringent than those imposed by the federal government 
we expect increased regulation at both the federal and state levels of our air emissions 
we maintain a comprehensive compliance strategy to address these continuing and new requirements 
complying with increasingly stringent naaqs may require us to install and operate additional emissions control equipment at some of our facilities if we decide to continue to operate such facilities 
such costs could be material 
significant air regulatory programs to which we are subject are described below 
clean air interstate rule 
in  the epa promulgated the cair  which established in the eastern united states so and so cap and trade programs applicable directly to states and indirectly to generating facilities 
the nox cap and trade program has two components  an annual program and an ozone season program 
the cair so cap and trade program builds off the existing acid rain cap and trade program but requires generating facilities to surrender twice as many allowances to cover emissions from through and approximately three times as many allowances starting in florida  illinois  maryland  mississippi  new jersey  new york  ohio  pennsylvania  texas and virginia are subject to the cair s so trading program and both its nox trading programs 
massachusetts is subject only to the cair s ozone season nox trading program 
these cap and trade programs were to be implemented in two phases  with the first phase going into effect in for nox and for nox and more stringent caps going into effect in various parties challenged the epa s adoption of the cair  and on july   the dc circuit in state of north carolina v 
environmental protection agency issued an opinion that would have vacated the cair 
various parties filed requests for rehearing with the dc circuit and on december   the dc circuit issued a second opinion in which it granted rehearing only to the extent that it remanded the case to the epa without vacating the cair 
accordingly  the cair will remain effective until it is replaced by a rule consistent with the dc circuit s opinions 
the states in which we operate that are subject to cair ie  florida  illinois  maryland  massachusetts  mississippi  new jersey  new york  ohio  pennsylvania  texas and virginia have promulgated regulations implementing the federal cair 
the epa has stated that it expects to finalize the regulations to replace the cair in  and on august   the epa proposed a rule the transport rule to replace the cair 
the epa has sought comment on the proposed transport rule as well as several alternatives 
if finalized  the cair replacement proposal and each of the alternatives would impose more stringent emission reductions than were required under the cair 
the epa s proposed replacement rule would establish an emissions budget for each of thirty one eastern and midwestern states and the district of columbia  and would allow only limited interstate trading 
for so  generating facilities in a region comprised of georgia  illinois  indiana  iowa  kentucky  michigan  missouri  new york  north carolina  ohio  pennsylvania  tennessee  virginia  west virginia and wisconsin would be subject to a more stringent cap on so emissions than the other states subject to the rule  and would not be allowed to use emissions allowances from sources in a separate region comprised of alabama  connecticut  delaware  the district of columbia  florida  kansas  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  minnesota  nebraska  new jersey and south carolina 
for both so and so  interstate trading of emissions allowances would be allowed only to the extent that the total number of emissions allowances used within a particular state did not exceed the state s budgeted allowances plus a variability limit intended to account for the variability of emissions because of changes in demand for electricity  timing of maintenance activities and unit outages 
if total emissions allowances used within a state in a year exceed the annual budget plus the variability limit  then owners of generating facilities in that state that are deemed responsible for the state s exceedance would be required to surrender additional allowances 
the two alternatives on which the epa sought comment would further restrict trading 
under the first alternative  only intrastate trading of allowances would be allowed 
the second alternative would establish an emissions limit for each generating facility  with some averaging allowed 
in january  the epa also sought comment on two additional methods of allocating allowances 
finally  the epa has also stated that it may issue a subsequent  more stringent rule if it concludes that recent or planned revisions to the particulate matter and ozone naaqs make 
table of contents necessary more stringent limits on so and so emissions from electric generating facilities 
we continue to monitor developments related to the epa s proposed options to replace the existing cair 
the effect on our business of these pending regulations and whether we elect to install additional controls is uncertain and depends on the content and timing of the regulations  the expected effect of the regulations on wholesale power prices and allowance prices  as well as the cost of controls  profitability of our generating facilities  market conditions at the time and the likelihood of co regulation 
we may choose to retire certain of our units rather than install additional controls 
the costs associated with more stringent environmental air quality requirements may result in coal fired generating facilities  including some of ours  being retired 
although conditions may change  under current and forecasted market conditions  installations of additional scrubbers would not be economic at most of our unscrubbed coal fired facilities 
any such retirements could contribute to improving supply and demand fundamentals for the remaining fleet 
any resulting increased demand for gas could increase the spread between gas and coal prices  which would also benefit the remaining coal fired generating facilities 
maryland healthy air act 
the maryland healthy air act was enacted in april and requires reductions in so  so and mercury emissions from large coal fired power facilities 
the state law also required maryland to join the rggi  which is discussed below 
the maryland healthy air act and the regulations adopted by mde to implement that act impose limits for a emissions of nox in with further reductions in including sublimits during the ozone season and b emissions of so in with further reductions in the maryland healthy air act also imposes restrictions on emissions of mercury beginning in with further reductions in the maryland healthy air act imposes fixed limits and owners of power facilities may not exceed these fixed limits by purchasing emissions allowances to comply 
we installed scrubbers at our chalk point  dickerson and morgantown coal fired units 
in addition  we installed scr systems at the morgantown coal fired units and one of the chalk point coal fired units and a selective auto catalytic reduction system at the other chalk point coal fired unit 
we also installed selective non catalytic reduction systems at the three dickerson coal fired units 
these controls are capable of reducing emissions of so  so and mercury by approximately  and  respectively  for three of our largest coal fired units 
the control equipment we have installed allows our maryland generating facilities to comply with a the first phase of the cair without having to purchase emissions allowances and b all of the requirements of the maryland healthy air act 
in  we had planned outages to complete the installation of the scrubbers 
during those outages  we also performed significant maintenance activities 
we expect to invest billion in capital expenditures to comply with the requirements for so  so and mercury emissions under the maryland healthy air act 
at december   we had invested billion of the billion 
in july  our subsidiaries genon mid atlantic and genon chalk point entered into an agreement with stone webster  inc for epc services relating to the installation of the scrubbers described above 
the cost under the agreement was approximately billion and is a part of the billion described above 
see note to our consolidated financial statements under scrubber contract litigation for further discussion 
new jersey 
in april  the new jersey department of environmental protection finalized a regulation requiring a two phase reduction in nox emissions from combustion turbines in new jersey 
phase i requires reductions during high electricity demand days and runs from may through under our compliance plan  we operate enhanced nox controls at our shawville  pennsylvania generating facility upwind from new jersey on high energy demand days 
phase ii requires the installation of emission controls on all but one of our new jersey generating facilities gilbert  glen gardner  sayreville and werner by may  the new jersey department of environmental protection is evaluating proposed changes to its high electricity demand days regulations and may defer for two years  in part or in whole  requirements for reduction in nox emissions from combustion turbines 
if we elect to install these controls  we could incur capital expenditures of up to approximately million primarily during to assuming the two year deferral described above 
our initial phase ii control plan was filed with the state of new jersey and our decision on investments should occur by 
table of contents haps regulations 
in  the epa issued the camr  which would have limited total annual mercury emissions from coal fired power plants across the united states through a two phased cap and trade program 
in february  the dc circuit vacated the camr and the epa s decision not to regulate coal and oil fired electric utility steam generating units under section of the clean air act  which requires the epa to develop mact standards for controlling emissions of all haps  including mercury 
the epa and a group representing electricity generators sought review of the dc circuit s decision by the united states supreme court 
in february  the epa filed to withdraw its petition for review  stating that it intends to promulgate alternative regulations for electricity generators under section of the clean air act  and the united states supreme court subsequently denied the petition for review 
as a result of the dc circuit decision  coal fired and oil fired generating facilities are now subject to regulation under the section of the clean air act that generally requires the epa to develop mact standards to control haps  including mercury  from each covered facility 
although the epa has announced that it will develop mact standards for mercury and other haps  it has not yet promulgated such standards 
the mact standards may require us to install and operate additional emissions control equipment at some of our facilities  the cost of which may be material 
the epa has collected emissions data  which will be used to develop such standards 
our maryland coal fired units already are subject to mercury limits under the maryland healthy air act  as described above 
many of our coal fired units will emit less mercury as a result of the so and so controls that have been installed 
in the interim  a number of states  including pennsylvania  pursued mercury regulations 
in december  the pennsylvania supreme court upheld a lower court s determination that the proposed pennsylvania mercury rule was unlawful and unenforceable 
new source review enforcement initiative 
the epa and various states are investigating compliance of coal fired electric generating facilities with the pre construction permitting requirements of the clean air act known as new source review 
in the past decade  the epa has made information requests for our avon lake  chalk point  cheswick  conemaugh  dickerson  elrama  keystone  morgantown  new castle  niles  portland  potomac river  shawville and titus generating facilities 
we are corresponding or have corresponded with the epa regarding all of these requests 
if a violation is determined to have occurred at any of the facilities  our subsidiary owning or leasing the facilities may be responsible for the cost of purchasing and installing emissions control equipment  the cost of which may be material 
several of our generating facilities already have installed a variety of emissions control equipment 
if such a violation is determined to have occurred after our subsidiaries acquired or leased the facilities or  if occurring prior to the acquisition or lease  is determined to constitute a continuing violation  our subsidiary owning or leasing the facility at issue could also be subject to fines and penalties by the state or federal government for the period after its acquisition or lease of the facility  the cost of which may be material  although applicable bankruptcy law may bar such liability for the chalk point  dickerson  morgantown and potomac river generating facilities for periods prior to january   when the plan became effective 
regulation of greenhouse gases  including the rggi 
concern over climate change has led to significant legislative and regulatory efforts at the state and federal level to limit greenhouse gas emissions  especially co one such effort is the rggi  a multi state initiative in the eastern pjm and northeast outlining a cap and trade program to reduce co emissions from electric generating units with capacity of mw or greater 
the rggi program calls for signatory states  which include maryland  massachusetts  new jersey and new york  to stabilize co emissions to an established baseline from through  followed by a reduction each year from through each of these four states has promulgated regulations implementing the rggi 
complying with the rggi could have a material adverse effect upon our operations and our operating costs  depending upon the availability and cost of emissions allowances and the extent to which such costs may be offset by higher market prices to recover increases in operating costs caused by the rggi 
as contemplated in a memorandum of understanding among the participating states  regional greenhouse gas initiative  inc is comprehensively reviewing the program  which may cause the participating states to change the manner in which the program is administered and may increase our cost to comply 
during  we produced approximately million tons of co at our maryland  massachusetts  new jersey and new york generating facilities for a total cost of million under the rggi including all former mirant generating facilities for and all former rri energy generating facilities for december 
in 
table of contents  we expect to produce approximately million tons of co at our maryland  massachusetts  new jersey and new york generating facilities 
the rggi regulations required those facilities to obtain allowances to emit co beginning in annual allowances generally were not granted to existing sources of such emissions 
instead  allowances have been made available for such facilities by purchase through periodic auctions conducted quarterly or through subsequent purchase from a party that holds allowances sold through a quarterly auction 
the tenth auction of allowances by the rggi states was held on december  the clearing price for the approximately million allowances sold in the auction allocated for use beginning in the first control period was per ton 
the clearing price for the approximately million allowances sold in the auction allocated for use beginning in the second control period was per ton 
the allowances sold in this auction may be used for compliance in any of the rggi states 
further auctions will occur quarterly  with the next auction scheduled for march in california  emissions of greenhouse gases are governed by california s global warming solutions act ab  which requires that statewide greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to levels by in december  the carb approved a scoping plan for implementing ab the scoping plan requires that the carb adopt a cap and trade regulation by january and that the cap and trade program begin in the carb s schedule for developing regulations to implement ab is being coordinated with the schedule of the wci for development of a regional cap and trade program for greenhouse gas emissions 
through the wci  california is working with other western states and canadian provinces to coordinate and implement a regional cap and trade program 
in october  the carb released its proposed cap and trade regulation for public comment  which the carb approved in december our california generating facilities will be required to comply beginning in the recently adopted cap and trade regulation and any other plans  rules and programs approved to implement ab  could adversely affect the costs of operating the facilities 
in july  the pennsylvania climate change act was adopted 
this legislation requires development of reports of the effects of climate change in pennsylvania and potential economic opportunities resulting from mitigation strategies 
it requires development of an annual state level greenhouse gas emissions inventory and baseline  a voluntary registry  and establishment of cost effective state level strategies for reducing or offsetting greenhouse gases 
the climate change advisory committee established by the act published a climate change action plan in december the plan includes numerous recommendations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the state by percent below year levels 
recommendations affecting fossil power generation are carbon capture and sequestration at selected coal fired units and minimum efficiency improvements 
the plans also recommend greenhouse gas performance standards for new power plants 
in august  massachusetts adopted the climate protection act  which establishes a program to reduce greenhouse gas emissions significantly over the next years 
under the climate protection act  the madep has established a reporting and verification system for statewide greenhouse gas emissions  including emissions from generating facilities producing all electricity consumed in massachusetts  and determined the state s greenhouse gas emissions level in under the climate change act  the maeea is to establish statewide greenhouse gas emissions limits effective beginning in that will reduce such emissions from the levels by a range of to beginning in  with the reduction increasing to below levels by in setting these limits  the maeea is to consider the potential costs and benefits of various reduction measures  including emissions limits for electric generating facilities  and may consider the use of market based compliance mechanisms 
a violation of the emissions limits established under the climate protection act may result in a civil penalty of up to  per day 
implementation of the climate protection act could have a material adverse effect on how we operate our massachusetts generating facilities and the costs of operating those facilities 
on december   the maeea established a limit for that is less than the level 
in april  the maryland general assembly passed the maryland act  which became effective in october the maryland act requires a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in maryland by from levels by however  this provision of the maryland act is only in effect through unless a 
table of contents subsequent statutory enactment extends its effective period 
the maryland act requires the mde to develop a proposed implementation plan to achieve these reductions by the end of and to adopt a final plan by the end of in light of the united states supreme court ruling in massachusetts v 
epa that greenhouse gases fit within the clean air act s definition of air pollutant  the epa has proposed and promulgated regulations regarding the emission of greenhouse gases 
in september  the epa promulgated a rule that requires owners of facilities in many sectors of the economy  including power generation  to report annually to the epa the quantity and source of greenhouse gas emissions released from those facilities 
in addition to this reporting requirement  the epa has promulgated several rules that address greenhouse gas emissions 
in december  under a portion of the clean air act that regulates vehicles  the epa determined that elevated concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere endanger the public s health and welfare through their contribution to climate change endangerment finding 
in april  the epa finalized a rule to regulate greenhouse gases from vehicles beginning in model year in april  the epa also issued its reconsideration of interpretation of regulations that determine pollutants covered by clean air act permitting programs  which addresses the scope of pollutants subject to certain permitting requirements under the clean air act as well as when such requirements become effective 
the epa has stated that  because of the vehicle rule  emissions of greenhouse gases from new stationary sources such as power plants and from major modifications to such sources are subject to certain clean air act permitting requirements as of january these permitting requirements will require such sources to use best available control technology to limit their greenhouse gases 
we expect various parties to seek judicial review of these regulations and that the legal challenges to these regulations will not be resolved for several years 
the additional substantive requirements under the clean air act that may apply or may come to apply to stationary sources such as power plants are not clear at this time 
in december  the epa announced that it was starting the process of developing regulations under the new source performance standard section of the clean air act that would affect new and existing fossil fueled generating facilities 
the epa expects to propose regulations by july and to finalize such regulations by may in addition to the state and regional regulatory matters described above  various bills have been proposed in congress to govern co emissions from generating facilities 
current proposals include a cap and trade system that would require us to purchase allowances for some or all of the co emitted by our generating facilities 
if co regulation becomes more stringent  we expect the demand for gas and or renewable sources of electricity will increase over time 
although we expect that market prices for electricity would increase following such regulation and would allow us to recover a portion of the cost of these allowances  we cannot predict with any certainty the actual increases in costs such regulation could impose upon us or our ability to recover such cost increases through higher market rates for electricity  and such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated statements of operations  financial position and cash flows 
it is possible that congress will take action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions within the next several years 
the form and timing of any final legislation will be influenced by political and economic factors and is uncertain at this time 
implementation of a co cap and trade program in addition to other emission control requirements could increase the likelihood of coal fired generating facility retirements 
during  we produced approximately million tons of co at our generating facilities including all former mirant generating facilities for and all former rri energy generating facilities for december to december  
our former rri energy generating facilities produced approximately million tons of co for january through december  we expect to produce approximately million total tons of co at our generating facilities in water regulations we are required under the clean water act to comply with intake and discharge requirements  requirements for technological controls and operating practices 
to discharge water  we generally need permits required by the clean water act 
such permits typically are subject to review every five years 
as with air quality regulations  federal and state water regulations are expected to impose additional and more stringent 
table of contents requirements or limitations in the future 
this is particularly the case for regulatory requirements governing cooling water intake structures  which are subject to regulation under section b of the clean water act the b regulations 
a decision by the united states court of appeals for the second circuit the second circuit in riverkeeper inc et al 
v 
epa  in which the court remanded to the epa for reconsideration numerous provisions of the epa s section b regulations for existing power plants  has created substantial uncertainty about exactly what technologies or other measures will be needed to satisfy section b requirements in the future and when any new requirements will be imposed 
following that ruling by the second circuit  the epa in suspended its b regulations for existing power plants 
various parties sought review of the second circuit s decision by the united states supreme court  and it granted those requests with respect to whether the epa could permissibly weigh costs versus benefits in determining what requirements to impose 
on april   the supreme court reversed the second circuit  ruling that the epa had permissibly relied on cost benefit analysis in setting standards for cooling water intake structures for existing power plants and authorizing site specific variances 
the supreme court s ruling did not alter other aspects of the second circuit s decision 
significant uncertainty remains regarding the effect of the supreme court s decision on the epa s b regulations for existing power plants and what technologies or other measures will be needed to satisfy section b regulations 
the epa also is in the process of updating its technology based regulations regarding discharges from power plants 
the epa has collected information from numerous power plants to inform this rulemaking 
the new standards have not yet been proposed 
accordingly  we cannot predict their effect on our business 
at our shawville  pennsylvania facility  we could be required to install a cooling tower by late at one or more of its units in order to comply with our permit 
if we decide to install one or more cooling towers  we could invest approximately million  primarily during to under current and forecasted market conditions  such capital expenditures may not be justified 
we are continuing to evaluate alternatives and appealing the permit 
see discussion below under shawville npdes permit appeal 
once through cooling 
in october  the california state water resources control board s state water board s policy on the use of coastal and estuarine waters for power plant cooling once through cooling policy became effective 
compliance options for our affected generating units include transitioning to a closed cycle cooling system  retiring  or submitting an alternative plan that meets equivalent mitigation criteria 
the specified compliance date for our pittsburg and contra costa generating facilities is december   and for our mandalay and ormond beach generating facilities the date is december  we will shut down the contra costa generating facility in april  subject to regulatory approval 
we are analyzing compliance options for the remaining affected generating units  and for certain of our california generating facilities the once through cooling policy could have a material adverse effect on how we operate those facilities and the costs of operating those facilities 
in october  we and several other companies jointly filed a lawsuit in california superior court challenging the state water board s issuance of the once through cooling policy on various procedural and substantive grounds 
the lawsuit seeks a writ directing the state water board to vacate and set aside approval of the once through cooling policy 
endangered species acts 
genon delta s use of water from the sacramento san joaquin delta at its contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities potentially affects certain fish species protected under the federal endangered species act and the california endangered species act 
genon delta therefore must maintain authorization under both statutes to engage in operations that could result in a take of ie  cause harm to fish of the protected species 
in january and february  genon delta received correspondence from the united states fish and wildlife service and the us army corps of engineers expressing the view that the federal endangered species act take authorization for the contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities was no longer in effect as a result of changed circumstances 
genon delta disagreed with the agencies characterization of its take authorization as no longer being in effect 
in october  genon delta received correspondence from the united states fish and wildlife service  the national marine fisheries service and the army corps of engineers clarifying that genon delta continued to be authorized to take four species of fish protected under the federal endangered species act 
the agencies have initiated a process that will review the environmental effects of genon delta s water usage  including effects on the protected species of fish 
that process could lead to changes in the manner in which genon delta can use river water for the 
table of contents operation of the contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities 
as discussed further in note c to our consolidated financial statements  we plan to shut down the contra costa generating facility in april by letter dated september   the coalition for a sustainable delta  four water districts  and an individual the delta noticing parties provided notice to us of their intent to file suit alleging that genon delta has violated  and continues to violate  the federal endangered species act through the operation of its contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities 
the delta noticing parties contend that the facilities use of water drawn from the sacramento san joaquin delta for cooling purposes results in harm to four species of fish listed as endangered species 
the delta noticing parties assert that genon delta s authorizations to take ie  cause harm to those species  a biological opinion and incidental take statement issued by the national marine fisheries service on october   for three of the fish species and a biological opinion and incidental take statement issued by the united states fish and wildlife service on november   for the fourth fish species  have been violated by genon delta and no longer apply to permit the effects on the four fish species caused by the operation of the contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities 
following receipt of these letters  genon delta received in october the correspondence noted above from the united states fish and wildlife service  the national marine fisheries service and the united states army corps of engineers the corps clarifying genon delta s continuing right to take the four species of fish 
in a subsequent letter  the coalition for a sustainable delta also alleged violations of the national environmental policy act and the california endangered species act associated with the operation of genon delta s generating facilities 
on may   the coalition for a sustainable delta  kern county water agency and an individual sent a new notice of intent to sue to the corps alleging that the corps had violated the federal endangered species act by issuing permits related to the operation of genon delta s contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities without ensuring that conservation measures would be implemented to minimize and mitigate the harm to the four endangered fish species and their habitat allegedly resulting from such operation 
genon delta disputes the allegations made by the delta noticing parties and those made in the may  notice 
on february   genon delta entered into a settlement agreement with the delta noticing parties  the parties to the may  notice of intent to sue  and the corps 
the settlement agreement provides for the delta noticing parties and the parties to the may  notice of intent to sue to withdraw the two notices of intent to sue and to release all claims described in those notices 
the settlement agreement obligated genon delta to seek approval from the corps  the united states fish and wildlife service  and the national marine fisheries service to amend its plan then in effect for monitoring entrainment and impingement of aquatic species caused by the operation of its generating facilities to increase monitoring during periods the facilities are operating  and those approvals have been obtained 
the settlement agreement requires the corps to use its best efforts to conclude ongoing consultations with the united states fish and wildlife service and the national marine fisheries service regarding the environmental effects of genon delta s water usage in a timely manner and allows the delta noticing parties and the parties to the may  notice of intent to sue to issue new notices of intent to sue if such consultations are not completed by october  in november  genon delta signed a second amendment to a memorandum of agreement with the california department of fish and game 
the amendment requires genon delta to prepare a planning and feasibility study for potential habitat restoration projects and extends by months to march   the deadline for submitting an application for a new permit authorizing genon delta to take the protected fish species affected by the operation of its facilities 
the amendment extends genon delta s existing authorization for take of fish species protected under the california endangered species act until the california department of fish and game completes its consideration of the application for the new permit 
potrero national pollution discharge elimination system permit 
on june   bayview hunters point community advocates and communities for a better environment filed a petition challenging the issuance of the npdes permit for our potrero generating facility 
on february   bayview hunters point community advocates and communities for a better environment filed another petition with a request to amend their initial petition 
on march   the california state water resources control board notified the parties that petitioners requested that as of march   the two petitions be moved from active status to abeyance 
those petitions currently remain in abeyance 
additionally  on june   
table of contents bayview hunters point community advocates and communities for a better environment and san francisco baykeeper filed a third petition requesting that the npdes permits for potrero and genon delta s pittsburg generating facility be reopened 
the state water resources control board denied that petition on november  as discussed further in notes and to our consolidated financial statements  the caiso has determined that the potrero generating facility is no longer needed for reliability and  accordingly  we shut it down on february  kendall npdes and surface water discharge permit 
on september   the epa issued to genon kendall an npdes renewal permit for the kendall cogeneration facility 
the same permit was concurrently issued by the madep as a state swd permit  and was accompanied by madep s earlier issued water quality certificate under section of the clean water act 
these permits sought to impose new temperature limits at various points in the charles river  an extensive temperature  water quality and biological monitoring program and a requirement to develop and install a barrier net system to reduce fish impingement and entrainment 
the provisions regulating the thermal discharge could have caused substantial curtailments of the operations of the kendall generating facility 
genon kendall appealed the permits in three proceedings a appeal of the npdes permit to the epa s environmental appeals board  b appeal of the swd permit to the madep  and c appeal of the water quality certification to the madep 
the effect of the permits was stayed pending the outcome of these appeals 
on march   the epa and the madep issued a draft permit modification to address the b provisions of the permit that would have required modifications to the intake structure for the kendall generating facility to add fine and coarse mesh barrier exclusion technologies and to install a mechanism to sweep organisms away from the intake structure through an induced water flow 
on may   genon kendall submitted comments on the draft permit modification objecting to the new requirements 
on december   the epa and the madep issued final permit modifications to address the b regulations 
those final permit modifications did not substantially modify the requirements proposed in the draft modifications  and on february   genon kendall filed an appeal of those modifications 
in october  genon kendall submitted a permit modification request to the epa and madep that requested modification of the permits as previously modified in to reflect revised permit terms agreed upon among genon kendall  the epa and madep as part of a settlement of the permit renewal proceedings pending before epa and madep 
the settlement contemplates that an additional steam pipeline will be installed across the charles river under the longfellow bridge to allow genon kendall to make additional steam sales to trigen boston energy corporation in boston and that genon kendall will install a back pressure steam turbine and air cooled condenser at the kendall generating facility 
this new pipeline and equipment once operational  would allow genon kendall to reduce significantly its use of water from the charles river 
on october   epa and madep issued the proposed revised permits the kendall permits as draft permit modifications for public comment 
on december   the epa and madep issued final permits that became effective on february  the kendall permits will limit genon kendall to drawing no more than million gallons of water per day from the river under normal operations  impose temperature limits similar to the permits  and require monitoring of temperatures at various points in the river when the kendall generating facility is discharging water to the river 
the kendall permits do not require the installation of barrier nets or modifications to the intake structure at the facility 
because river water will no longer be used for once through cooling under normal operations once the new pipeline and equipment have been installed  genon kendall expects the kendall permits to impose significantly less risk that operations of the facility would have to be curtailed to maintain compliance with the temperature limits 
as part of its settlement with the epa and madep  the epa and madep issued administrative orders that defer application of the new limit on the amount of river water used by the kendall cogenerating facility and the new temperature limits imposed by the kendall permits until installation has been completed of the new pipeline  the back pressure steam turbine  and the air cooled condenser  which is not expected to occur until canal npdes and swd permit 
on august   the epa issued to genon canal an npdes renewal permit for the canal generating facility 
the same permit was concurrently issued by madep as a state swd permit  and was accompanied by madep s earlier water quality certificate under section of 
table of contents the clean water act 
the new permit imposes a requirement on genon canal to install closed cycle cooling or an alternative technology that will reduce the entrainment of marine organisms by the canal generating facility to levels equivalent to what would be achieved by closed cycle cooling 
genon canal appealed the npdes permit to the epa s environmental appeals board and appealed the surface water discharge and the water quality certificate to the madep 
on december   the epa requested a stay to the appeal proceedings and withdrew provisions related to the closed cycle cooling requirements 
the epa has re noticed these provisions as draft conditions for additional public comment 
genon canal filed comments on january   stating that installing closed cycle cooling at the canal generating facility was not justified and that without some cost recovery mechanism the cost would make continued operation of the facility uneconomic 
while the appeals of the renewal permit are pending  the effect of any contested permit provisions is stayed and the canal generating facility will continue to operate under its current npdes permit 
we are unable to predict the outcome of this proceeding 
conemaugh npdes permit 
in april  two environmental groups sued genon northeast management company in the united states district court for the western district of pennsylvania alleging the inappropriate discharge of five metals to the conemaugh river from the conemaugh generating facility 
we think that an administrative consent order and agreement signed in precludes this lawsuit and the two plaintiffs do not have standing 
in october  the court denied our motion to dismiss on these two grounds 
a trial has been scheduled for june seward npdes permit appeal 
the padep issued the seward generating facility a renewed npdes permit on july  on september   pennenvironment  defenders of wildlife and the sierra club challenged this permit 
these environmental groups assert that there was insufficient public notice of the final permit 
they also assert that padep failed to a undertake a case by case analysis to set technology based effluent limitations  b require sufficient monitoring of temperature changes or a compliance schedule or to otherwise address certain alleged violations  c address the discharge of underground seeps to groundwater and d properly consider the need for additional water quality based effluent limitations 
we disagree with these allegations and think that all of the issues raised have been adequately and appropriately addressed 
shawville npdes permit appeal 
the padep issued the shawville generating facility a renewed npdes permit on august  that permit requires installation of cooling towers or reduction in plant operation by september  to reduce thermal effects on the west branch of the susquehanna river  which the shawville generating facility uses for cooling water 
we have appealed the permit because the deadlines for installation of cooling towers are both unachievable and inconsistent with the timeframe for making investment decisions regarding anticipated air quality regulations the transport rule  which is expected to replace the cair  and the mact rule  which is expected to regulate emissions of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants 
in addition  the pennsylvania fish boat commission appealed the permit  alleging that the schedule for and form of thermal limits on the plant are not sufficiently stringent 
npdes and state pollutant discharge elimination system permit renewals 
in addition to the various npdes proceedings described above  proceedings are currently pending for renewal of the npdes or state pollutant discharge elimination system permits at many of our generating facilities and ash disposal sites 
in general  the epa and the state agencies responsible for implementing the provisions of the clean water act applicable to the intake of water and discharge of effluent by electric generating facilities have been making the requirements imposed upon such facilities more stringent over time 
with respect to each of these permit renewal proceedings  the permit renewal proceeding could take years to resolve and the agency or agencies involved could impose requirements upon the entity owning the facility that require significant capital expenditures  limit the times at which the facility can operate  or increase operations and maintenance costs materially 
byproducts  wastes  hazardous materials and contamination our facilities are subject to laws and regulations governing waste management 
the federal resource conservation and recovery act of and many analogous state laws contains comprehensive requirements for the handling of solid and hazardous wastes 
the generation of electricity produces non hazardous and 
table of contents hazardous materials  and we incur substantial costs to store and dispose of waste materials 
the epa and the states in which we operate coal fired units may develop new regulations that impose additional requirements on facilities that store or dispose of materials remaining after the combustion of fossil fuels  including coal ash 
if so  we may be required to change our current waste management practices at some facilities and incur additional costs 
in june  the epa proposed two alternatives for regulating byproducts of coal combustion eg  ash and gypsum under the federal resource conservation and recovery act of under the first proposal  these byproducts would be regulated as solid wastes 
under the second proposal  these byproducts would be regulated as special wastes in a manner similar to the regulation of hazardous waste with an exception for beneficial reuse of these byproducts 
the second alternative would impose significantly more stringent requirements on and increase materially the cost of disposal of coal combustion byproducts 
our contra costa  pittsburg and potrero generating facilities have areas of soil and groundwater contamination 
in  prior to our acquisition of those facilities from pg e  consultants for pg e conducted soil and groundwater investigations at those facilities which revealed contamination 
the consultants conducting the investigation estimated the aggregate cleanup costs at those facilities could be as much as million 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement with pg e  pg e has responsibility for the containment or capping of all soil and groundwater contamination and the disposition of up to  cubic yards of contaminated soil from the potrero generating facility and the remediation of any groundwater or solid contamination identified by pg e s consultants in at the contra costa and pittsburg generating facilities  before those facilities were purchased in by our subsidiaries 
pursuant to our requests  pg e has disposed of cubic yards of contaminated soil from the potrero generating facility 
we are not aware of soil or groundwater conditions at our contra costa  pittsburg and potrero generating facilities for which we expect remediation costs to be material that are not the responsibility of other parties 
in  we closed and then demolished the lovett generating facility in new york 
pursuant to an agreement with the new york state department of environmental conservation in  we assessed the environmental condition of the property 
we do not yet know what  if any  remediation will be required for the lovett property 
we are responsible for environmental costs related to site contamination investigations and remediation requirements at four generating facilities in new jersey 
we recorded the estimated long term liability for the remediation costs of million at december  other 
as a result of their age  many of our plants contain significant amounts of asbestos insulation  other asbestos containing materials  as well as lead based paint 
we think we properly manage and dispose of such materials in compliance with state and federal rules 
see note d to our consolidated financial statements 
additionally  cercla  also known as the superfund law  establishes a federal framework for dealing with the cleanup of contaminated sites 
many states have enacted similar state superfund statutes as well as other laws imposing obligations to investigate and clean up contamination 
we do not think we have any material liabilities or obligations under cercla or similar state laws 
these laws impose clean up and restoration liability on owners and operators of plants from or at which there has been a release or threatened release of hazardous substances  together with those who have transported or arranged for the disposal of those substances 

table of contents employees at february   we employed  people  which included approximately  employees at our generating facilities  employees at our regional offices and employees at our corporate headquarters in houston  texas

in addition  the new agreement provides for a change to the postretirement healthcare benefit plan covering mid atlantic union employees to eliminate employer provided healthcare subsidies through a gradual phase out 
as a result of the shut down of the potrero generating facility  we will be downsizing the bargaining unit workforce consistent with an agreement negotiated with local in august  we entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with employees represented by ibew local the previous collective bargaining agreement expired on june  after reaching impasse in negotiations with the union  we imposed terms effective january   under which the employees worked without disruption 
the new agreement is substantially the same as the imposed contract 
in june  the uwua local representing the employees at the canal generating facility in sandwich  massachusetts  merged with the uwua local the uwua local also represents our employees at the kendall generating facility in a separate bargaining unit and each facility is covered by its own collective bargaining agreement 
to mitigate and reduce the risk of disruption during labor negotiations  we engage in contingency planning for operation of our generating facilities to the extent possible during an adverse collective action by one or more of our unions

risk factors 
we are subject to the following factors that could affect our future performance and results of operations 
also  see cautionary statement regarding forward looking information on page vii  business in item and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this form k 
risks related to the operation of our business the merger that created genon may not achieve its intended results  and we may be unable to integrate successfully mirant s and rri energy s operations 
achieving the anticipated benefits of the merger that created genon depends on whether the businesses of rri energy and mirant can be integrated in an efficient and effective manner 
integration of the two companies could take longer than anticipated and could result in the loss of valuable employees  the disruption of our ongoing businesses  processes and systems or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures  practices  policies and compensation arrangements  any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the merger 
we may have difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies 
many of our employees are in new positions following the merger and are required to comply with policies that are new to them  including policies related to risk management 
the integration process is subject to a number of uncertainties  and no assurance can be given that the anticipated benefits will be realized or  if realized  the timing of their realization 
failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenues and could adversely affect our future business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
our revenues are unpredictable because most of our generating facilities operate without long term power sales agreements  and our revenues and results of operations depend on market and competitive forces that are beyond our control 
we provide energy  capacity  ancillary and other energy services from our generating facilities into competitive power markets either on a short term fixed price basis or through power sales agreements 
our revenues from selling capacity are a significant part of our overall revenues 
we are not guaranteed recovery of our costs or any return on our capital investments through mandated rates 
the market for wholesale electric energy and energy services reflects various market conditions beyond our control  including the balance of supply and demand  our competitors marginal and long term costs of production  and the effect of market regulation 
the price at which we can sell our output may fluctuate on a day to day basis  and our ability to transact may be affected by the overall liquidity in the markets in which we operate 
these markets remain subject to regulations that limit our ability to raise prices during periods of shortage to the degree that would occur in a fully deregulated market  which may limit our ability to recover costs and an adequate return 
table of contents on our investment 
in addition  unlike most other commodities  electric energy can be stored only on a very limited basis and generally must be produced at the time of use 
as a result  the wholesale power markets are subject to substantial price fluctuations over relatively short periods of time and can be unpredictable 
for further discussion  see business competitive environment 
our revenues and results of operations are influenced by factors that are beyond our control  including the failure of market regulators to develop and maintain efficient mechanisms to compensate merchant generators for the value of providing capacity needed to meet demand  actions by regulators  isos  rtos and other bodies that may artificially modify supply and demand levels and prevent capacity and energy prices from rising to the level necessary for recovery of our costs  our investment and an adequate return on our investment  legal and political challenges to or changes in the rules used to calculate capacity payments in the markets in which we operate or the establishment of bifurcated markets  incentives  other market design changes or bidding requirements that give preferential treatment to new generating facilities over existing generating facilities or otherwise reduce capacity payments to existing generating facilities  the ability of wholesale purchasers of power to make timely payment for energy or capacity  which may be adversely affected by factors such as retail rate caps  refusals by regulators to allow utilities to recover fully their wholesale power costs and investments through rates  catastrophic losses and losses from investments by utilities in unregulated businesses  increases in prevailing market prices for fuel oil  coal  natural gas and emissions allowances that may not be reflected in prices we receive for sales of energy  increases in electricity supply as a result of actions of our current competitors or new market entrants  including the development of new generating facilities or alternative energy sources that may be able to produce electricity less expensively than our generating facilities and improvements in transmission that allow additional supply to reach our markets  increases in credit standards  margin requirements  market volatility or other market conditions that could increase our obligations to post collateral beyond amounts that are expected  including additional collateral costs associated with otc hedging activities as a result of otc regulations adopted pursuant to the dodd frank act  decreases in energy consumption resulting from demand side management programs such as automated demand response  which may alter the amount and timing of consumer energy use  the competitive advantages of certain competitors  including continued operation of older power facilities in strategic locations after recovery of historic capital costs from ratepayers  existing or future regulation of our markets by the ferc  isos and rtos  including any price limitations and other mechanisms to address some of the price volatility or illiquidity in these markets or the physical stability of the system  regulatory policies of state agencies that affect the willingness of our customers to enter into long term contracts generally  and contracts for capacity in particular  changes in the rate of growth in electricity usage as a result of such factors as national and regional economic conditions and implementation of conservation programs  seasonal variations in energy and natural gas prices  and capacity payments  and seasonal fluctuations in weather  in particular abnormal weather conditions 

table of contents some of our existing generating facilities may have a limited life unless we make significant capital expenditures to increase their commercial and environmental performance which may not be justified under current market rules and conditions 
most of our existing generating facilities in california depend almost entirely on payments in support of system reliability 
the energy market  as currently constituted  will not justify the capital expenditures necessary to repower or reconstruct these facilities to make them commercially viable in a merchant market and to meet future environmental requirements 
if a commercially reasonable capacity market were to be instituted by the caiso or we could obtain a contract with a creditworthy buyer  it is possible that we could justify investing the necessary capital to repower or reconstruct these facilities 
absent that  most of our existing generating facilities in california will be commercially viable only as long as they are necessary for reliability 
as discussed further in note c to our consolidated financial statements  we plan to shut down the contra costa generating facility in april and we shut down the potrero generating facility on february  our generating facilities face lower levels of profitability under current and forecasted market conditions and some of our generating facilities may not justify the capital expenditures to make them commercially viable and or to meet possible environmental requirements 
changes in the wholesale energy market or in our facility operations could result in impairments 
if our outlook for the wholesale energy market changes negatively  or if our ongoing evaluation of our business results in decisions to mothball  retire or dispose of facilities  we could have impairment charges related to our fixed assets  including the assets of rri energy that were recorded at provisional fair values in conjunction with the merger 
these evaluations involve significant judgments about the future 
actual future market prices  project costs and other factors could be materially different from our current estimates 
furthermore  increasing environmental regulatory requirements could result in facilities being removed from service or derated 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview in item of this form k and note to our consolidated financial statements 
our marsh landing development project is subject to construction risks and  if we are unsuccessful in addressing those risks  we may not recover our investment in the project or our return on the project may be lower than expected 
under its long term ppa with pg e  genon marsh landing bears the risk of completing the construction of the generating facility by the required completion date under the ppa 
genon marsh landing has posted a letter of credit of million to pg e to secure its contingent obligations for delay damages or termination payments under the ppa  which amounts were million at december   and escalate over the construction period 
genon marsh landing has also posted a letter of credit and provided a guaranty of genon energy holdings to the contractor at december  of million and million  respectively  to secure its obligations under the epc agreement for the marsh landing project 
genon marsh landing has also posted surety bonds totaling million to pg e to secure obligations related to transmission system upgrades and interconnection services 
if genon marsh landing does not complete the construction of the marsh landing generating facility by the required completion date under the ppa  our return on the project may be lower than expected 
should the facility fail to be operational by the required date under the ppa or not perform as required under the terms of the ppa  pg e may have the right to terminate the ppa 
as there is currently no wholesale capacity market in california  if pg e were to terminate the ppa  our return on the project might be materially lower than expected 

table of contents we are exposed to the risk of fuel and fuel transportation cost increases and volatility and interruption in fuel supply because our generating facilities generally do not have long term agreements for the supply of natural gas  coal and oil and rely on other parties for transportation 
although we purchase fuel based on our expected fuel requirements  we still face the risks of supply interruptions and fuel price volatility 
our cost of fuel may not reflect changes in energy and fuel prices in part because we must pre purchase inventories of coal and oil for reliability and dispatch requirements  and thus the price of fuel may have been determined at an earlier date than the price of energy generated from it 
the price we can obtain from the sale of energy may not rise at the same rate  or may not rise at all  to match a rise in fuel costs 
this may have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
the volatility of fuel prices could adversely affect our financial results and operations 
for our coal fired generating facilities  we purchase most of our coal from a small number of suppliers under contracts with terms of varying lengths  some of which extend to and one that extends to there is risk that our coal suppliers may not provide the contractual quantities on the dates specified within the agreements  or the deliveries may be carried over to future periods 
if our coal suppliers do not perform in accordance with the agreements  we may have to procure coal in the market to meet our needs  or power in the market to meet our obligations 
in addition  generally our coal suppliers do not have investment grade credit ratings nor do they post collateral with us and  accordingly  we may have limited ability to collect damages in the event of default by such suppliers 
non performance or default risk by our coal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
for a discussion of our coal supplier concentration risk  see note to our consolidated financial statements in this form k 
for our oil fired generating facilities  we typically purchase fuel from a limited number of suppliers under contracts with terms of varying lengths 
if our oil suppliers do not perform in accordance with the agreements  we may have to procure oil in the market to meet our needs  or power in the market to meet our obligations 
for our gas fired generating facilities  any curtailments or interruptions on transporting pipelines could result in curtailment of our operations or increased fuel supply costs 
operation of our generating facilities involves risks that may have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations 
the operation of our generating facilities involves various operating risks  including  but not limited to the output and efficiency levels at which those generating facilities perform  interruptions in fuel supply and quality of available fuel  disruptions in the delivery of electricity  adverse zoning  breakdowns or equipment failures whether a result of age or otherwise  violations of our permit requirements or changes in the terms of  or revocation of  permits  releases of pollutants and hazardous substances to air  soil  surface water or groundwater  ability to transport and dispose of coal ash at reasonable prices  curtailments or other interruptions in natural gas supply  shortages of equipment or spare parts  labor disputes  including strikes  work stoppages and slowdowns  the aging workforce at certain of our facilities  operator errors  curtailment of operations because of transmission constraints  
table of contents failures in the electricity transmission system which may cause large energy blackouts  implementation of unproven technologies in connection with environmental improvements  and catastrophic events such as fires  explosions  floods  earthquakes  hurricanes or other similar occurrences 
a decrease in  or the elimination of  the revenues generated by our facilities or an increase in the costs of operating them could materially affect our cash flows and results of operations  including cash flows available to us to make payments on our debt or our other obligations 
we are exposed to possible losses that may occur from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contractual arrangement with us  particularly in connection with our non collateralized power hedges between genon mid atlantic and financial institutions 
we are exposed to possible losses from the failure of a counterparty to perform according to the terms of a contractual arrangement with us  particularly in connection with our non collateralized power hedges between genon mid atlantic and financial institutions 
non collateralized power hedges represent of our net notional power position at december  such hedges are senior unsecured obligations of genon mid atlantic and the counterparties  and do not require either party to post cash collateral for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices 
deterioration in the financial condition of our counterparties and any resulting failure to pay amounts owed to us or to perform obligations or services owed to us beyond collateral posted could have a negative effect on our business and financial condition 
we are subject to adverse developments in the regions in which we operate  especially the pjm market 
at december   our generating capacity was in pjm  in caiso  in the southeast  in miso and in nyiso and iso ne 
adverse developments in these regions  especially in the pjm market where most of our revenues are derived  may adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
the effect of such adverse regional developments may be greater on us than on our more diversified competitors 
our income tax nol carry forwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change as defined in the irc 
we have approximately billion of federal nol carry forwards  which we are able to use to offset taxable income in future years 
if  however  an ownership change  as defined in irc section irc  occurs  the amount of nols that could be used in any one year following such ownership change would be substantially limited 
in general  an ownership change would occur when there is a greater than percentage point increase in ownership of a company s stock by stockholders each of which owns or is deemed to own under irc or more of such company s stock 
given irc s broad definition  an ownership change could be the unintended consequence of otherwise normal market trading in our stock that is outside our control 
moreover  while we have a stockholder rights plan in place in an effort to preserve our nols  the stockholder rights plan can only deter  not prevent  an ownership change that would result in the loss of our nols

competition in wholesale power markets may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we compete with non utility generators  regulated utilities  and other energy service companies in the sale of our products and services  as well as in the procurement of fuel and transmission services 
we compete primarily on the basis of price and service 
regulated utilities in the wholesale markets generally enjoy a lower cost of capital than we do and often are able to recover fixed costs through regulated retail rates  including  in many cases  the costs of generation  allowing them to build  buy and upgrade generating facilities without relying exclusively on market clearing prices to recover their investments 
the competitive advantages 
table of contents of such participants could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively and could have an adverse effect on the revenues generated by our facilities 
changes in technology may significantly affect our generating business by making our generating facilities less competitive 
we generate electricity using fossil fuels at large central facilities 
this method results in economies of scale and lower costs than newer technologies such as fuel cells  microturbines  windmills and photovoltaic solar cells 
it is possible that advances in those technologies  or governmental incentives for renewable energies  will reduce their costs to levels that are equal to or below that of most central station electricity production  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the expected decommissioning and or site remediation obligations of certain of our generating facilities may negatively affect our cash flows 
some of our generating facilities and related properties are subject to decommissioning and or site remediation obligations that may require material expenditures 
furthermore  laws and regulations may change to impose material additional decommissioning and remediation obligations on us in the future 
if we are required to make material expenditures to decommission or remediate one or more of our facilities  such obligations will affect our cash flows and may adversely affect our ability to make payments on our obligations 
terrorist attacks  future wars or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations  our ability to raise capital or our future growth 
as a power generator  we face heightened risk of an act of terrorism  either a direct act against one of our generating facilities or an act against the transmission and distribution infrastructure that is used to transport our power  which would cause an inability to operate as a result of systemic damage 
further  we rely on information technology networks and systems to operate our generating facilities  engage in asset management activities  and process  transmit and store electronic information 
security breaches of this information technology infrastructure  including cyber attacks and cyber terrorism  could lead to system disruptions  generating facility shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information 
if such an attack or security breach were to occur  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  such an attack could affect our ability to service our indebtedness  our ability to raise capital and our future growth opportunities 
our operations are subject to hazards customary to the power generating industry 
we may not have adequate insurance to cover all of these hazards 
power generation involves hazardous activities  including acquiring  transporting and unloading fuel  operating large pieces of high speed rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems 
in addition to natural risks such as earthquake  flood  storm surge  lightning  hurricane  tornado and wind  hazards such as fire  explosion  collapse and machinery failure are inherent risks in our operations 
these hazards can cause significant injury to personnel or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property  plant and equipment  contamination of  or damage to  the environment and suspension of operations 
the occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages  environmental cleanup costs  personal injury and fines and or penalties 
we maintain an amount of insurance protection that we consider adequate  but we cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject 
a hazard or liability for which we are not fully insured could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and our financial condition 

table of contents lawsuits  regulatory proceedings and tax proceedings could adversely affect our future financial results 
from time to time  we are named as a party to  or our property is the subject of  lawsuits  regulatory proceedings or tax proceedings 
we are currently involved in various proceedings which involve highly subjective matters with complex factual and legal questions 
their outcome is uncertain 
any claim that is successfully asserted against us could require significant expenditures by us and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
even if we prevail  any proceedings could be costly and time consuming  could divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and could result in adverse changes in our insurance costs  which could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements 
if we acquire or develop additional facilities  dispose of existing facilities or combine with other businesses  we may incur additional costs and risks 
we may seek to purchase or develop additional facilities  dispose of existing facilities  or combine with other businesses 
there is no assurance that these efforts will be successful 
in addition  these activities involve risks and challenges  including identifying suitable opportunities  obtaining required regulatory and other approvals  integrating acquired or combined operations with our own  and increasing expenses and working capital requirements 
furthermore  in any sale  we may be required to indemnify a purchaser against liabilities 
to finance future acquisitions  we may be required to issue additional equity securities or incur additional debt 
obtaining such additional financing is dependent on numerous factors  including general economic and capital market conditions  credit availability from financial institutions  the covenants in our debt agreements  and our financial performance  cash flow and credit ratings 
we cannot make any assurances that we would be able to obtain such additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
risks related to economic and financial market conditions the failure of the lenders under our undrawn credit facilities to perform could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations 
we are exposed to systemic risk of the financial markets and institutions and the risk of non performance of the individual lenders under our undrawn credit facilities 
maintaining sufficient liquidity in our business for maintenance and operating expenditures  capital expenditures and collateral is crucial in order to mitigate the risk of future financial distress to us 
accordingly  we maintain a revolving credit facility to manage our expected liquidity needs and contingencies as described in more detail in this form k 
the failure of our lenders to perform under our revolving credit facility could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in the event that financial institutions are unwilling or unable to renew our existing revolving credit facility or enter into new revolving credit facilities  our ability to hedge economically our assets or engage in proprietary trading could also be impaired 
a significant portion of the marsh landing project costs are expected to be funded through drawings under the genon marsh landing credit facility 
the failure of the lenders to perform under that credit facility and related interest rate swaps could have a material adverse effect on the ability to complete construction of the marsh landing facility or on the expected return on that investment 
as financial institutions consolidate and operate under more restrictive capital constraints and regulations  there could be less liquidity in the energy and commodity markets  which could have a negative effect on our ability to hedge economically and transact with creditworthy counterparties 
we hedge economically a substantial portion of our eastern pjm coal fired baseload generation and certain of our other generation 
a significant portion of our hedges are financial swap transactions between genon mid atlantic and financial counterparties that are senior unsecured obligations of such parties and do not require either party to post cash collateral  either for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices 
in recent years  global financial institutions have been active participants in these energy and commodity markets 
as such financial institutions consolidate and operate under more restrictive capital constraints and regulations  there could be less liquidity in the energy and 
table of contents commodity markets  which could have a negative effect on our ability to hedge economically and transact with creditworthy counterparties 
the dodd frank act could materially affect our business  including greater regulation of energy contracts and otc derivative financial instruments  which could materially affect our ability to hedge economically our generation 
the dodd frank act  which was enacted in july in response to the global financial crisis  increases the regulation of transactions involving otc derivative financial instruments 
the statute provides that standardized swap transactions between dealers and large market participants will have to be cleared and traded on an exchange or electronic platform 
although the provisions and legislative history of the dodd frank act provide strong evidence that market participants  such as the company  which utilize otc derivative financial instruments to hedge commercial risks are not to be subject to these clearing and exchange trading requirements  it is uncertain what the final implementing regulations to be issued by the cftc and sec will provide 
the effect of the dodd frank act on our business depends in large measure on pending cftc and sec rulemaking proceedings and  in particular  the final definitions for the key terms swap dealer and major swap participant in the dodd frank act 
the cftc and sec issued a proposed rulemaking to set final definitions for the terms swap dealer and major swap participant  among others 
entities defined as swap dealers and major swap participants will face costly requirements for clearing and posting margin  as well as additional requirements for reporting and business conduct 
as proposed  the swap dealer definition in particular is ambiguous  subjective and could be broad enough to encompass some energy companies 
if applied to our hedging activity  such regulations could materially affect our ability to hedge economically our generation by reducing liquidity in the energy and commodity markets and  if we are required to clear such transactions on exchanges or meet other requirements  by significantly increasing the collateral costs associated with such activities 
changes in commodity prices may negatively affect our financial results by increasing the cost of producing power or lowering the price at which we are able to sell our power 
our generating business is subject to changes in power prices and fuel and emissions costs  and these commodity prices are influenced by many factors outside our control  including weather  seasonal variation in supply and demand  market liquidity  transmission and transportation inefficiencies  availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources  demand for energy commodities  production of natural gas  coal and crude oil  natural disasters  wars  embargoes and other catastrophic events  and federal  state and environmental regulation and legislation 
in addition  significant fluctuations in the price of natural gas may cause significant fluctuations in the price of electricity 
significant fluctuations in commodity prices may affect our financial results and financial position by increasing the cost of producing power and decreasing the amounts we receive from the sale of power 
our asset management activities will not fully protect us from fluctuations in commodity prices 
we engage in asset management activities related to sales of electricity and purchases of fuel 
the income and losses from these activities are recorded as operating revenues and fuel costs 
we may use forward contracts and other derivative financial instruments to manage market risk and exposure to volatility in prices of electricity  coal  natural gas  emissions and oil 
we cannot provide assurance that these strategies will be successful in managing our price risks  or that they will not result in net losses to us as a result of future volatility in electricity  fuel and emissions markets 
actual power prices and fuel costs may differ from our expectations 
our asset management activities include natural gas derivative financial instruments that we use to hedge economically power prices for our baseload generation 
the effectiveness of these hedges is dependent upon the correlation between power and natural gas prices in the markets where we operate 
if those prices are not sufficiently correlated  our financial results and financial position could be adversely affected 
see note to our consolidated financial statements and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of this form k 

table of contents additionally  we expect to have an open position in the market  within our established guidelines  resulting from our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities 
to the extent open positions exist  fluctuating commodity prices can affect our financial results and financial position  either favorably or unfavorably 
as a result of these and other factors  we cannot predict the outcome that risk management decisions may have on our business  operating results or financial position 
although management devotes considerable attention to these issues  their outcome is uncertain 
our policies and procedures cannot eliminate the risks associated with our hedging and proprietary trading activity 
the risk management procedures we have in place may not always be followed or may not always work as planned 
if any of our employees were able to violate our system of internal controls  including our risk management policy  and engage in unauthorized hedging and related activities  it could result in significant penalties and financial losses 
in addition  risk management tools and metrics such as value at risk  gross margin at risk  and stress testing are partially based on historic price movements 
if price movements significantly or persistently deviate from historical behavior  risk limits may not fully protect us from significant losses 
the accounting treatment of our asset management  proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities may increase the volatility of our quarterly and annual financial results 
we engage in asset management activities to hedge economically our exposure to market risk with respect to a electricity sales from our generating facilities  b fuel used by those facilities and c emissions allowances 
we generally attempt to balance our fixed price purchases and sales commitments in terms of contract volumes and the timing of performance and delivery obligations through the use of financial and physical derivative financial instruments 
we also use derivative financial instruments with respect to our limited proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities  through which we attempt to achieve incremental returns by transacting where we have specific market expertise 
derivatives from our asset management  proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities are recorded on our balance sheet at fair value pursuant to the accounting guidance for derivative financial instruments 
other than interest rate swaps into which we entered to manage our interest rate risk associated with our genon marsh landing project financing  which were designated as cash flow hedges  none of our other derivatives recorded at fair value is designated as a hedge under this guidance  and changes in their fair values currently are recognized in earnings as unrealized gains or losses 
as a result  our gaap financial results including gross margin  operating income and balance sheet ratios will  at times  be volatile and subject to fluctuations in value primarily because of changes in forward electricity and fuel prices 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
risks related to governmental regulation and laws our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant and can affect our future operations and financial results 
we are subject to extensive and evolving environmental regulations  particularly in regard to our coal and oil fired facilities 
failure to comply with environmental requirements could require us to shut down or reduce production at our facilities or create liabilities 
we incur significant costs in complying with these regulations and  if we fail to comply  could incur significant penalties 
our cost estimates for environmental compliance are based on existing regulations or our view of reasonably likely regulations  and our assessment of the costs of labor and materials and the state of evolving technologies 
our decision to make these investments is often subject to future market conditions 
changes to the preceding factors  new or revised environmental regulations  litigation and new legislation and or regulations  as well as other factors  could cause our actual costs to vary outside the range of our estimates  further constrain our operations  increase our environmental compliance costs and or make it uneconomical to operate some of our facilities 
environmental laws  particularly with respect to air emissions  disposal of ash  wastewater discharge and cooling water systems  are generally becoming more stringent  which may require us to make additional facility upgrades or restrict our operations 

table of contents we are required to surrender emission allowances equal to emissions of specific substances to operate our facilities 
surrender requirements may require purchase of allowances  which may be unavailable or only available at costs that would make it uneconomical to operate our facilities 
federal  state and regional initiatives to regulate greenhouse gas emissions could have a material impact on our financial performance and condition 
the actual impact will depend on a number of factors  including the overall level of greenhouse gas reductions required under any such regulations  the final form of the regulations or legislation  and the price and availability of emission allowances if allowances are a part of the final regulatory framework 
see business environmental matters in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview in item of this form k and note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain environmental laws  including the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of and comparable state laws  impose strict and  in many circumstances  joint and several liability for costs of remediating contamination 
some of our facilities have areas with known soil and or groundwater contamination 
releases of hazardous substances at our generating facilities  or at locations where we dispose of or in the past disposed of hazardous substances and other waste  could require us to spend significant sums to remediate contamination  regardless of whether we caused such contamination 
the discovery of significant contamination at our generating facilities  at disposal sites we currently use or have used  or at other locations for which we may be liable  or the failure or inability of parties contractually responsible to us for contamination to respond when claims or obligations regarding such contamination arise  could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and condition 
our coal fired generating units produce certain byproducts that involve extensive handling and disposal costs and are subject to government regulation 
changes in these regulations  or their administration  by legislatures  state and federal regulatory agencies  or other bodies may affect the costs of handling and disposing of these byproducts 
as a result of the coal combustion process  we produce significant quantities of ash at our coal fired generating units that must be disposed of at sites permitted to handle ash 
for most of our ash disposal  we use our own ash management facilities  which are all dry landfills to dispose of the ash  however  one of our landfills in maryland has reached design capacity and we expect that another one of our sites in maryland may reach full capacity in the next few years 
as a result  we have a plan to develop new ash management facilities and also commenced construction in february of a facility that is designed to prepare our ash from certain of our maryland facilities for beneficial uses 
however  the costs associated with purchasing new land and permitting the land to allow for ash disposal could be material  and the amount of time needed to obtain permits for the land could extend beyond the expected timeline 
likewise  the ongoing construction of a facility to prepare our ash for beneficial use may be delayed  cost more than expected or not operate as expected  or the ash may not be marketed and sold as expected 
additionally  costs associated with third party ash handling and disposal are material and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance and condition 
we also produce gypsum as a byproduct of the so scrubbing process at our coal fired generating facilities  which is sold to third parties for use in drywall production 
should our ability to sell such gypsum to third parties be restricted as a result of the lack of demand or otherwise  our gypsum disposal costs could rise materially 
the epa has proposed two alternatives for regulating byproducts such as ash and gypsum 
one of these alternatives would regulate these byproducts as special wastes in a manner similar to the regulation of hazardous wastes 
if these byproducts are regulated as special wastes  the cost of disposing of these byproducts would increase materially and may limit our ability to recycle them for beneficial use 
the epa expects to finalize this rule in late 
table of contents our business is subject to complex government regulations 
changes in these regulations  or their administration  by legislatures  state and federal regulatory agencies  or other bodies may affect the prices at which we are able to sell the electricity we produce  the costs of operating our generating facilities or our ability to operate our facilities 
we are subject to regulation by the ferc regarding the rates  terms and conditions of wholesale sales of electric capacity  energy and ancillary services and other matters  including mergers and acquisitions  the disposition of facilities under the ferc s jurisdiction and the issuance of securities  as well as by state agencies regarding physical aspects of our generating facilities 
the majority of our generation is sold at market prices under market based rate authority granted by the ferc 
if certain conditions are not met  the ferc has the authority to withhold or rescind market based rate authority and require sales to be made based on cost of service rates 
a loss of our market based rate authority could have a materially negative impact on our generating business 
even when market based rate authority has been granted  the ferc may impose various forms of market mitigation measures  including price caps and operating restrictions  when it determines that potential market power might exist and that the public interest requires such potential market power to be mitigated 
in addition to direct regulation by the ferc  most of our facilities are subject to rules and terms of participation imposed and administered by various isos and rtos 
although these entities are themselves ultimately regulated by the ferc  they can impose rules  restrictions and terms of service that are quasi regulatory in nature and can have a material adverse impact on our business 
for example  isos and rtos may impose bidding and scheduling rules  both to curb the potential exercise of market power and to ensure market functions 
such actions may materially affect our ability to sell and the price we receive for our energy  capacity and ancillary services 
to conduct our business  we must obtain and periodically renew licenses  permits and approvals for our facilities 
these licenses  permits and approvals can be in addition to any required environmental permits 
no assurance can be provided that we will be able to obtain and comply with all necessary licenses  permits and approvals for these facilities 
if we cannot comply with all applicable regulations  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
we cannot predict whether the federal or state legislatures will adopt legislation relating to the restructuring of the energy industry 
there are proposals in many jurisdictions that would either roll back or advance the movement toward competitive markets for the supply of electricity  at both the wholesale and retail levels 
in addition  any future legislation favoring large  vertically integrated utilities and a concentration of ownership of such utilities could affect our ability to compete successfully  and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
similarly  any regulations or laws that favor new generation over existing generation could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
risks related to level of indebtedness our substantial indebtedness and operating lease obligations could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations  limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from meeting or refinancing our obligations 
we have a substantial amount of indebtedness 
at december   our consolidated indebtedness was billion 
in addition  the present values of lease payments under the respective genon mid atlantic and rema operating leases were approximately million and million  respectively assuming a and discount rate  respectively and the termination value of the respective genon mid atlantic and rema operating leases was billion and million 

table of contents our substantial indebtedness and operating lease obligations could have important consequences for our liquidity  results of operations  financial position and prospects  including our ability to grow in accordance with our strategy 
these consequences include the following they may limit our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing for working capital  capital expenditures  debt service requirements  acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes  a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations must be dedicated to the payment of rent and principal and interest on our indebtedness and will not be available for other purposes  including our working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  the debt service requirements of our indebtedness could make it difficult for us to satisfy or refinance our financial obligations  certain of our borrowings  including borrowings under our senior secured credit facility  are at variable rates of interest  exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates  they may limit our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our industry  they may place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to other  less leveraged competitors  our new credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long term best interest  and we may be more vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out capital expenditures that are important to our long term growth or necessary to comply with environmental regulations 
genon and its subsidiaries that are holding companies  including genon americas generation  may not have access to sufficient cash to meet their obligations if their subsidiaries  in particular genon mid atlantic  are unable to make distributions 
we and certain of our subsidiaries  including genon americas generation  are holding companies and  as a result  are dependent upon dividends  distributions and other payments from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet our obligations 
in particular  a substantial portion of the cash from our operations is generated by genon mid atlantic 
the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions is restricted under the terms of their debt or other agreements  including the operating leases of genon mid atlantic and rema 
under their respective operating leases  genon mid atlantic and rema are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless a they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters  b they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters  commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made  and c no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 
in the event of a default under the respective operating leases or if the respective restricted payment tests are not satisfied  genon mid atlantic and rema would not be able to distribute cash 
at december   genon mid atlantic and rema satisfied the respective restricted payments tests 
we may be unable to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and to post required amounts of cash collateral necessary to hedge economically market risk 
our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt depends on our future operating performance 
if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to allow us to make scheduled payments on our debt  we may have to reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets  seek additional capital  restructure or refinance 
there can be no assurance that the terms of our debt will allow these alternative measures  that the financial markets will be available to us on acceptable terms or that such measures would satisfy our scheduled debt service obligations 
if we do not comply with the payment and other material covenants under our debt agreements  we could be required to repay our debt immediately and  in the case of our revolving credit facilities  the commitment to lend us money could terminate 

table of contents we seek to manage the risks associated with the volatility in the price at which we sell power produced by our generating facilities and in the prices of fuel  emissions allowances and other inputs required to produce such power by entering into hedging transactions 
these asset management activities may require us to post collateral either in the form of cash or letters of credit 
at december   we had approximately million of posted cash collateral and million of letters of credit outstanding under our revolving credit facility primarily to support our asset management activities  trading activities  rent reserve requirements and other commercial arrangements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our posted cash collateral and letters of credit 
although we seek to structure transactions in a way that reduces our potential liquidity needs for collateral  we may be unable to execute our hedging strategy successfully if we are unable to post the amount of collateral required to enter into and support hedging contracts 
we are an active participant in energy exchange and clearing markets 
these markets require a per contract initial margin to be posted  regardless of the credit quality of the participant 
the initial margins are determined by the exchanges through the use of proprietary models that rely on a variety of inputs and factors  including market conditions 
we have limited notice of any changes to the margin rates 
consequently  we are exposed to changes in the per unit margin rates required by the exchanges and could be required to post additional collateral on short notice 
the terms of our credit facilities restrict our current and future operations  particularly our ability to respond to changes or take certain actions 
our credit facilities contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long term best interest  including restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or make other distributions or repurchase or redeem capital stock  prepay  redeem or repurchase certain debt  make loans and investments  sell assets  incur liens  enter into transactions with affiliates  enter into sale leaseback transactions  and consolidate  merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  the restrictive covenants in our credit facilities require us to maintain a ratio of consolidated secured debt net of up to million in cash to ebitda of not more than to  which will be tested at the end of each fiscal quarter and  in the case of ebitda  will be calculated on a rolling four fiscal quarter basis ending on the last day of such fiscal quarter 
our ability to meet that financial ratio can be affected by events beyond our control 
our failure to comply with the covenants in our credit facilities could result in an event of default under our credit facilities and any other debt to which a cross default or cross acceleration provision applies

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  which are in this form k 
the following tables present our selected consolidated financial information  which is derived from our consolidated financial statements 
upon completion of the merger  mirant stockholders had a majority of the voting interest in the combined company

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this section is intended to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements  the changes in those financial statements from year to year and the primary factors contributing to those changes 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes accompanying those financial statements 
merger of mirant and rri energy on december   mirant and rri energy completed their merger 
mirant merged with a wholly owned subsidiary of rri energy  with mirant surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of rri energy 
in connection with the all stock  tax free merger  rri energy changed its name to genon energy  inc  mirant stockholders received a fixed ratio of shares of genon common stock for each share of mirant common stock  and mirant changed its name to genon energy holdings 
although rri energy was the legal acquirer  the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition  and mirant was deemed to have acquired rri energy for accounting purposes 
as a consequence of the reverse acquisition accounting treatment  the historical financial statements presented for periods prior to the merger date are the historical statements of mirant  except for stockholders equity which has been retroactively adjusted for the equivalent number of shares of the legal acquirer 
the operations of the former rri energy businesses have been included in the financial statements from the date of the merger 
for a discussion of our strategy  see item  business strategy in this form k 
our business with approximately  mw of electric generating capacity  we operate across various fuel natural gas  coal and oil and technology types  operating characteristics and regional power markets 
at december   our generating capacity was in pjm  in caiso  in the southeast  in miso and in nyiso and iso ne 
we provide energy  capacity  ancillary and other energy services to wholesale customers in competitive energy markets in the united states  including isos and rtos  power aggregators  retail providers  electric cooperative utilities  other power generating companies and load serving entities 
our commercial operations consist primarily of dispatching electricity  hedging the generation and sale of electricity  procuring and managing fuel and providing logistical support for the operation of our facilities eg  by procuring transportation for coal and natural gas  as well as our proprietary trading operations 
we typically sell the electricity we produce into the wholesale market at prices in effect at the time we produce it spot price 
we use dispatch models to assist in making daily bidding decisions regarding the quantity and price of the power we offer to generate from our facilities and sell into the markets 
we bid the energy from our generating facilities into the hour ahead or day ahead energy market and sell ancillary services through the iso and rto markets 
we work with the isos and rtos in real time to ensure that our generating facilities are dispatched economically to meet the reliability needs of the market 
spot prices for electricity are volatile  as are prices for fuel and emissions allowances 
in order to reduce the risk of price volatility and achieve more predictable financial results  we have historically entered into economic hedges forward sales of electricity and forward purchases of fuel and emissions allowances to permit us to produce and sell the electricity to manage the risks associated with such volatility 
in addition  given the high correlation between natural gas prices and electricity prices in the markets in which we operate  we have entered into forward sales of natural gas to hedge economically exposure to changes in the price of electricity 
we procure hedges in otc transactions or on exchanges where electricity  fuel and emissions allowances are broadly traded  or through specific transactions with buyers and sellers  using futures  forwards  swaps and options 
we sell capacity either bilaterally or through periodic auctions in each iso and rto market in which we participate 
these capacity sales provide an important source of predictable revenues for us over the contracted 
table of contents period 
at january   total projected contracted capacity and ppa revenues for which prices have been set for through are billion 
in addition to the activities described above  we buy and sell some electricity  fuel and emissions allowances  sometimes through financial derivatives  as part of our proprietary trading  fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities 
we engage in proprietary trading to gain information about the markets in which we operate to support our asset management and to take advantage of selected opportunities that we identify 
we enter into fuel oil management activities to hedge economically the fair value of our physical fuel oil inventories  optimize the approximately three million barrels of storage capacity that we own or lease  as well as attempt to profit from market opportunities related to timing and or differences in the pricing of various products 
we engage in natural gas transportation and storage activities to optimize our physical natural gas and storage positions and manage the physical gas requirements for a portion of our assets 
proprietary trading  fuel oil management and natural gas transportation and storage activities together will typically comprise less than of our realized gross margin 
all of our commercial activities are governed by a comprehensive risk management policy  which includes limits on the size of volumetric positions and var for our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities 
for  the combined average daily var for proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities was million 
hedging activities we hedge economically a substantial portion of our eastern pjm coal fired baseload generation and certain of our other generation 
we generally do not hedge our intermediate and peaking units for tenors greater than months 
we hedge economically using products which we expect to be effective to mitigate the price risk of our generation 
however  as a result of market liquidity limitations  our hedges often are not an exact match for the generation being hedged  and  we then have some risks resulting from price differentials for different delivery points and for implied differences in heat rates when we hedge economically power using natural gas 
currently  a significant portion of our hedges are financial swap transactions between genon mid atlantic and financial counterparties that are senior unsecured obligations of such parties and do not require either party to post cash collateral either for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices 
at january   our aggregate hedge levels based on expected generation for each year were as follows power fuel percentages represent the period from february through december see item a  risk factors risks related to economic and financial market conditions for a discussion of the risks of consolidation of financial institutions and more restrictive capital constraints and regulation  which could have a negative effect on our ability to hedge economically with creditworthy counterparties  and the risks of implementation of the dodd frank act on our ability to hedge economically our generation  including potentially reducing liquidity in the energy and commodity markets and  if we are required to clear such transactions on exchanges or meet other requirements  by significantly increasing the collateral costs associated with such activities 
capital expenditures and capital resources for  we invested million for capital expenditures  excluding capitalized interest  of which million related to compliance with the maryland healthy air act 
at december   we have invested billion of the billion that was budgeted for capital expenditures related to compliance with the maryland healthy air act 
as the final part of our compliance with the maryland healthy air act  
table of contents we placed four scrubbers in service at our maryland facilities in the fourth quarter of provisions in the construction contracts for the scrubbers provide for certain payments to be made after final completion of the project 
the current budget of billion continues to represent our best estimate of the total capital expenditures for compliance with the maryland healthy air act 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of scrubber contract litigation 
for  our capitalized interest was million compared to million for the decrease in capitalized interest from is a result of placing our scrubbers in service at our maryland facilities in the fourth quarter of the following table details the expected timing of payments for our estimated capital expenditures  excluding capitalized interest not related to the marsh landing generating facility  for and in millions maryland healthy air act other environmental maintenance marsh landing generating facility other construction other total we expect that available cash and future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures 
however  we plan to fund a substantial portion of the capital expenditures for the marsh landing generating facility with approximately million of project financing debt into which we entered on october  see california development activities below for additional information on the marsh landing generating facility 
other environmental capital expenditures set forth above could significantly increase subject to the content and timing of final rules and future market conditions 
environmental matters we make decisions to invest capital for environmental controls based on relatively certain regulations and the expected economic returns on the capital 
as discussed in part of this form k under business regulatory environment environmental regulation  the effect on our business of pending epa regulations to replace the cair and whether we elect to install additional controls are uncertain and depend on the content and timing of the regulations  the expected effect of the regulations on wholesale power prices and allowance prices  as well as the cost of controls  profitability of our generating facilities  market conditions at the time and the likelihood of co regulation 
the epa has stated that it expects to finalize the regulations to replace the cair in we may choose to retire certain of our units rather than install additional controls 
the costs associated with more stringent environmental air quality requirements may result in coal fired generating facilities  including some of ours  being retired 
although conditions may change  under current and forecasted market conditions  installations of additional scrubbers would not be economic at most of our unscrubbed coal fired facilities 
any such retirements could contribute to improving supply and demand fundamentals for the remaining fleet 
any resulting increased demand for gas could increase the spread between gas and coal prices  which would also benefit the remaining coal fired generating facilities 
furthermore  federal  state specific or regional regulatory initiatives to stimulate co emission reductions in our industry are being considered 
the effect on our business of these matters is uncertain and depends on the form and content of resulting regulations  if any  including their effect on a wholesale electricity and emissions allowance prices and b other existing regulations such as the rggi 
if co regulation becomes more stringent  we expect that the demand for gas and or renewable sources of electricity will increase over time 
although we expect that market prices for electricity would increase following such regulation and would allow us to recover a portion of the resulting costs  we cannot predict 
table of contents with any certainty the actual increases in costs such regulation could impose upon us or our ability to recover such cost increases through higher market rates for electricity 
it is possible that congress will take action to regulate greenhouse gas emissions within the next several years 
the form and timing of any final legislation will be influenced by political and economic factors and are uncertain at this time 
implementation of a co cap and trade program in addition to other emission control requirements could increase the likelihood of coal fired generating facility retirements 
given the uncertainty related to these environmental matters  we cannot predict their actual outcome or ultimate effect on our business  and such matters could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
see business regulatory environment environmental regulation and risk factors risks related to governmental regulation and laws in items and a  respectively  of this form k and note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
commodity prices the prices for power and natural gas remain low compared to several years ago 
the energy gross margin from our generating facilities is negatively affected by these price levels 
for that portion of the volumes of generation that we have hedged  we are generally economically neutral to subsequent changes in commodity prices because our realized gross margin will reflect the contractual prices of our power and fuel contracts 
we continue to add economic hedges  including to maintain projected levels of cash flows from operations for future periods to help support continued compliance with the covenants in our debt and lease agreements 
california development activities genon marsh landing on september   genon marsh landing entered into a ten year ppa with pg e for mw of natural gas fired peaking generation to be constructed adjacent to our contra costa generating facility near antioch  california 
during the ten year term of the ppa  genon marsh landing will receive fixed monthly capacity payments and variable operating payments 
the contract provides pg e with the entire output of the mw generating facility  which is expected to be capable of producing mw during peak july conditions 
on may   genon marsh landing entered into an epc agreement with kiewit power constructors co 
kiewit for the construction of the marsh landing generating facility 
under the epc agreement  kiewit is to design and construct the marsh landing generating facility on a turnkey basis  including all engineering  procurement  construction  commissioning  training  start up and testing 
the lump sum cost of the epc agreement is million including the million total cost under the siemens turbine generator supply and services agreement which was assigned to kiewit in connection with the execution of the epc agreement  plus the reimbursement of california sales and use taxes 
see debt obligations  off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations in liquidity and capital resources for additional information on the epc agreement with kiewit 
on october   genon marsh landing entered into a credit agreement for up to million of commitments to finance the marsh landing generating facility 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
genon marsh landing has received all permits necessary to begin construction and  on october   directed kiewit to commence engineering and procurement for the marsh landing generating facility 
construction of the marsh landing generating facility is expected to be completed by mid contra costa toll extension on september   genon delta entered into an agreement with pg e for the mw of contra costa units and for the period from november through april at the end of the agreement  and 
table of contents subject to any necessary regulatory approval  genon delta has agreed to retire contra costa units and  which began operations in  in furtherance of state and federal policies to retire aging power plants that utilize once through cooling technology 
pittsburg toll extension on october   genon delta entered into an agreement with pg e for  mw of capacity from pittsburg units  and for three years commencing january   with options for pg e to extend the agreement for each of and under the agreement  genon delta will receive monthly capacity payments with bonuses and or penalties based on heat rate and availability 
potrero settlement on august   genon potrero entered into a settlement agreement potrero settlement with the city and county of san francisco 
among other things  the potrero settlement obligates genon potrero to close permanently each of the remaining units of the potrero generating facility at the end of the year in which the caiso determines that such unit is no longer needed to maintain the reliable operation of the electricity system 
in december  the caiso provided genon potrero with the requisite notice of termination of the rmr agreement 
on january   at the request of genon potrero  the ferc approved changes to genon potrero s rmr agreement to allow the caiso to terminate the rmr agreement effective february  on february   the potrero facility was shut down 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the potrero settlement 
ibew local collective bargaining agreement during the second quarter of  we entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with our employees represented by ibew local located in maryland and virginia 
the previous collective bargaining agreement expired on june  the new agreement has a five year term expiring on june  as part of the new agreement  we are required to provide additional retirement contributions through the defined contribution plan  increases in pay and other benefits 
in addition  the agreement provides for a change to the postretirement healthcare benefit plan covering ibew local union employees to eliminate employer provided healthcare subsidies through a gradual phase out 
we recorded the effects of the plan curtailment during the second quarter of and recognized a reduction in other postretirement liabilities of million and a decrease in accumulated other comprehensive loss of million on the consolidated balance sheet and a gain of million reflected as a reduction in operations and maintenance expense on the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  we recognized an increase of million in our pension liability and in accumulated other comprehensive loss as a result of planned salary increases under the new collective bargaining agreement 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on the postretirement healthcare benefit curtailment 
results of operations upon completion of the merger  mirant stockholders had a majority of the voting interest in the combined company 
although rri energy issued shares of rri energy common stock to mirant stockholders to effect the merger  the merger is accounted for as a reverse acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting 
under the acquisition method of accounting  mirant is treated as the accounting acquirer and rri energy is treated as the acquired company for financial reporting purposes 
as such  the consolidated financial statements and results below of genon include the results of mirant  from january  through december   and include the results of the combined entities for the period from december  through december  the consolidated financial statements presented herein for periods ended prior to the closing of the merger and any other financial information presented herein with respect to such pre merger dates  unless otherwise specified are the consolidated financial statements and other financial information of mirant 

table of contents non gaap performance measures 
the following discussion includes the non gaap financial measures realized gross margin and unrealized gross margin to reflect how we manage our business 
in our discussion of the results of our reportable segments  we include the components of realized gross margin  which are energy  contracted and capacity  and realized value of hedges 
management generally evaluates our operating results excluding the impact of unrealized gains and losses 
when viewed with our gaap financial results  these non gaap financial measures may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting our business 
realized gross margin represents our gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization less unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments 
conversely  unrealized gross margin represents our unrealized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments 
none of our derivative financial instruments recorded at fair value is designated as a hedge other than our interest rate swaps and changes in their fair values are recognized currently in income as unrealized gains or losses 
as a result  our financial results are  at times  volatile and subject to fluctuations in value primarily because of changes in forward electricity and fuel prices 
realized gross margin  together with its components energy  contracted and capacity  and realized value of hedges  provide a measure of performance that eliminates the volatility reflected in unrealized gross margin  which is created by significant shifts in market values between periods 
we also disclose the non gaap financial measures adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda as consolidated performance measures  which exclude unrealized gross margin 
as mentioned above  management generally evaluates our operating results excluding the effect of unrealized gains and losses 
adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted ebitda also exclude items related to the merger and the former mirant bankruptcy  as well as impairment charges and net lower of cost or market adjustments to our commodity inventories and certain other items 
we adjust for the subsequent benefit created by commodity inventory utilized in operations that were subject to prior period lower of cost or market adjustments 
we exclude or adjust for these items to provide a more meaningful representation of our ongoing results of operations 
however  these non gaap financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled non gaap financial measures used by other companies 
we use these non gaap financial measures in communications with investors  analysts  rating agencies  banks and other parties 
adjusted ebitda is a key performance metric in our employee short term incentive structure for annual bonuses 
we think these non gaap financial measures provide meaningful representations of our consolidated operating performance and are useful to us and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another 
we view adjusted ebitda as providing a measure of operating results unaffected by differences in capital structures  capital investment cycles and ages of related assets among otherwise comparable companies 
we encourage our investors to review our consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on a single financial measure 

table of contents compared to consolidated financial performance we reported net loss of million and net income of million for and  respectively 
the change in net income loss is detailed as follows increase decrease in millions realized gross margin unrealized gross margin total gross margin excluding depreciation and amortization operating expenses operations and maintenance depreciation and amortization impairment losses gain on sales of assets  net total operating expenses  net operating income loss other expense income  net gain on bargain purchase interest expense  net equity in income of affiliates other  net total other expense income  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss realized gross margin 
for  our realized gross margin decrease of million was principally a result of the following a decrease of million in realized value of hedges 
in and  realized value of hedges was million and million  respectively  which reflects the amount by which the settlement value of power contracts exceeded market prices for power  offset in part by the amount by which contract prices for fuel exceeded market prices for fuel  partially offset by an increase of million in energy  primarily as a result of an increase in energy in eastern pjm because of an increase in the average settlement price for power  a decrease in the cost of emissions allowances  higher generation volumes and the addition of the western pjm miso segment in  offset in part by a decrease in realized gross margin from proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities in energy marketing and an increase in the average price of fuel  and an increase of million in contracted and capacity primarily as a result of the addition of the western pjm miso segment in as a result of the merger  an increase in ancillary services revenue and additional megawatts of capacity sold in eastern pjm  offset in part by a decrease in capacity prices in eastern pjm 
unrealized gross margin 
our unrealized gross margin for both periods reflects the following unrealized losses of million in  which included million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period  
table of contents substantially offset by a million net increase in the value of hedge and proprietary trading contracts for future periods 
the increase in value was primarily related to decreases in forward power and natural gas prices offset in part by the recognition of many of our coal agreements at fair value beginning in the second quarter of  and unrealized gains of million in  which included a million net increase in the value of hedge and trading contracts for future periods primarily related to decreases in forward power and natural gas prices  substantially offset by million associated with the reversal of previously recognized unrealized gains from power and fuel contracts that settled during the period 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses increase of million was primarily a result of the following an increase of million in impairment losses 
in  we recognized million in impairment losses related to our dickerson and potomac river generating facilities 
in  we recognized million in impairment losses related to our potomac river generating facility and intangible assets related to our potrero and contra costa generating facilities 
see note c to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our impairment reviews  an increase of million in operations and maintenance expense primarily related to the following an increase of million in merger related costs incurred in  which included million of advisory and legal costs and million related to severance  an increase of million related to the mc asset recovery settlement with southern company in  comprised of a million reduction in operations and maintenance expense for the reimbursement of funds provided to mc asset recovery and costs incurred related to mc asset recovery not previously reimbursed  and a million reversal of accruals for future funding to mc asset recovery 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the settlement between mc asset recovery and southern company  an increase of million related to the addition of the western pjm miso segment as a result of the merger  an increase of million related to the recognition of a liability associated with our commitment to reduce particulate emissions at our potomac river generating facility as a part of the agreement with the city of alexandria  virginia because the planned capital investment would not be recovered in future periods based on the current projected cash flows for the potomac river generating facility and the full impairment of the facility in see note c to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our impairment reviews  an increase of million primarily as a result of an increase in costs related to the operation of the scrubbers at our maryland generating facilities and the montgomery county  maryland co levy imposed on our dickerson generating facility beginning in may  offset in part by a decrease in planned maintenance costs in compared to  and an increase of million related to the accelerated vesting of mirant s stock based compensation as a result of the merger  partially offset by a decrease of million as a result of a curtailment gain recorded during the second quarter of resulting from an amendment to our postretirement healthcare benefits plan covering eastern pjm union employees 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the postretirement healthcare benefit curtailment  a decrease of million primarily related to lower property taxes because of a lower assessed value for the lovett generating facility which was demolished in and a decrease in shutdown costs associated with this generating facility  and 
table of contents a decrease of million related to severance and stock based compensation costs not related to the merger primarily as a result of the departure of certain executives in  an increase of million in depreciation and amortization expense primarily as a result of the scrubbers at our maryland generating facilities that were placed in service in december and the addition of the long lived assets acquired in the merger  and a decrease of million in gain on sales of assets primarily related to emissions allowances sold to third parties in gain on bargain purchase 
we reported a gain on bargain purchase of million during because the fair value of the net assets acquired in the merger exceeds the purchase price  the merger is being accounted for as a bargain purchase in accordance with acquisition accounting guidance 
the estimated gain on the bargain purchase is primarily a result of differences between the long term fundamental value of the generating facilities and the effect of the near term view of the equity markets on the price of mirant common stock at the close of the merger  specifically as a result of the following current dark spreads the difference between the price received for electricity generated compared to the market price of the coal required to produce the electricity have decreased significantly in recent years as a result of natural gas prices that are lower compared to historical levels and increased coal prices that are affected by international demand  uncertainty related to the nature and timing of environmental regulation  including carbon legislation  and certain generating facilities owned by rri energy prior to the merger being located in markets experiencing lower demand for electricity as a result of economic conditions but forecasted to have long term declining reserve margins 
the merger is accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations 
accordingly  we conducted an assessment of the net assets acquired and recognized provisional amounts for identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their estimated acquisition date fair values  while transaction and integration costs associated with the acquisition are expensed as incurred 
any changes to the fair value assessments will affect the gain on bargain purchase and material changes could require the financial statements to be retroactively amended 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the merger 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net increase of million was primarily a result of the following million increase primarily resulting from higher interest expense as a result of lower capitalized interest because of the scrubbers at our maryland generating facilities that were placed in service in december  and million increase related to interest incurred on our senior notes and credit facilities and interest expense on debt assumed in the merger 
other  net 
other  net change of million was primarily a result of the following million of other income  recognized in accordance with accounting guidance  relating to the reimbursement of pre merger interest paid by rri energy on genon s debt in accordance with the pre merger escrow arrangements  partially offset by million of other expense relating to the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the genon north america senior secured term loan that was repaid in adjusted ebitda and adjusted income from continuing operations 
the following table reconciles the non gaap consolidated performance measures adjusted income from continuing operations and adjusted

table of contents we and certain of our subsidiaries  including genon americas generation  are holding companies 
the chart below is a summary representation of our capital structure and is not a complete corporate organizational chart 
the genon credit facilities are guaranteed by certain direct and indirect subsidiaries of genon excluding genon americas generation  provided  however  that certain of genon americas generation s subsidiaries other than genon mid atlantic and genon energy management and their subsidiaries guarantee the genon credit facilities to the extent permitted under the indenture for the senior notes of genon americas generation 
genon americas is a co borrower under the genon credit facilities and the term loan balance is recorded at genon americas 

table of contents at december   the present values of lease payments under the genon mid atlantic and rema operating leases were approximately million and million  respectively assuming a and discount rate  respectively and the termination values of the genon mid atlantic and rema operating leases were billion and million  respectively 
at december   genon marsh landing had not drawn on its credit facility 
see genon marsh landing credit facility below for discussion 
except for existing cash on hand  genon and genon americas generation are holding companies that are dependent on the distributions and dividends of their subsidiaries for liquidity 
a substantial portion of cash from our operations is generated by genon mid atlantic 
the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions is restricted under the terms of their debt or other agreements  including the operating leases of genon mid atlantic and rema 
under their respective operating leases  genon mid atlantic and rema are not permitted to make any distributions and other restricted payments unless a they satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for the most recently ended period of four fiscal quarters  b they are projected to satisfy the fixed charge coverage ratio for each of the two following periods of four fiscal quarters  commencing with the fiscal quarter in which such payment is proposed to be made  and c no significant lease default or event of default has occurred and is continuing 
in the event of a default under the respective operating leases or if the respective restricted payment tests are not satisfied  genon mid atlantic and rema would not be able to distribute cash 
at december   genon mid atlantic and rema satisfied the respective restricted payments tests 
pursuant to the terms of their respective lease and debt documents  genon mid atlantic  rema and genon marsh landing are restricted from  among other actions  a encumbering assets  b entering into business combinations or divesting assets  c incurring additional debt  d entering into transactions with affiliates on other than an arm s length basis or e materially changing their business 
therefore  at december   all of genon mid atlantic s net assets excluding cash and all of rema s net assets excluding cash were deemed restricted for purposes of rule e ii of regulation s x 
the amounts of the deemed restricted net assets were as follows december  in millions genon mid atlantic rema genon marsh landing total restricted net assets the ability of genon americas generation to pay its obligations is dependent on the receipt of dividends from genon north america  capital contributions or intercompany loans from genon and its ability to refinance all or a portion of those obligations as they become due 
although we continue to evaluate our refinancing options  we expect to maintain adequate liquidity to retire the million of genon americas generation senior notes that come due in may genon marsh landing credit facility on october   genon marsh landing entered into a credit agreement for up to approximately million of commitments to provide construction and permanent financing for the marsh landing generating facility 
the credit facility consists of a million tranche a senior secured term loan facility  a million tranche b senior secured term loan facility  a million senior secured letter of credit facility to support genon marsh landing s debt service reserve requirements and a million senior secured letter of credit facility to support genon marsh landing s collateral requirements under its ppa with pg e 
the term loans are expected to be drawn during the construction of the project upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent thereto  including the receipt by genon marsh landing of base equity contributions of million 
prior to the commercial operation date of the project  the collateral requirements under the ppa 
table of contents and construction contracts are being met by a million cash collateralized letter of credit facility entered into by genon energy holdings on behalf of genon marsh landing on september  at or near the commercial operation date of the project those collateral requirements will terminate 
at december   genon marsh landing had not drawn on its credit facility 
the term loans are to be fully amortized by their maturity dates 
the tranche a term loan matures on december  and the tranche b term loan matures on the date that is the earlier of the last day of the first fiscal quarter following the tenth anniversary of the conversion of the credit facility from a construction facility to a permanent facility upon commercial operation of the marsh landing project and december  the expiry date of the letters of credit is december  interest on the tranche a term loans will be based on a base rate or a libor rate plus an initial applicable margin of for base rate loans and for libor loans with such margin increasing every three years 
interest on the tranche b term loans will be based on a base rate or a libor rate plus an initial applicable margin of for base rate loans and for libor loans with such margin increasing every three years 
fees on lenders exposure under the letters of credit accrue at a rate equal to the applicable margin payable on the tranche a term loans that are based on the libor rate 
an undrawn commitment fee applies at a rate of per annum 
in connection with the credit agreement  genon marsh landing entered into interest rate swaps to mitigate the interest rate risks with respect to the term loan 
genon energy holdings provided limited guarantees in respect of the interest rate swaps 
the effective interest rate that genon marsh landing will pay for the term loan from the commercial operations date is plus the step up in margin over time

management s estimates and judgments are inherently uncertain and may differ significantly from actual results achieved 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if the following conditions apply the estimate requires significant assumptions  and changes in the estimate could have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition  or if different estimates that could have been selected had been used  there could be a material effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
we have discussed the selection and application of these accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and our independent registered public accounting firm 
it is management s view that the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  actual results can differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
the sections below contain information about our most critical accounting estimates  as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop the estimates 
revenue recognition and accounting for energy trading and marketing activities nature of estimates required 
accounting standards require an accrual model to be used to account for our revenues from the sale of energy  capacity and ancillary services 
we recognize revenue when it has been earned and collection is probable as a result of electricity delivered or capacity available to customers pursuant to contractual commitments that specify volume  price and delivery requirements 
sales of energy primarily are based on economic dispatch  or they may be as ordered by an iso or rto  based on member participation agreements  but without an underlying contractual commitment 
iso and rto revenues and 
table of contents revenues for sales of energy based on economic dispatch are recorded on the basis of mwh delivered  at the relevant day ahead or real time prices 
sales that have been delivered but not billed by period end are estimated 
the accrual model is also used to account for our revenues from the sales of natural gas 
these sales are sold at market based prices through third party contracts 
sales that have been delivered but not billed by period end are estimated 
accounting standards require a fair value model to be used to measure fair value on a recurring basis for derivative energy contracts that are used to manage our exposure to commodity price risk or that are used in our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities 
we use a variety of derivative financial instruments  such as futures  forwards  swaps and option contracts  in the management of our business 
such derivative financial instruments have varying terms and durations  or tenors  which range from a few days to a number of years  depending on the instrument 
derivative financial instruments are recorded in our consolidated financial statements at fair value as either derivative contract assets or derivative contract liabilities  with changes in fair value recognized currently in income unless we have elected to apply cash flow hedging or they qualify for a scope exception pursuant to the accounting guidance 
management considers fair value techniques and valuation adjustments related to credit and liquidity to be critical accounting estimates 
these estimates are considered significant because they are highly susceptible to change from period to period and are dependent on many subjective factors 
transactions that are not accounted for using the fair value model under the accounting guidance for derivative financial instruments are either not derivatives or qualify for the scope exception and are accounted for under accrual accounting 
we recognize immediately in income inception gains and losses for transactions at other than the bid price or ask price 
key assumptions and approach used 
in determining fair value  we generally use a market approach and incorporate assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk and or the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation techniques 
the fair value measurement inputs we use vary from readily observable prices for exchange traded and over the counter instruments level or level to price curves that cannot be validated through external pricing sources level 
note to our consolidated financial statements explains the fair value hierarchy 
for most delivery locations and tenors where we have positions  we receive multiple independent broker price quotes 
in accordance with the exit price objective under the fair value measurements accounting guidance  the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities is determined based on the net underlying position of the recorded derivative contract assets and liabilities using bid prices for our assets and ask prices for liabilities 
if no active market exists  we estimate the fair value of certain derivative financial instruments using price extrapolation  interpolation and other quantitative methods 
we have not identified any distressed market conditions that would alter our valuation techniques at december  fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment 
our techniques for fair value estimation include assumptions for market prices  correlation and volatility 
the degree of estimation increases for longer duration contracts  contracts with multiple pricing features  option contracts and off hub delivery points 
our assets and liabilities classified as level in the fair value hierarchy represent approximately of our total assets and of our total liabilities measured at fair value at december  the fair value of derivative contract assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets is also affected by our assumptions as to time value  credit risk and non performance risk 
the nominal value of the contracts is discounted using a forward interest rate curve based on libor 
in addition  the fair value of our derivative contract assets is reduced to reflect the estimated default risk of counterparties on their contractual obligations to us 
the default risk of our counterparties for a significant portion of our overall net position is measured based on published spreads on credit default swaps 
the fair value of our derivative contract liabilities is reduced to reflect our estimated risk of default on our contractual obligations to counterparties and is measured based on published default rates of our debt 
the credit risk reflected in the fair value of our derivative contract assets and the non performance risk reflected in the fair value of our derivative contract liabilities are calculated with consideration of our master netting agreements with counterparties and our exposure is reduced by cash collateral posted to us against these obligations 

table of contents effect if different assumptions used 
the amounts recorded as revenue or cost of fuel  electricity and other products change as estimates are revised to reflect actual results and changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
because we use derivative financial instruments and have not elected cash flow or fair value hedge accounting for the majority of our derivative financial instruments  certain components of our financial statements  including gross margin  operating income and balance sheet ratios  are at times volatile and subject to fluctuations in value primarily as a result of changes in forward energy and fuel prices 
significant negative changes in fair value could require us to post additional collateral either in the form of cash or letters of credit 
because the fair value measurements of our material assets and liabilities are based on observable market information  there is not a significant range of values around the fair value estimate 
for our derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value using quantitative pricing models  a significant change in estimate could affect our results of operations and cash flows at the time contracts are ultimately settled 
the estimated fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities was a net asset of million at december  a change in electricity and fuel prices would result in approximately a million change in the fair value of our net asset at december  see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for further sensitivities in our assumptions used to calculate fair value 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further information on derivative financial instruments related to energy trading and marketing activities 
income taxes and deferred tax asset valuation allowance nature of estimates required 
we currently record a tax provision for state and federal income taxes including any alternative minimum tax as applicable 
we also recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the balance sheet carrying amounts and the tax basis of the assets and liabilities 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recoverable based on expected future taxable income 
to the extent that we determine it is more likely than not greater than a probability that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding our deferred tax assets and the application of a valuation allowance to our nols 
key assumptions and approach used 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
objective positive evidence is necessary to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for all or a portion of deferred tax assets when significant negative evidence exists 
we think that the realization of future taxable income sufficient to utilize existing deferred tax assets is not more likely than not at this time 
the primary factors related to this conclusion are as follows the prices for power and natural gas remain low compared to several years ago and the effect of these lower prices on the projected gross margin 
current weak economic conditions and various demand response programs have resulted in a decrease in the forecasted gross margin of our generating facilities 
the estimated cash flows from contracts in place that hedge economically a portion of our portfolio for future periods are less than the contribution to our gross margin from historical realized value of hedges in recent years 
at december   our deferred tax assets reduced by the valuation allowance are completely offset by our deferred tax liabilities 
additionally  our valuation allowance includes million relating to the tax effects of other comprehensive income items primarily related to employee benefits 
these other comprehensive income items will be reduced in the event that the valuation allowance is no longer required 

table of contents under the accounting guidance for the uncertainty of income taxes  we must reflect in our income tax provision the full benefit of all positions that will be taken in our income tax returns  except to the extent that such positions are uncertain and fall below the recognition requirements of the guidance 
in the event that we determine that a tax position meets the uncertainty criteria  an additional liability or an adjustment to our nols  determined under the measurement criteria of the guidance will result 
this liability or adjustment is referred to as an unrecognized tax benefit 
we periodically reassess the tax positions reflected in our tax returns for open years based on the latest information available and determine whether any portion of the tax benefits reflected therein should be treated as unrecognized 
the amount of the unrecognized tax benefit requires management to make significant assumptions about the expected outcomes of certain tax positions included in our filed or yet to be filed tax returns 
effect if different assumptions used 
as a result of the merger  each of mirant and rri energy has separately determined whether or not each had experienced an ownership change as defined in the irc 
irc section irc provides  in general  that an ownership change occurs when there is a greater than percentage point increase in ownership of a company s stock by new or existing stockholders who own or are deemed to own under irc or more of the loss company s stock over a three year testing period 
irc limits the amount of pre merger nols that can be used during any post ownership change year to offset taxable income 
we have determined that rri energy did not experience an ownership change as defined above 
prior to the merger  rri energy received guidance from the internal revenue service that specifies the methodology to be used in determining whether an ownership change has occurred under circumstances when a stockholder owns interests in each of the merging companies immediately prior to the merger 
our analysis concluded that sufficient overlapping stockholders of mirant and rri energy existed immediately prior to the merger such that the merger did not cause an ownership change for rri energy 
therefore  rri energy s pre merger nols have not been adjusted for any irc limitation 
mirant experienced an ownership change as a result of the merger 
we have reduced the amount of the mirant nols available to offset post merger taxable income based on the limits determined in accordance with irc we continue to be under audit for multiple years by taxing authorities in various jurisdictions 
considerable judgment is required to determine the tax treatment of particular items that involve interpretations of complex tax laws 
a tax liability is recorded for filing positions with respect to which the outcome is uncertain and the recognition criteria under the accounting guidance for uncertainty in income taxes has been met 
such liabilities are based on judgment and it can take many years to resolve a recorded liability such that the related filing position is no longer subject to question 
we have not recorded a liability for those proposed tax adjustments related to the current tax audits where we continue to think that our filing position meets the more likely than not threshold prescribed in the accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
any adverse outcomes arising from these matters could result in a material change in the amount of our deferred taxes 
long lived assets estimated useful lives nature of estimates required 
the estimated useful lives of our long lived assets are used to compute depreciation expense  determine the carrying value of asset retirement obligations and estimate expected future cash flows attributable to an asset for the purposes of impairment testing 
estimated useful lives are based  in part  on the assumption that we provide an appropriate level of capital expenditures while the assets are still in operation 
without these continued capital expenditures  the useful lives of these assets could decrease significantly 
key assumptions and approach used 
estimated useful lives are the mechanism by which we allocate the cost of long lived assets over the asset s service period 
we perform depreciation studies periodically to update changes in estimated useful lives 
the actual useful life of an asset could be affected by changes in estimated or actual commodity prices  environmental regulations  various legal factors  competitive forces and our liquidity and ability to sustain required maintenance expenditures and satisfy asset retirement obligations 

table of contents we use composite depreciation for groups of similar assets and establish an average useful life for each group of related assets 
in accordance with the accounting guidance related to evaluating long lived assets for impairment  we cease depreciation on long lived assets classified as held for sale 
also  we may revise the remaining useful life of an asset held and used subject to impairment testing 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our property  plant and equipment 
we completed a depreciation study in the first quarter of for the legacy mirant generating facilities that resulted in a change to the estimated useful lives of its long lived assets 
the change in useful lives resulted in an increase of approximately million in depreciation and amortization expense during in addition  the change in useful lives also resulted in an increase of million in asset retirement obligations and a corresponding increase of million in property  plant and equipment  net at december  effect if different assumptions used 
the determination of estimated useful lives is dependent on subjective factors such as expected market conditions  commodity prices and anticipated capital expenditures 
since composite depreciation rates are used  the actual useful life of a particular asset may differ materially from the useful life estimated for the related group of assets 
a increase in the weighted average useful lives of our facilities would result in a million decrease in annual depreciation expense 
a decrease in the weighted average useful lives of our facilities would result in a million increase in annual depreciation expense 
in the event the useful lives of significant assets were found to be shorter than originally estimated  depreciation expense may increase  liabilities recognized for future asset retirement obligations may be insufficient and impairments in the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets may result 
asset retirement obligations nature of estimates required 
we account for asset retirement obligations under the accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations and conditional asset retirements 
this guidance requires an entity to recognize the fair value of a liability for conditional and unconditional asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred 
retirement obligations associated with long lived assets included within the scope of the accounting guidance are those obligations for which a requirement exists under enacted laws  statutes and written or oral contracts  including obligations arising under the doctrine of promissory estoppel 
asset retirement obligations are estimated using the estimated current cost to satisfy the retirement obligation  increased for inflation through the expected period of retirement and discounted back to present value at our credit adjusted risk free rate 
we have identified certain asset retirement obligations within our power generating operations and have a noncurrent liability of million recorded at december  these asset retirement obligations are primarily related to asbestos abatement at some of our generating facilities  the removal of oil storage tanks  equipment on leased property and environmental obligations related to the closing of ash disposal sites 
during  a third party consulting firm completed a study on behalf of the company to determine the extent of asbestos present at certain of our generating facilities 
the consulting firm also provided us with cost estimates for the removal of the asbestos 
as a result  we revised the cost estimates associated with our asset retirement obligations for asbestos removal at all of our generating facilities 
key assumptions and approach used 
the fair value of liabilities associated with the initial recognition of asset retirement obligations is estimated by applying a present value calculation to current engineering cost estimates of satisfying the obligations 
significant inputs to the present value calculation include current cost estimates  estimated asset retirement dates and appropriate discount rates 
where appropriate  multiple cost and or retirement scenarios have been probability weighted 
effect if different assumptions used 
we update liabilities associated with asset retirement obligations as significant assumptions change or as relevant new information becomes available 

table of contents asset impairments nature of estimates required 
we evaluate our long lived assets  including intangible assets  for impairment in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
the amount of an impairment charge is calculated as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value  which generally represents the discounted expected future cash flows attributable to the asset  or in the case of an asset we expect to sell  at its fair value less costs to sell 
the accounting guidance related to impairments of long lived assets requires management to recognize an impairment charge if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows from a long lived asset or definite lived intangible asset is less than the carrying value of that asset 
we evaluate our long lived assets property  plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist or when we commit to sell the asset 
these evaluations of long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets may result from significant decreases in the market price of an asset  a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which an asset is being used or in its physical condition  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  as well as other economic or operational analyses 
if the carrying amount is not recoverable  an impairment charge is recorded 
the prices for power and natural gas remain low compared to several years ago 
the energy gross margin from our baseload coal units is negatively affected by these price levels 
additionally  the current weak economic conditions and various demand response programs have resulted in a decrease in the forecasted gross margin of our generating facilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our long lived assets for indications of impairment  however  given the remaining useful lives for many of our generating facilities  the total undiscounted cash flows for these generating facilities are more significantly affected by the long term view of supply and demand than by the short term fluctuations in energy prices and demand 
as such  we typically do not consider short term decreases in either energy prices or demand to cause an impairment evaluation 
our current expectation is that there will be a recovery in gross margins over time as a result of declining reserve margins in the markets in which we operate such that companies constructing new generating facilities can earn a reasonable rate of return on their investment 
this implies that gross margins and therefore cash flows in the future will be better than they are currently because market prices will need to rise high enough to provide an incentive for new generating facilities to be built and the entire market will realize the benefit of those higher gross margins 
key assumptions and approach used 
the impairment evaluation is a two step process  the first of which involves comparing the undiscounted cash flows to the carrying value of the asset 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the fair value of the asset must be calculated on a discounted basis 
the fair value of an asset is the price that would be received from a sale of the asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
quoted market prices in active markets are the best evidence of fair value and are used as the basis for the measurement  when available 
in the absence of quoted prices for identical or similar assets  fair value is estimated using various internal and external valuation methods 
these methods include discounted cash flow analyses and reviewing available information on comparable transactions 
the determination of fair value requires management to apply judgment in estimating future capacity and energy prices  environmental and maintenance expenditures and other cash flows 
our estimates of the fair value of the assets include significant assumptions about the timing of future cash flows  remaining useful lives and the selection of a discount rate that represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital consistent with the risk inherent in future cash flows 
our long lived asset impairment assessments typically include assumptions about the following electricity  fuel and capacity prices  costs related to compliance with environmental regulations  timing of announced transmission projects  timing and extent of generating capacity additions and retirements  and future capital expenditure requirements related to the generating facilities 

table of contents genon mid atlantic generating facilities we have goodwill recorded at our genon mid atlantic registrant on its standalone balance sheet  which is eliminated upon consolidation at genon north america 
in accordance with accounting guidance for goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to test the goodwill balance at genon mid atlantic at least annually 
we performed the goodwill assessment at october   which  by policy  is our annual testing date 
in conducting step one of the goodwill impairment analysis for genon mid atlantic  we noted that the carrying value of its net assets exceeded the calculated fair value of genon mid atlantic  indicating that step two of the goodwill impairment analysis was required 
based on the results of the step one goodwill impairment analysis  we tested genon mid atlantic s long lived assets for impairment under the accounting guidance related to impairment of long lived assets before completion of the step two test for goodwill 
upon completion of the assessment  we determined that none of the genon mid atlantic generating facilities were impaired at october  in december  pjm published an updated load forecast  which depicted a decrease in the expected demand from prior projections because of lower economic growth expectations 
as a result of the load forecast  our current expectation is that there will be a decrease in the clearing prices for future capacity auctions in certain years 
the decrease in projected capacity revenue caused us to update our october impairment review of genon mid atlantic s long lived assets 
the sum of the updated december undiscounted cash flows for the chalk point and morgantown generating facilities exceeded their carrying values  which represented approximately and of our total property  plant and equipment  net at december  however  we determined that the dickerson and potomac river generating facilities were impaired at december   as the carrying values exceeded the updated december undiscounted cash flows 
we recorded fourth quarter impairment losses of million and million on our consolidated statement of operations to reduce the carrying values of the dickerson and potomac river generating facilities  respectively  to their estimated fair values 
in addition  as a result of the full impairment of the potomac river generating facility  we recorded million in operations and maintenance expense and corresponding liabilities associated with our commitment to reduce particulate emissions at our potomac river generating facility as part of the agreement with the city of alexandria  virginia 
the planned capital investment would not be recovered in future periods based on the current projected cash flows of the potomac river generating facility 
our assumptions related to future electricity and fuel prices were based on observable market prices to the extent available and long term prices derived from proprietary fundamental market modeling 
the long term capacity prices were based on the assumption that the pjm rpm capacity market would continue to be consistent with the current structure 
for the dickerson generating facility  the total co costs under the levy were determined by applying the cost of co emissions to the expected generation forecasts 
our estimate of future cash flows related to the dickerson generating facility involved considering scenarios related to the montgomery county levy 
the scenarios are related to the success of the legal challenges to the law 
we also assumed that a federal co cap and trade program would be instituted later this decade which would supplant all pre existing co programs  including the montgomery county levy 
in addition  our assumptions included costs associated with compliance of other environmental regulations 
there are several transmission projects currently planned in the mid atlantic region  including the trans allegheny interstate line trail  mid atlantic power pathway transmission line mapp and the potomac appalachian transmission line path 
the assumptions regarding the timing of these projects were based on the current status of permitting and construction of each project 
the assumptions regarding electricity demand were based on forecasts from pjm and assumptions for generating capacity additions and retirements included publicly announced projects  which take into account renewable sources of electricity 
capital expenditures include the remaining contract retention payments for the completion of the maryland healthy air act pollution control equipment for our maryland generating facilities 
for our potomac river generating facility  the cash flows also include the remaining million that genon potomac river committed to spend to reduce particulate emissions as part of the agreement with the city of alexandria  virginia 

table of contents the estimates and assumptions used in the impairment analyses of the genon mid atlantic generating facilities are subject to a high degree of uncertainty  and changes in these assumptions could affect the amount of the impairment loss or result in additional future impairment losses 
a decrease in projected electricity prices or an increase in coal prices would decrease the future cash flows of the genon mid atlantic generating facilities 
additionally  decreases in the projected demand or changes to the structure of the pjm rpm capacity market could negatively affect the future capacity prices the facilities will earn 
the assumptions include the development of a potential federal cap and trade program for co emissions 
if we are not compensated for the costs of complying with a federal co program through allocated co allowances  increased electricity and capacity prices or decreased coal prices  the cash flows of the genon mid atlantic generating facilities would be negatively affected 
in addition  if pre existing co emission programs such as the rggi and the montgomery county levy are allowed to remain in effect under a federal co program  the cash flows of the genon mid atlantic generating facilities would be negatively affected 
if the planned transmission projects are completed earlier than assumed  this could negatively affect the cash flows of the facilities 
also  changes in assumptions regarding generating capacity additions and retirements in the pjm region could affect the cash flows  depending on the timing and extent of additions and retirements 
the assumptions include only those capital expenditures needed to keep the plants operational through their estimated remaining useful lives 
however  changes in laws or regulations could require additional capital investments beyond amounts forecasted to keep the plants operational 
the estimates of future cash flows did not include contracts entered into to hedge economically the expected generation of genon mid atlantic s generating facilities 
the cash flows related to these contracts were excluded because they were not directly attributable to each of the generating facilities 
for purposes of impairment testing  a long lived asset or assets must be grouped at the lowest level of independent identifiable cash flows 
each generating facility was determined to be its own group  which included the leasehold improvements for the leased generating units at the dickerson and morgantown generating facilities 
see note c to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our genon mid atlantic impairment analyses 
dickerson generating facility we also reviewed our dickerson generating facility for impairment in the second quarter of upon the enactment of the co levy by the montgomery county council 
upon completion of the assessment  we determined that the dickerson generating facility was not impaired in the second quarter of bowline generating facility during the second quarter of  the nyiso issued its annual peak load and energy forecast in its gold book 
the gold book reports projected electricity supply and demand for the new york control area for the next ten years 
the most recent gold book projects a significant decrease in future electricity demand as a result of current economic conditions and the expected future effects of demand side management programs in new york 
the expected reduction in future demand as a result of demand side management programs is being driven primarily by an energy efficiency program being instituted within the state of new york that will seek to achieve a reduction from energy volumes by as a result of the projections in the gold book  we evaluated the bowline generating facility for impairment in the second quarter of the sum of the probability weighted undiscounted cash flows for the bowline generating facility exceeded the carrying value 
as a result  we did not record an impairment loss for the bowline generating facility during the second quarter of genon bowline has challenged its property tax assessment for the and tax years 
although the assessment for the tax year was reduced significantly from the assessment received in  the assessment continues to exceed significantly the estimated fair value of the generating facility 
in the fourth quarter of  we identified certain operational issues that reduced the available capacity of the bowline generating facility 
we are in the process of evaluating long term solutions for the generating facility  but our current expectation is that the reduction in available capacity could extend through in the fourth quarter of  we again evaluated the bowline generating facility for impairment because of the expected extended reduction in available capacity together with the pending property tax litigation and the effect of supply and demand assumptions in the nyiso s gold book 
the sum of the probability weighted 
table of contents undiscounted cash flows for the bowline generating facility exceeded the carrying value 
therefore  we did not record an impairment loss for the bowline generating facility during the carrying value of the bowline generating facility represented approximately of our total property  plant and equipment  net at december  see note c to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our impairment analysis of the bowline generating facility 
emissions allowances in august  the epa proposed a replacement for the cair 
the market prices for so and so emissions allowances declined as a result of the proposed rule 
our historical accounting policy has been to include emissions allowances in our asset groupings when evaluating long lived assets for impairment 
however  to the extent the final epa rule significantly modifies or ends the current cap and trade program  we may evaluate whether our so and so emissions allowances included in property  plant and equipment and intangible assets should be evaluated separately from the underlying generating facilities 
the carrying value of the so and so emissions allowances included in property  plant and equipment and intangible assets at december  was million 
see environmental matters for further information on the epa s proposed replacement of the cair 
potrero generating facility in the third quarter of  genon potrero executed a settlement agreement with the city and county of san francisco in which it agreed to shut down the potrero generating facility when it is no longer needed for reliability  as determined by the caiso 
that settlement agreement became effective in november in december  the caiso provided genon potrero with the requisite notice of termination of the rmr agreement 
on january   at the request of genon potrero  the ferc approved changes to genon potrero s rmr agreement to allow the caiso to terminate the rmr agreement effective february  on february   the potrero facility was shut down 
the potrero generating facility was fully depreciated at december  the asset group for genon potrero included intangible assets recorded at genon california north related to trading rights and development rights 
as a result of certain terms included in the settlement agreement  we separately evaluated the trading and development rights associated with the potrero generating facility for impairment and determined that both of these intangible assets were fully impaired as of september  accordingly  we recognized an impairment loss of million on our consolidated statement of operations to write off the carrying value of the intangible assets related to the potrero generating facility 
see note c to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our impairment analysis of the potrero generating facility and related intangible assets 
contra costa generating facility on september   genon delta entered into an agreement with pg e for the mw at contra costa units and for the period from november through april at the end of the agreement  and subject to any necessary regulatory approval  genon delta has agreed to retire contra costa units and  which began operations in  in furtherance of state and federal policies to retire aging power plants that utilize once through cooling technology 
we evaluated the trading rights related to genon delta s contra costa generating facility for impairment during the third quarter of as a result of the retirement provisions in the tolling agreement 
because the contra costa generating facility is under contract with pg e through the expected shutdown date  we determined the intangible asset was fully impaired as of september  we recorded an impairment loss of million on our consolidated statement of operations to write off the carrying value of the trading rights related to the contra costa generating facility 
canal generating facility our  mw canal generating facility is located in the lower sema load zone in the iso ne control area 
iso ne previously has determined that  at times  it is necessary for the canal generating facility to operate to meet local reliability criteria for sema when it is not economic for the canal generating facility to operate based upon prevailing market prices 
when the canal generating facility operates to meet local reliability criteria  we are compensated at the price we bid into the iso ne  pursuant to iso ne market rules  rather than at the market price 

table of contents during  nstar electric company completed planned upgrades to the sema transmission system 
these upgrades are expected to reduce the need for the canal generating facility to operate and caused a reduction in energy gross margin compared to historical levels 
the final phase of these transmission upgrades was completed in the third quarter of with the completion of the transmission upgrades  we expect that the future revenues of the canal generating facility will be principally capacity revenue from iso ne forward capacity market 
our current projections indicate that the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value of the facility at december  as a result  we did not record an impairment charge because of the transmission upgrades 
we continue to monitor developments related to our canal generating facility  including the npdes and swd permit 
see item business environmental regulation for further information related to the npdes and swd permit for the canal generating facility 
the carrying value of the canal generating facility represented approximately of our total property  plant and equipment  net at december  genon mid atlantic generating facilities we have goodwill recorded at our genon mid atlantic registrant on its standalone balance sheet  which is eliminated upon consolidation at genon north america

during  the continued decline in average natural gas prices caused power prices to decline in the eastern pjm region 
additionally  weak economic conditions and various demand response programs have resulted in a decrease in the forecasted gross margin of the genon mid atlantic generating facilities 
upon completion of our assessment  which was based on the accounting guidance related to the impairment of long lived assets  we determined that the potomac river generating facility was impaired  as the carrying value exceeded the undiscounted cash flows 
we recorded an impairment loss of million on our consolidated statement of operations to reduce the carrying value of the potomac river generating facility to its estimated fair value 
in performing our impairment assessment  we noted that the undiscounted cash flows for other genon mid atlantic generating facilities also decreased significantly from the prior year 
we determined that no other genon mid atlantic long lived assets were impaired at october  genon mid atlantic generating facilities we performed the goodwill assessment for genon mid atlantic at october   which  by policy  is our annual testing date

upon completion of our assessment  which was based on the accounting guidance related to the impairment of long lived assets  we determined that no further analysis of the long lived assets was needed at december  effect if different assumptions used 
the estimates and assumptions used to determine whether an impairment exists are subject to a high degree of uncertainty 
the estimated fair value of an asset would change if different estimates and assumptions were used in our applied valuation techniques  including estimated undiscounted cash flows  discount rates and remaining useful lives for assets held and used 
if actual results are not consistent with the assumptions used in estimating future cash flows and asset fair values  we may be exposed to additional losses that could be material to our results of operations 
see note c to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on impairments 

table of contents loss contingencies nature of estimates required 
we record loss contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we consider loss contingency estimates to be critical accounting estimates because they entail significant judgment regarding probabilities and ranges of exposure  and the ultimate outcome of the proceedings is unknown and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we currently have loss contingencies related to litigation  environmental matters  tax matters and others 
key assumptions and approach used 
the determination of a loss contingency requires significant judgment as to the expected outcome of each contingency in future periods 
in making the determination as to potential losses and probability of loss  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including the expected outcome of potential litigation 
we record our best estimate of a loss  or the low end of our range if no estimate is better than another estimate within a range of estimates  when the loss is considered probable

in may  we concluded that we could no longer assert that physical delivery is probable for many of our coal agreements 
the conclusion was based on expected generation levels  changes observed in the coal markets and substantial progress in the construction of a coal blending facility at the morgantown generating facility that will allow for greater flexibility of our coal supply 
because we can no longer assert that physical delivery of coal from these agreements is probable  we are required to apply fair value accounting for these contracts in the current period and prospectively 
the fair value of these derivative contracts is included in the tables above 
we did not elect the fair value option for any financial instruments under the accounting guidance 
however  we do transact using derivative financial instruments which are required to be recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets under the accounting guidance related to derivative financial instruments

commodity price risk in connection with our business of generating electricity  we are exposed to energy commodity price risk associated with the acquisition of fuel and emissions allowances needed to generate electricity  the price of electricity produced and sold and the fair value of our fuel inventories 
a portion of our fuel requirements is purchased in the spot market and a portion of the electricity we produce is sold in the spot market 
in addition  the open positions in our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities expose us to risks associated with changes in energy commodity prices 
as a result  our financial performance varies depending on changes in the prices of energy and energy related commodities 
see item  critical accounting estimates for a discussion of the accounting treatment for asset management  proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities 
the financial performance of our business of generating electricity is influenced by the difference between the variable cost of converting a fuel  such as natural gas  coal or oil  into electricity  and the variable revenue we receive from the sale of that electricity 
the difference between the cost of a specific fuel used to generate one mwh of electricity and the market value of the electricity generated is commonly referred to as 
table of contents the conversion spread 
absent the effects of our derivative contract activities  the operating margins that we realize are equal to the difference between the aggregate conversion spread and the cost of operating the facilities that produce the electricity sold 
conversion spreads are dependent on a variety of factors that influence the cost of fuel and the sales price of the electricity generated over the longer term  including conversion spreads of other generating facilities in the regions in which we operate  facility outages  weather and general economic conditions 
as a result of these influences  the cost of fuel and electricity prices do not always change in the same magnitude or direction  which results in conversion spreads for a particular generating facility widening or narrowing or becoming negative over any given period 
through our asset management activities  we enter into a variety of exchange traded and otc energy and energy related derivative financial instruments  such as forward contracts  futures contracts  option contracts and financial swap agreements  to manage our exposure to commodity price risks 
these contracts have varying terms and durations which range from a few days to years  depending on the instrument 
our proprietary trading activities also utilize similar derivative contracts in markets where we have a physical presence to attempt to generate incremental gross margin 
our fuel oil management activities use derivative financial instruments to hedge economically the fair value of our physical fuel oil inventories  optimize the approximately three million barrels of storage capacity that we own or lease  as well as attempt to profit from market opportunities related to timing and or differences in the pricing of various products 
derivative energy contracts that are required to be reflected at fair value are presented as derivative contract assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the net changes in their fair market values are recognized in income in the period of change 
the determination of fair value considers various factors  including closing exchange or otc market price quotations  time value  credit quality  liquidity and volatility factors underlying options 
see item  critical accounting estimates for the accounting treatment of asset management  proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities 
counterparty credit risk the valuation of our derivative contract assets is affected by the default risk of the counterparties with which we transact 
we recognized a reserve  which is reflected as a reduction of our derivative contract assets  related to counterparty credit risk of million and million at december  and  respectively 
in accordance with the fair value measurements accounting guidance  we calculate the credit reserve through consideration of observable market inputs  when available 
we calculate our credit reserve using published spreads  where available  or proxies based upon published spreads  on credit default swaps for our counterparties applied to our current exposure and potential loss exposure from the financial commitments in our risk management portfolio 
we do not  however  transact in credit default swaps or any other credit derivative 
potential loss exposure is calculated as our current exposure plus a calculated var over the remaining life of the contracts 
our non collateralized power hedges entered into by genon mid atlantic with financial institutions  which represent of our net notional power position at december   are senior unsecured obligations of genon mid atlantic and the counterparties  and do not require either party to post cash collateral for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in power or natural gas prices 
our coal contracts included in derivative contract assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets also do not require either party to post cash collateral for initial margin or for securing exposure as a result of changes in coal prices 
an increase of in the spread of credit default swaps of our trading partners would result in an increase of million in our credit reserve at december  once we have delivered a physical commodity or agreed to financial settlement terms  we are subject to collection risk 
collection risk is similar to credit risk and collection risk is accounted for when we establish our provision for uncollectible accounts 
we manage this risk using the same techniques and processes used in credit risk discussed above 

table of contents we also monitor counterparty credit concentration risk on both an individual basis and a group counterparty basis 
see note c to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our counterparty credit concentration risk 
genon credit risk in valuing our derivative contract liabilities  we apply a valuation adjustment for our non performance which is based on the probability of our default 
our methodology incorporates published spreads on our credit default swaps  where available  or proxies based upon published spreads 
an increase of in the spread of our credit default swap rate would have an immaterial effect on our consolidated statement of operations for broker quotes the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities is based largely on observable quoted prices from exchanges and unadjusted indicative quoted prices from independent brokers in active markets who regularly facilitate our transactions 
an active market is considered to have transactions with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis 
we think that these prices represent the best available information for valuation purposes 
in determining the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities  we use third party market pricing where available 
note to our consolidated financial statements explains the fair value hierarchy 
our transactions in level of the fair value hierarchy primarily consist of natural gas and crude oil futures traded on the nymex and swaps cleared against nymex prices 
for these transactions  we use the unadjusted published settled prices on the valuation date 
our transactions in level of the fair value hierarchy primarily include non exchange traded derivatives such as otc forwards  swaps and options  and certain energy derivative instruments that are cleared and settled through exchanges 
we value these transactions using indicative quoted prices from independent brokers or other widely accepted valuation methodologies 
transactions are classified in level if substantially all greater than of the fair value can be corroborated using observable market inputs such as transactable broker quotes 
in accordance with the exit price objective under the fair value measurements accounting guidance  the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities is determined based on the net underlying position of the recorded derivative contract assets and liabilities using bid prices for our assets and ask prices for liabilities 
the quotes that we obtain from brokers are non binding in nature  but are from brokers that typically transact in the market being quoted and are based on their knowledge of market transactions on the valuation date 
we typically obtain multiple broker quotes on the valuation date for each delivery location that extend for the tenor of our underlying contracts 
the number of quotes that we can obtain depends on the relative liquidity of the delivery location on the valuation date 
if multiple broker quotes are received for a contract  we use an average of the quoted bid or ask prices 
if only one broker quote is received for a delivery location and it cannot be validated through other external sources  we will assign the quote to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy 
in some instances  we may combine broker quotes for a liquid delivery hub with broker quotes for the price spread between the liquid delivery hub and the delivery location under the contract 
we also may apply interpolation techniques to value monthly strips if broker quotes are only available on a seasonal or annual basis 
we perform validation procedures on the broker quotes at least on a monthly basis 
the validation procedures include reviewing the quotes for accuracy and comparing them to our internal price curves 
in certain instances  we may discard a broker quote if it is a clear outlier and multiple other quotes are obtained 
at december   we obtained broker quotes for of our delivery locations classified in level of the fair value hierarchy 
inactive markets are considered to be those markets with few transactions  noncurrent pricing or prices that vary over time or among market makers 
our transactions in level of the fair value hierarchy may involve transactions whereby observable market data  such as broker quotes  are not available for substantially all of the tenor of the contract or we are only able to obtain indicative broker quotes that cannot be corroborated by observable market data 
in such cases  we may apply valuation techniques such as extrapolation and other quantitative methods to determine fair value 
proprietary models may also be used to determine the fair value of certain of our derivative contract assets and liabilities that may be structured or otherwise 
table of contents tailored 
our techniques for fair value estimation include assumptions for market prices  correlation and volatility 
the degree of estimation increases for longer duration contracts  contracts with multiple pricing features  option contracts and off hub delivery points 
at december   our assets and liabilities classified as level in the fair value hierarchy represented approximately of our total assets and of our total liabilities measured at fair value 
value at risk our risk management policy limits our trading to certain products and contains limits and restrictions related to our asset management  proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities 
we manage the price risk associated with asset management activities through a variety of methods 
our risk management policy requires that asset management activities are restricted to only those activities that are risk reducing 
we ensure compliance with this restriction at the transactional level by testing each individual transaction executed relative to the overall asset position 
we also use var to measure the market price risk of our energy asset portfolio as a result of potential changes in market prices 
var is a statistical model that provides an estimate of potential loss 
we calculate var based on the parametric variance covariance approach  utilizing a confidence interval and a one day holding period on a rolling month forward looking period 
additionally  we estimate correlation based on historical commodity price changes 
volatilities are based on a combination of historical price changes and implied market rates 
var is calculated quarterly on an asset management portfolio comprised of mark to market and non mark to market energy assets and liabilities  including generating facilities and bilateral physical and financial transactions 
asset management var levels are substantially reduced as a result of our decision to actively hedge economically in the forward markets the commodity price risk related to the expected generation and fuel usage of our generating facilities 
see item  business asset management for discussion of our hedging strategies 
the following table summarizes year end  average  high and low var for our asset management portfolio asset management var in millions year end average high low we calculate var daily on portfolios consisting of mark to market and non mark to market bilateral physical and financial transactions related to our proprietary trading activities and fuel oil management operations 
the following table summarizes year end  average  high and low var for our proprietary trading and fuel oil management activities proprietary trading and fuel oil management var in millions year end average high low because of inherent limitations of statistical measures such as var and the seasonality of changes in market prices  the var calculation may not reflect the full extent of our commodity price risk exposure on our cash flows and liquidity 
additionally  actual changes in the fair value of mark to market energy assets and liabilities could differ from the calculated var  and such changes could have a material effect on our financial results 

table of contents interest rate risk fair value measurement we are also subject to interest rate risk when discounting to account for time value in determining the fair value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities 
the nominal value of our derivative contract assets and liabilities is discounted using a libor forward interest rate curve based on the tenor of our transactions 
it is estimated that a one percentage point change in market interest rates would result in a change of million to our derivative contract assets and a change of million to our derivative contract liabilities at december  debt some of our debt is subject to variable interest rates  including our million senior secured term loan and our million senior secured revolving credit facility 
borrowings under these facilities will bear interest at the libor rate plus a margin of and per annum  respectively 
however  for the new term loan facility only  in no event shall the libor rate be less than per annum 
we do not currently plan to enter into any interest rate swap agreements to mitigate the variable interest rate risk associated with our term loan facility or revolving credit facility 
in the future  we may enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility 
however  we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness  and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk 
with the senior secured term loan fully drawn  it is estimated that a one percentage point change in market interest rates above would result in a change in our annual interest expense of approximately million 
if the senior secured revolving credit facility was fully drawn  it is estimated that a one percentage point change in market interest rates would result in a change in our annual interest expense of approximately million 
the genon marsh landing credit agreement is also subject to variable interest rates 
the credit facility consists of a million tranche a senior secured term loan facility  a million tranche b senior secured term loan facility  a million senior secured letter of credit facility to support genon marsh landing s debt service reserve requirements and a million senior secured letter of credit facility to support genon marsh landing s collateral requirements under its ppa with pg e 
interest on the tranche a term loans will be based on a base rate or a libor rate plus an initial applicable margin of for base rate loans and for libor loans with such margin increasing every three years 
interest on the tranche b term loans will be based on a base rate or a libor rate plus an initial applicable margin of for base rate loans and for libor loans with such margin increasing every three years 
genon marsh landing entered into interest rate swaps to reduce the interest rate risks with respect to the term loan 
the effective interest rate that genon marsh landing will pay for the term loan from the commercial operations date is plus the step up in margin over time 
the interest rate swaps cover of the expected outstanding term loan balances during the operating period and a substantial portion of the expected outstanding term loan balances during the construction period 
the remaining borrowings during the construction period are still subject to variability in interest rates 
at the projected peak borrowing levels during the construction period  a one percentage point change in market interest rates would result in a change in our annual interest cost of less than million 
coal agreement risk our coal supply comes primarily from the northern appalachian and central appalachian coal regions 
we enter into contracts of varying tenors to secure appropriate quantities of fuel that meet the varying specifications of our generating facilities 
for our coal fired generating facilities  we purchase most of our coal from a small number of suppliers under contracts with terms of varying lengths  some of which extend to and one that extends to excluding our keystone and conemaugh generating facilities which are not owned by us and excluding our seward generating facility which burns waste coal supplied by an all requirements contract  we had exposure to three counterparties at december  and  that each represented an exposure of more than of our total coal commitments  by volume  for the respective 
table of contents succeeding year  and in aggregate represented approximately and of our total coal commitments at december  and  respectively 
at december   one counterparty represented an exposure of of these total coal commitments  by volume 
in addition  we have non performance risk associated with our coal agreements 
there is risk that our coal suppliers may not provide the contractual quantities on the dates specified within the agreements  or the deliveries may be carried over to future periods 
if our coal suppliers do not perform in accordance with the agreements  we may have to procure coal in the market to meet our needs  or power in the market to meet our obligations 
in addition  generally our coal suppliers do not have investment grade credit ratings nor do they post collateral with us and  accordingly  we may have limited ability to collect damages in the event of default by such suppliers 
we seek to mitigate this risk through diversification of coal suppliers  to the extent possible  and through guarantees 
despite this  there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful in mitigating credit risk from coal suppliers 
non performance or default risk by our coal suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
see note c to our consolidated financial statements for further explanation of these agreements and our credit concentration tables 
certain of our coal contracts are not required to be recorded at fair value under the accounting guidance for derivative financial instruments 
as such  these contracts are not included in derivative contract assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
these contracts contain pricing terms that are favorable compared to forward market prices at december   and are projected to provide a million benefit to our realized value of hedges through as the coal is utilized in the production of electricity
