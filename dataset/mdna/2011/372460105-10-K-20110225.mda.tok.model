total debt outstanding at december  was unchanged from million at december  results of operations our results of operations are summarized below for the three years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands except per share data net sales gross profit net income diluted earnings per share net sales consolidated net sales for the year ended december  totaled billion  an increase from driven by sales growth in all four of our business segments 
the industrial and electrical business segments experienced the greatest percentage increases for the year  as the manufacturing sector of the economy was much stronger in relative to these businesses also benefited from acquisitions in sales for the automotive business segment were much improved in as well  primarily due to the benefits of well executed internal initiatives and the overall improvement in the economy 
cumulatively  prices in were up approximately in the automotive segment  up approximately in the industrial segment  up approximately in the electrical segment and approximately flat in the office segment 
consolidated net sales for the year ended december  totaled billion  a decrease from each of our four businesses experienced sales decreases  with the industrial and electrical business segments showing the most significant declines  as the manufacturing sector of the economy was severely impacted by the weak economic conditions  which we began to experience in the latter part of the general weakness in demand resulting from lower consumer spending and industrial production and higher unemployment appeared to stabilize over the last half of among the four quarters in  the fourth quarter was the strongest period for sales in each business segment 
cumulatively  prices in were down approximately in the automotive segment  approximately flat in the industrial segment and up approximately in the office segment and in the electrical segment 
automotive group net sales for the automotive group automotive were billion in  an increase of from sales improved in due to the successful execution of our sales initiatives and the stronger economy  which drove increased demand for automotive maintenance and supply items 
automotive revenues were up in the first quarter  followed by increases in the second and third quarters  and a increase in the fourth quarter 
other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include the effect of currency  which positively impacted sales by approximately 
automotive sales were billion in  a decrease of from sales were impacted by the soft economy in  which reduced the overall level of consumer spending and  specifically  the demand for automotive maintenance and supply items 
the first half of the year proved to be the most challenging  with automotive sales down and in the first and second quarters  respectively 
sales were down in the third quarter followed by a increase in the fourth quarter 
other factors impacting our automotive sales for the year include acquisitions  which had an approximately positive effect on sales  and the effect of currency  which negatively impacted sales by approximately 

table of contents industrial group net sales for motion industries  our industrial group industrial  were billion in  an increase of compared to several factors contributed to the sales increase for this group  including the positive impact of their internal sales initiatives and the strong rebound in the manufacturing sector of the economy served by industrial 
this was evidenced by the ongoing improvement in the manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization indices  which this group tends to track 
also in  sales were positively impacted by acquisitions  which accounted for approximately of industrial s sales growth for the year 
as a result of these several factors  industrial revenues were up in the first quarter of  up in the second quarter  then up and in the third and fourth quarters  respectively 
net sales were billion in  a decrease of compared to through the first three quarters of the year  sales were especially weak for this group due to the effects of very low manufacturing activity  as evidenced by the reported levels of manufacturing industrial production and capacity utilization and its negative impact on demand for industrial products 
this weakness was widespread  as we experienced sales declines in nearly all of our major customer categories 
the industrial indices we follow showed some early signs of stabilization in the third quarter and we observed a slight strengthening in these indicators as we entered the fourth quarter 
industrial sales were down in the fourth quarter  which marked a significant improvement from the declines of the first three quarters of the year 
in  sales were positively impacted by several acquisitions  which contributed approximately to sales for the year 
office group net sales for sp richards  our office products group office  were billion in  up slightly compared to the prior year 
office revenues stabilized in relative to prior year trends  although the office products industry continued to experience soft market conditions throughout the year as a result of reduced business spending and the ongoing impact of elevated unemployment levels 
sales decreased approximately in the first and second quarters  were flat in the third quarter and were up by in the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter increase is significant  as the industry wide slowdown in office products consumption has pressured this group for several years and the fourth quarter of marks the first positive sales comparison for office since the second quarter of net sales were billion in  down compared to and the third consecutive year of decreased revenues for office 
this three year sales trend reflects the negative impact of higher white collar and service unemployment on office products consumption  which has affected the office products industry since in  sales improved sequentially  with decreases of   and in the first  second  third and fourth quarters  respectively 
for the year  sales were positively impacted by three acquisitions completed in  which contributed nearly to sales in office 
the increase in net sales due to acquisitions  as well as our sales initiatives  was more than offset by the prevailing poor conditions in the office products industry 
electrical group net sales for eis  our electrical and electronic group electrical  increased to million in  up from electrical sales increased by in the first quarter  and this was followed by increases of in the second quarter  in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter 
the revenue growth in was driven by our sales initiatives  which were strongly supported by manufacturing expansion during the year  as measured by the institute for supply management s purchasing managers index 
in addition  acquisitions in contributed approximately to electrical s sales growth for the year 
net sales decreased to million in  down from electrical sales declined by in the first quarter  in the second quarter and in the third quarter 
for the fourth quarter  sales were down 
manufacturing contraction  as measured by the institute for supply management s purchasing managers index  was evident through june and then began to stabilize and improve over the last half of the year 
this factor explains the quarterly sales trends at electrical in acquisitions had less than a positive impact on electrical sales in 
table of contents cost of goods sold cost of goods sold was billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
the increase in cost of goods sold from to is directly related to the sales increase for the same period 
cost of goods sold represented of net sales in  of net sales in and of net sales in the increase in cost of goods sold as a percent of net sales in relative to and reflects the impact of certain pricing adjustments implemented in automotive during as well as ongoing competitive pricing pressures in office 
these factors more than offset our gross margin initiatives to enhance our pricing strategies  promote and sell higher margin products and minimize material acquisition costs 
in  all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases  although the automotive and office increases were relatively immaterial 
in  our office and electrical business segments experienced vendor price increases 
industrial was flat and automotive pricing was down for the year 
in  all four of our business segments experienced vendor price increases 
in any year where we experience price increases  we are able to work with our customers to pass most of these along to them 
operating expenses selling  administrative and other expenses sg a increased by million or to billion in  representing of net sales and down from of net sales in sg a expenses as a percentage of net sales improved from the prior year due primarily to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with the sales increase for the year 
in addition  management s ongoing cost control measures in areas such as personnel  freight  fleet and logistics have served to further improve the company s cost structure 
after reducing the size of its workforce by approximately during and  the company added back only of that in including acquisitions  despite the increase in revenues 
in total  of the estimated million cost savings in  the company estimates that it added back approximately million in costs in  primarily associated with the increase in sales and earnings 
our management teams remain focused on the ongoing assessment of the appropriate cost structure in our businesses 
depreciation and amortization expense in was million  down slightly from the provision for doubtful accounts was million in  down from million in the decrease in bad debt expense reflects a much improved collections environment in relative to the prior year 
we believe the company is adequately reserved for bad debts at december  in  sg a was billion  down million or from and representing of net sales 
this compared to of net sales in this percentage increase was primarily due to the loss of expense leverage associated with the sales decrease for the year 
during  management implemented extensive cost control initiatives to offset this loss of leverage 
these measures eliminated approximately million in operating costs and helped drive the decrease in absolute sg a dollars for the year 
depreciation and amortization expense in was million  up slightly from the provision for doubtful accounts was million in  up from a million bad debt expense in total share based compensation expense for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding share based compensation 
non operating expenses and income non operating expenses consist primarily of interest 
interest expense was million in and and million in the decrease in expense relative to is the result of an improved interest rate on certain long term debt  effective november in other  interest income net of noncontrolling interests has increased in each of the last two years due primarily to our improved cash position and the elimination of certain noncontrolling interests in income before income taxes income before income taxes was million in  an increase of from million in as a percentage of net sales  income before income taxes was in  reflecting an increase from in in 
table of contents  income before income taxes of million was down from million in and as a percentage of net sales was  a decrease from in automotive group automotive income before income taxes as a percentage of net sales  which we refer to as operating margin  increased to in from in the improvement in operating margin for is attributed to the benefit of greater expense leverage associated with automotive s sales increase for the year 
automotive s initiatives to grow sales and control costs are intended to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 
automotive s operating margin increased to in from in the improvement in operating margin for is attributed to the benefit of cost reduction measures implemented during and industrial group industrial s operating margin increased to in from in the increase in operating margin in is due to the combination of greater expense leverage associated with a sales increase  cost savings and increased volume incentives 
industrial will continue to focus on its sales initiatives and cost controls to further improve its operating margin in the years ahead 
industrial s operating margin decreased to in from in the decrease in operating margin in was primarily a reflection of the extreme downturn in industrial demand that we began to experience in the fourth quarter of these conditions led to lower sales volumes in  which severely impacted our expense leverage despite significant cost reduction efforts 
office group the operating margin in office increased to in from in the increase in operating margin in reflects the positive impact of our cost savings initiatives combined with the benefit of higher volume incentives from suppliers 
the increase in incentives was due to our fourth quarter sales growth and related increase in purchase volumes  which allowed us to achieve higher program growth tiers with suppliers 
the operating margin in office was in  down from in the prevailing weakness in the office products industry that began in continued to pressure the operating margin at office in electrical group the operating margin in electrical decreased to in from in the decrease in operating margin is mainly due to escalating copper prices during the year  which generally do not affect profit dollars  but negatively impact margins as copper is generally billed to customers at cost 
the margin pressures associated with this industry standard pricing practice for copper more than offset the benefits of a stronger manufacturing sector in and greater expense leverage associated with a sales increase 
the operating margin in electrical decreased to in from in the decrease in operating margin was primarily a function of weak market conditions 
this factor outweighed the benefits of electrical s sales initiatives and expense savings 
income taxes the effective income tax rate of in was down from in the decrease from is attributable to favorable foreign income taxes for the year 
the income tax rate decreased to in from in the decrease from the rate is mainly due to tax free income in associated with a company retirement plan

accounts payable increased million or approximately from december  due primarily to increased inventory purchases related to the company s sales increase  improved payment terms with certain suppliers and other payables initiatives such as the ongoing expansion of our procurement card program 
goodwill and other intangible assets increased by million or from december  due to the company s acquisitions during the year 
the change in our december  balance for the pension and other post retirement benefits liabilities  down million or approximately from december   is primarily due to a change in funded status of the company s pension and other post retirement plans in and a million pension contribution during the year 
liquidity and capital resources the company s sources of capital consist primarily of cash flows from operations  supplemented as necessary by private issuances of debt and bank borrowings 
we have million of total debt outstanding at december   of which million matures in november and is accounted for as current debt at december  the remaining million matures in november in addition  the company has available a million unsecured revolving line of credit 
no amounts were outstanding under the line of credit at december  and the capital and credit markets were volatile over the last few years  although these conditions did not materially impact our access to these markets 
currently  we believe that our cash on hand and available short term and long term sources of capital are sufficient to fund the company s operations  including working capital requirements  scheduled debt payments  interest payments  capital expenditures  benefit plan contributions  income tax obligations  dividends  share repurchases and contemplated acquisitions 
the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was to at december   and before consideration of current debt  was to this compares to to at december  our liquidity position remains solid

contractual and other obligations in october  the company entered into a sale leaseback transaction with a financial institution 
in connection with the transaction  the company sold certain automotive retail store properties and immediately leased the properties back over a lease term of twenty years 
the lease was classified as an operating lease 
net proceeds from the transaction amounted to approximately million 
the company realized a net gain of approximately million  which was deferred and is being amortized over the lease term 

table of contents the following table shows the company s approximate obligations and commitments  including interest due on credit facilities  to make future payments under specified contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations payment due by period less than over total year years years years in thousands credit facilities capital leases operating leases total contractual cash obligations due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with the company s unrecognized tax benefits at december   the company is unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement with the respective taxing authorities 
therefore  million of unrecognized tax benefits have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion on income taxes 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in our estimates 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current distribution needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
the company does not have significant agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements 
the company guarantees the borrowings of certain independently owned automotive parts stores independents and certain other affiliates in which the company has a noncontrolling equity ownership interest affiliates 
the company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these independents and affiliates is generally equal to the total borrowings subject to the company s guarantee 
to date  the company has had no significant losses in connection with guarantees of independents and affiliates borrowings 
the following table shows the company s approximate commercial commitments as of december  other commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than over committed year years years years in thousands line of credit standby letters of credit guaranteed borrowings of independents and affiliates total commercial commitments in addition  the company sponsors defined benefit pension plans that may obligate us to make contributions to the plans from time to time 
contributions in were million 
we expect to make a million cash contribution to our qualified defined benefit plans in  and contributions required for and future years will depend on a number of unpredictable factors including the market performance of the plans assets and future changes in interest rates that affect the actuarial measurement of the plans obligations 
share repurchases in  the company repurchased approximately million shares and the company had remaining authority to purchase approximately million shares at december  
table of contents critical accounting policies general management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we describe in this section certain critical accounting policies that require us to make significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
for further information on the critical accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
inventories provisions for slow moving and obsolescence the company identifies slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimates appropriate loss provisions related thereto 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant as the vast majority of the company s inventories are not highly susceptible to obsolescence and are eligible for return under various vendor return programs 
while the company has no reason to believe its inventory return privileges will be discontinued in the future  its risk of loss associated with obsolete or slow moving inventories would increase if such were to occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology the company evaluates the collectability of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
initially  the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of net sales based on historical bad debt experience 
this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when the company becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
while the company has a large customer base that is geographically dispersed  a general economic downturn in any of the industry segments in which the company operates could result in higher than expected defaults and  therefore  the need to revise estimates for bad debts 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded provisions for bad debts of million  million  and million  respectively 
consideration received from vendors the company enters into agreements at the beginning of each year with many of its vendors that provide for inventory purchase incentives 
generally  the company earns inventory purchase incentives upon achieving specified volume purchasing levels or other criteria 
the company accrues for the receipt of these incentives as part of its inventory cost based on cumulative purchases of inventory to date and projected inventory purchases through the end of the year 
while management believes the company will continue to receive consideration from vendors in and beyond  there can be no assurance that vendors will continue to provide comparable amounts of incentives in the future or that we will be able to achieve the specified volumes necessary to take advantage of such incentives 

table of contents impairment of property  plant and equipment and goodwill and other intangible assets at least annually  the company evaluates property  plant and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment indicators 
the company s judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance  among other factors 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired 
evaluating for impairment also requires the company to estimate future operating results and cash flows which require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
employee benefit plans the company s benefit plan committees in the us and canada establish investment policies and strategies and regularly monitor the performance of the company s pension plan assets 
the pension plan investment strategy implemented by the company s management is to achieve long term objectives and invest the pension assets in accordance with the applicable pension legislation in the us and canada and fiduciary standards 
the long term primary objectives for the pension plan funds are to provide for a reasonable amount of long term growth of capital without undue exposure to risk  protect the assets from erosion of purchasing power and provide investment results that meet or exceed the pension plan s actuarially assumed long term rate of return 
the company s investment strategy with respect to pension plan assets is to generate a return in excess of the passive portfolio benchmark s p index  russell mid cap index  russell index  msci eafe index  and barcap us govt credit 
we make several critical assumptions in determining our pension plan liabilities and related pension expense 
we believe the most critical of these assumptions are the expected rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate 
other assumptions we make relate to employee demographic factors such as rate of compensation increases  mortality rates  retirement patterns and turnover rates 
based on the investment policy for the pension plans  as well as an asset study that was performed based on the company s asset allocations and future expectations  the company s expected rate of return on plan assets for measuring pension expense or income is for the plans 
the asset study forecasted expected rates of return for the approximate duration of the company s benefit obligations  using capital market data and historical relationships 
the discount rate is chosen as the rate at which pension obligations could be effectively settled and is based on capital market conditions as of the measurement date 
we have matched the timing and duration of the expected cash flows of our pension obligations to a yield curve generated from a broad portfolio of high quality fixed income debt instruments to select our discount rate 
based upon this cash flow matching analysis  we selected a weighted average discount rate for the plans of at december  net periodic benefit cost for our defined benefit pension plans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decreasing trend in pension cost from to was primarily due to the curtailment and subsequent remeasurement which is discussed below  and the change in assumptions for the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate and the rate of compensation increases 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for more information regarding employee benefit plans 
in april  the company recorded a million non cash curtailment adjustment in connection with a reorganization  which reduced the expected years of future service of employees covered by the us defined benefit pension plan 
in july  the company announced changes to the us postretirement benefit plan 
effective january   future retirees no longer receive employer provided medical benefits and current pre retirees no longer receive employer provided post benefits beyond an access only arrangement 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following is a summary of the quarterly results of operations for the years ended december  and three months ended march  june  sept 
 dec 
 in thousands except per share data net sales gross profit net income earnings per share basic diluted net sales gross profit net income earnings per share basic diluted we recorded the quarterly earnings per share amounts as if each quarter was a discrete period 
as a result  the sum of the basic and diluted earnings per share will not necessarily total the annual basic and diluted earnings per share 
the preparation of interim consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions for the amounts reported in the interim condensed consolidated financial statements 
specifically  the company makes estimates and assumptions in its interim consolidated financial statements for the accrual of bad debts  inventory adjustments and discount and volume incentives earned  among others 
bad debts are accrued based on a percentage of sales  and volume incentives are estimated based upon cumulative and projected purchasing levels 
inventory adjustments are accrued on an interim basis and adjusted in the fourth quarter based on the annual october book to physical inventory adjustment 
the methodology and practices used in deriving estimates and assumptions for interim reporting typically results in adjustments upon accurate determination at year end 
the effect of these adjustments in and was not significant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk although the company does not face material risks related to interest rates and commodity prices  the company is exposed to changes in foreign currency rates with respect to foreign currency denominated operating revenues and expenses 
foreign currency the company has translation gains or losses that result from translation of the results of operations of an operating unit s foreign functional currency into us dollars for consolidated financial statement purposes 
the company s principal foreign currency exchange exposure is the canadian dollar  which is the functional currency of our canadian operations 
foreign currency exchange exposure particularly in regard to the canadian dollar and  to a lesser extent  the mexican peso  positively impacted our results for the year ended december  during and  it was estimated that a shift in exchange rates between those foreign functional currencies and the us dollar would have impacted translated net sales by approximately million and million  respectively
